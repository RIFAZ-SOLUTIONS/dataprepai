## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

7t h  &amp;  l ? h  June, 2022

## GALEBA. J.A.:

Prior to  1 s t  July  2014,  Tanga  Cement  Public  Limited  Company,  a Tanzanian  cement  manufacturer,  the  appellant,  had  hired  her  wholly owned subsidiary called Cement Distributors East Africa Limited (CDEAL) to provide  services  of  marketing  and  distribution  of  her  products, namely  cement.  CDEAL  was  the  major  distributor  of  the  appellant's products  during  the  time  of their  agreement.  However,  responding  to market challenges and dynamics of the appellant's product in the same year 2014, the appellant made a business decision to terminate CDEAL's marketing and distributorship services, such that cement marketing and distribution,  would  from  then,  be  carried  out  by  the  appellant  herself without CDEAL's involvement. Following cessation of the dealership, the appellant paid TZS. 1,270,298,73.00 (the disputed amount) to CDEAL.

In April and May  2016,  Tanzania Revenue  Authority,  whose principal  officer is the respondent,  under the tax revenue  laws,  carried out  a  tax  audit  in  respect  of the  appellant's  business  and  investment affairs.  Following that exercise and after numerous communications and consultations between the appellant's tax consultants and the respondent's representatives, on 31s t  May 2017 the respondent issued a notice of adjusted assessment,  under the law, disallowing the disputed amount  because,  according  to  her,  the  money  was  not  wholly  and exclusively expended in the production of the appellant's income.

According  to  the  appellant  in its notice  of  objection  to  the respondent  and  its  statement  of  facts  and  grounds  to  support  her

appeal in the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board), at pages 15 and 253 of the record of appeal respectively, this payment was compensation  for CDEAL's  loss of customers and  business  opportunity following the appellant's operational  decision to terminate CDEAL from its marketing and distributorship role.

The respondent's clear position was that compensation to a third party for the  latter's  loss  of customers  or opportunity,  cannot,  in  any way,  as  alleged  by  the  appellant,  be  deemed  to  be  payment  for advertisement or marketing for the appellant's products, which would be otherwise an allowable expenditure.

The treatment of the said disputed amount by the respondent as an  expense  not spent wholly and  exclusively on  the  production  of the appellant's income, led the appellant to file Income Tax Appeal No. 226 of 2018 in the Board, and the first issue for resolution in that tax dispute was whether the respondent's decision to disallow the disputed amount was legally correct.

In  addition  to the above dispute  between the  parties,  there was yet  another  tax  issue  in  the  same  year  of  income  2014,  which  was whether the  respondent's decision to imposed  underestimated  interest of TZS. 730,534,130.30 was, in law, a correct action to take. This issue arose because there was in the year of income 2014 an underestimated taxable  amount.  The  appellant's  argument was  that  imposing  the  tax was  arbitrary  because  upon  discovery  of  the  error,  in  early  January 2015, she wrote a letter contained at page 378 of the record of appeal, dated 7t h  January 2015 informing the respondent of the anomaly but the latter did not respond to that letter.

The  Board  heard  parties  on  the  two  issues  and  finally  resolved both  in  favour  of  the  respondent.  Being  deeply  aggrieved  with  the decision of the Board, under section 16 (4) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act [Cap 408 R.E. 2002] (the TRAA), the appellant filed Tax Appeal No. 14  of  2020  in  the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  (the  Tribunal).  The grounds  upon  which  the  appeal  was  based  were  a  replica  of  its complaints  that  had  been  lodged  in  the  Board  and  dismissed.  The

Tribunal heard the parties on the appeal and at the end, like the Board, it dismissed it in its entirety for want of merit. This appeal is against that decision.  The  appeal  is  based  on  two  grounds  of  appeal.  The  first ground was amended with leave of the Court such that the two grounds of appeal, that we will deal with in this matter are as follows:

- "1 . The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred  in law for failing  to  hold that under section 11(2) of the Income Tax Act, the advertising  and  marketing  costs  paid  to Cement Distributors East Africa Limited for loss of customers is an allowable expense for tax  purposes.
- 2. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred  in law for failing to hold that the Board was wrong  to  analyze  the  evidence  before  it and  upholding  that  the  respondent  was justified to impose underestimated interest"

At the  hearing  of this  appeal  on  7t h   June,  2022,  the  appellant was represented  by Mr. Wilson  Kamugisha  Mukebezi learned advocate,

whereas the respondent had the services of Messrs. Harold Gugami and Cherubin Chuwa both learned Senior State Attorneys.

As written submissions for the appellant and the respondent had been filed under rule 106 (1) and (6) respectively, they were adopted at the hearing by the respective counsel.

In orally elaborating on what is contained in the appellant's written submissions,  in  respect  of  the  first  ground  of  appeal,  Mr.  Mukebezi argued that the disputed amount which was paid to CDEAL, was wholly and  exclusively  spent  on  the  production  of  the  appellant's  income because, with that payment, CDEAL was able to hand over customers to the appellant,  meaning that securing those customers was a marketing activity done by CDEAL.

In reply, Mr. Gugami submitted that before 2014 the appellant had an  agreement  with  CDEAL for  advertisement and  marketing  in  which case he was being paid a service fee recognized under section 83 of the Income Tax Act [Cap 332 R.E.  2019]  (the ITA) and the amount would be  deemed  to  have  been  wholly  and  exclusively  expended  in  the

production of income of the appellant. However, after termination of the agreement,  the  appellant  cannot  be  paid  any  money  in  respect  of advertisement and  marketing.  In  any event,  he added,  the appellant's own  witness  at  page  181  of the  record  of  appeal,  testified  that  the amount  was  a  compensation  to  CDEAL  following  termination  of  the service agreement with the appellant.

With the advantage of the record of appeal and the submissions of parties, we trust we are in a position to determine the first ground of appeal. To do so, we will start with section  11(2) of the ITA on which kind  of expenditure  is  allowable  in  business for  income  tax  purposes.

That section provides as follows:

"(2) Subject to this Act, for purposes of calculating  a  person's  income  for  a  year  of income from any business or investment,  there shall be deducted all expenditure incurred during the  year of income,  by the person  wholly and exclusively in the production of  income from the business or investment"

Our  determination  point  is  whether  the  disputed  payment  to CDEAL  was  expended  wholly  and  exclusively  by  the  appellant  in  the production  of income  from  its  business  or  investment.  In  the  case  of Bulyanhulu  Gold  Mine  Limited  v.  Commissioner  General  TRA, Consolidated  Civil  Appeals  No.  89  and  90  of  2015  (unreported),  this Court  highlighted  on  what  should  be  taken  as  a   criteria  in  deciding whether an expenditure is wholly and exclusively spent for production of income:

" What is to be decided in each case is the nexus between the alleged claim for deduction and the particular head under which it is claimed.  If the claim made is under section 16(1) and (2) of  the TTA  1973 the Appellant must establish sufficient nexus between the expenditure and its wholesomeness and exclusivity in the production of income as well as its necessity and reasonableness."

In  respect  of  Mr.  Mukebezi's  argument that CDEAL  handed  over customers to the appellant, we inquired from  him  whether CDEAL had

identifiable customers that he had control over, such that, she (CDEAL) could  hand them over to a third  party like the appellant. Although  his response  was  prolonged  and  mouthful,  it  was  incomprehensible  and non-directional.  What  we  remotely  gathered  from  his  submission  was that the nature of the cement industry demands arrangement where an outgoing  distributor  like  CDEAL  needed  to  be  compensated  for  loss of customers to whom  he  was supplying  the  cement during the time  he was  serving  them.  Nonetheless,  we  did  not  get  it  right  from  the appellant's side, as to why and how would one company (CDEAL in this case), give customers to another company (the appellant in this case) at a price, while the giver had no verifiable pool of customers, upon whom she  had  clear  mandate  to  command  as  from  which  cement  company should those customers purchase the product.  In this case,  there was no proof that CDEAL had in possession of a specified market segment or a cluster of customers who she would hand over to the appellant, upon cessation of their marketing contract.

In any event, consistently, in the notice of objection, in exhibit A5 and the evidence of Emmanuel James, AW1 at pages 253, 261 and 181 of the  record  of appeal,  respectively all  from the appellant's side,  it is clear that the money which was paid to CDEAL was to compensate that company for loss of customers and  business opportunity.  For instance, AW1 in his evidence at the above page stated thus:

". . . Tanga  Cement took  over  the  duties  which were being made (sic) by CDEAL and dealt itself to the customers.  Therefore, it was found that it could not leave it without compensation and also to maintain their  status..."

The question we asked ourselves is how payment to a third party i n   order to  maintain  its  status  could  be taken to  have  been  expended wholly and exclusively on the production of income of the appellant. As held in Bulyanhulu Gold Mine case (supra), we did not see any nexus clearly established between the expenditure and its wholesomeness and exclusivity  in  the  production  of  income  as  well  as  its  necessity  and reasonableness  to  the  production  of the  appellant's  income.  Actually,

the  nexus,  that is the contract for  marketing  and  advertising  between CDEAL  and  the  appellant,  according  to  available  records,  had  been terminated around the same time.

That is why we do not agree with Mr. Mukebezi when pressing on us to equate the concept of payment to CDEAL in compensating for her loss of  customers and business  opportunity with advertising and marketing in favour of the appellant.  Further, we do not agree that the disputed amount which was paid to CDEAL was a service fee within the meaning of section 83 of the ITA, particularly because the appellant and CDEAL had just terminated the agreement for advertising and marketing, where the section would have been applicable and therefore the  amount,  an  allowable  expense.  In  our  view,  the  respondent  was right to disallow the expenditure, for it did not fall within the purview of section  11(2)  of the  ITA.  We  accordingly  uphold  the  decision  of the Tribunal on that aspect, in which we find no merit in the first ground of appeal which we are constrained to dismiss.

In  respect  of ground  two,  the  appellant  had  two  paragraphs  of submissions.  First,  the  appellant's  side  was  in  agreement that indeed, the  appellant  underestimated  the  income  tax  payable  in  the  year  of income 2014. That was the first premise. The reason why the appellant was not supposed to be charged the underestimated interest, according to the appellant's counsel, is because when she discovered the anomaly i n early  January  2015,  she  voluntarily  rectified  it vide a  letter  to  the respondent  dated  7t h   January  2015. Mr. Mukebezi  added  that  the respondent was supposed to respond to that letter, otherwise, charging the  underestimated  interest  of  TZS. 730,534,130.30  was  arbitrary, hence  unlawful.  If  we  understood  Mr.  Mukebezi  well,  he  treated  the appellant's above letter as an application under section 79(2) of the ITA for extension of time to pay tax which was otherwise not paid within the time  provided  by  statute.  With  those  few  contentions,  he  moved  the Court to fault both the Board and the Tribunal on that point.

In  reply,  Mr.  Gugami  submitted  that the alleged  tax was  paid  in January  2015  after  expiry  of  the  relevant  year  of  income  on  31s t

December 2014, because the appellant's year of income 2014 started on 1s t   January  of that year. He  contended  further that the  revision  was sought outside the relevant year of income, so imposing the underestimated  interest  by  the  respondent  was  a  lawful  action.  He argued that the said letter dated 7t h  January 2015 was analyzed by both the Board and the Tribunal and in both instances, findings were made, refusing to give any effect to the letter.

We have considered the arguments of both  learned  counsel  and have also reviewed the necessary exhibits in question and the issue for our consideration,  we think,  is  whether the  respondent was  wrong  to impose tax in respect of interest for understated installment income tax i n  the year of income 2014. The relevant law is section 99 (1) of the ITA with the side notes "Interest for Understating Tax Payable by Installments." That section provides as follows:

"99 (1) This section applies where:

- (a) An  installment  payer's  estimate  or revised estimate of  income tax payable for a year of income under

section  89  which  shall  be  used  to calculate an installment of  income tax for the year of  income payable under section 88; shall  be less than;

- (b) 80 percent of  the income tax  payable by the payer for the year of income under section 4(1) (a) and (b) ("the correct  amount)."

According to the records, in this case the amount of tax paid by way  of  installments  was  a  total  of  TZS  10,700,000,000.00  and  the correct  amount  of  the  income  tax  was  TZS  15,016,157,980.70.  The undisputed calculations that were made by the Board, the instalment tax was 71.3% of the actual tax. The amount self-assessed being less than 80%  of  the  actual  amount,  the  respondent  was  right  to  invoke  his statutory powers to charge the tax as she did.

Secondly, Mr.  Mukebezi challenged the respondent for not having considered and  replied  to the  letter dated  7t h  January,  2015.  His  point was that,  by failure to  reply to the appellant's application  contained  in

that  letter,  and  instead  imposing  the  tax  was  an  arbitrary  act,  hence ill egal.

Mr.  Gugami's  reaction  was  that  the  letter,  if  it  was  aiming  at seeking  extension  of time  to  pay  the  tax  due,  it  ought to  have  been written  in  the  relevant  year  of  income,  in  this  case  the  year  2014. Having been written in 2015, the letter was irrelevant and would not be treated  as an  application  under section  79  (2)  of the ITA,  he insisted. His  point was that the  respondent  could  only  be  held  responsible  for having failed to attend to the letter had it been an application under the law, written and received in the year 2014.

We will start with section 79 (2) of the ITA which provides that: -

- "(2) On written application by a person, the Commissioner,
- (a) may, where good cause is shown extend the date on which tax or part of tax is payable including by  permitting payment of  the tax

(b)

## by instalments of  equal or varying amounts; and

shall serve  the  person  with  written notice of

the  Commissioner's  decision  on  the application."

[Emphasis supplied].

Under  the  above  section  upon  a  written  application  by  the  tax payer, the Commissioner may extend the day for payment of tax upon application  showing  good  cause supporting  the  prayer for extension of time.  With  that  understanding  we  will  proceed  to  the  letter  that  the respondent is challenged for not having attended to presumably under section 79 (2) (b) of the ITA.  The relevant substance of the letter dated 7t h  January, 2015 reads as follows:

" Dear  Sir/Madame,

## RE: REVISION OF  AMENDED PROVISIONAL TAX

Reference is made on the caption above.

In the course of  finalizing year end accounts for 2014 it was noted that there  was  omission  of TZS.  6,872,398,077.56/=  related to impairment of financial  investment  which  was  done  after filing  provisional  tax  leading to  reduction of taxable income.

We are now amending provisional tax for quarter four from TZS. 2,000,000,000/= which is already paid to  TZS.  2,900,000,000/=  after taking into account the amount impaired and the same will be paid  accordingly.

## Your faithfully,

## TANGA CEMENT COMPANY LIMITED . "

With respect to Mr. Mukebezi, we read nothing in the above letter which would have compelled the respondent to respond to it. A careful reading of the letter reveals that it was informing the respondent of the omission  the  appellant  had  noticed  while  finalizing  year  end  accounts which had led to the reduction in her taxable income. The letter further informs the respondent that the appellant would amend provisional tax

for quarter four.  That letter  has  no  request to the  respondent for any extension  of  time  to  effect  any  payment  of  any  tax.  It  is  only  an informative  letter  rather than  a  statutory application  under  section  79 (2) (a) of  the ITA  which  would  have  necessitated  action  of  the respondent  under  section  79  (2)  (b)  of  the  ITA.  In  a  nutshell,  the appellant usurped the respondent's power under the latter provision of the law.

In  the circumstances,  we find  no offence with  the silence of the respondent after receiving the above letter. In any event, Mr.  Mukebezi did not refer us to any provision of law that the respondent breached by not replying  to the  letter,  other than  contending  that she  acted  in  an arbitrary manner which is, in our view, an unwarranted accusation. It is our  considered  opinion  therefore,  that  the  respondent  was  right  for acting,  presumably  under  section  99  of  ITA,  to  impose  the  tax  as appropriate.  In  the  circumstances,  the  second  ground  of appeal  fails; and we dismiss it.

In the event, this appeal  has no merit, we hereby dismiss it with costs.
