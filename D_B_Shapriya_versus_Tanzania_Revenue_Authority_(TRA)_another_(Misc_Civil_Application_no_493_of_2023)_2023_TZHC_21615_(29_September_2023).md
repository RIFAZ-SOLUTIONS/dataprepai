## E.E. KAKOLAKI, J.

This  an  application  for  Mareva  injunction  brought  by  the  applicant  under certificate of urgency and in terms of the provisions of section 2(3) of the Judicature and Application of Laws Act , [Cap. 358 R.E 2019] (the JALA) and section 95 of the Civil Procedure Court, [Cap. 33 R.E 2019] (the CPC),  pleasing  this  Court  to  issue  her  a  temporary  injunctive  order restraining the 1 st Respondent, its agents, assignees and or workmen from informing  about  applicants  debts  and  collect  monies  from  the  applicant's customers. Cost of the application and other reliefs as this Court deems fit

to grant are also prayed for. This application is supported by affidavit and supplementary affidavit of Dipackumar Katok

, applicant's principal officer. When served with the application the respondents filed their counter affidavit strenuously resisting the merit of this application. Subsequent to that, they issued  a  Notice  of  preliminary  objection  on  point  of  law  questioning  the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the matter going thus, this court has no jurisdiction to determine this suit as per requirements of section 7 of the Tax Revenue Authority Appeals Act [Cap 408 R.E 2019] (the TRAA) and section 53(1) of the Tax Administration Act [cap 438 R.E 2019 ] (the TAA).

Briefly as garnered from the applicant's affidavit and supplementary affidavit in support of the application, the 1 st respondent assessed, established and issued  to  the  applicant  an  estimated  tax  liability  claims  totalling  Tshs. 11,050,140,362/= following completion of examination exercise, conducted for the year 2019, 2020 and 2021, in which the applicant responded by filing the objection. After consideration of the said objection, the 1 st  respondent re-assessed the documentations dully submitted by the applicant and finally on 19/05/2023 issued her with the Tax Demand Notice of outstanding tax liability to the tune of Tshs. 1,228,738,709/= payable in three months, in

which the applicant wrote back requesting for reconsideration on the ground that, her operation had ceased in a period between 18 th  October, 2016 to 17 th June, 2021, following unlawful freezing of her bank accounts by the DPP and 2 nd   respondent.  It  appears  surprisingly  on  31 st August,  2023,  the  1 st respondent via email notified the applicant of her intention to recover the outstanding Tax liabilities by issuing without further notice an Agency Notice to the applicant's customers (third parties) namely North Mara Gold Mining and METC Paulsam Company Limited, in terms of the provisions of section 67 of the TAA, after the applicant had failed to pay Tshs. 580,000,000= as part of the outstanding tax liability, the agency notices which were annexed to the e-mail bearing the same date. It is from that 1 st respondent's decision and notice issued to the applicant this application is preferred.

It is a cardinal principle that, a Court seized with a preliminary objection is first  required  to  determine  that  objection  before  going  to  merits  or  the substance of the case or application before it as the aim is to save time in a situation  where  there  is  a  point  of  law  that  will  dispose  of  the  matter summarily. See the cases of Shahida Abdul Hassanali Vs. Mahed M.G. Karji , Civil Application No. 42 of 1999 and Bank of Tanzania Vs. Dervan Valambhia , Civil Application No. 15 of 2002  (both CAT-unreported). At the

hearing of the raised point of preliminary objection applicant was represented by Ms. Salma Abdalah, learned advocate while the Respondents enjoyed the service of Mr. Erasto Ntondokoso, learned State Attorney who was also in company of Mr. Achileus Karumuna, the 1 st  respondent's principal officer.

It is Mr. Ntondokoso, who rolled the ball first submitting that, the application violates the provisions of section 7 of the TRAA and section 53(1) of the TAA, conferring  sole  jurisdiction  to  the  Tax  Revenue  Board  (the  Board)  to determine this application since it is in the civil nature in respect of an action taken  by  the  1 st Respondent  in  administering  revenue  law  by  recovering outstanding tax liability vide Agency notice under section 67(1) of the TAA providing that, where a tax payer fails to pay tax on time, the Commissioner General may serve the 3 rd  party who owes money to that payer a notice in writing requiring that person to pay the owed money to the Commissioner General. Therefore, by issuing Agency notice to the third-party debtor who is North Mara, the 1 st Respondent executed his statutory powers vested on her by revenue laws of our land. To fortify his argument the Court of Appeal decisions in Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority Vs. New Musoma Textiles Limited, Civil Appeal No. 119 of 2019 at page 4,

Bryson Bwire Mbonde Vs. Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No.88 of 2018 pages 9 and 12 and Tanzania Revenue Authority vs. Tango Transport company limited, civil appeal no.84 of 2009 at page 4  were  referred  all  providing  that,  matters  of  civil  nature  arising  out  of revenue laws has their  special  forum  established  by  the  law  to  entertain them and that, the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain those matters. He finalized his submission by arguing that, any attempt by this Court to entertain this application is tantamount to travelling outside its jurisdiction as it will be handling a dispute from revenue laws, which its jurisdiction is solely rested on the Board. He thus prayed the Court to strike out of this application with costs for want of jurisdiction.

In  her  reply  Ms.  Abdallah  having  prayed  to  adopt  both  affidavit  and supplementary affidavit  to  form  party  of  her  submission,  she  invited  this Court  to  overrule  the  objection  raised.  She  reasoned  that,  this  is  an application for mareva injunction under section 2(3) of the JALA and section 95  of  the  CPC  which  is  not  arising  from  the  1 st Respondent's  decision  in issuing agency notice. She contended that, the provisions of section 53 of the TAA as relied on by the respondents cannot be read in isolation with the provisions of sections 50, 51 and 52 of the TAA, for which neither TRAA nor

TAA provides for procedure to be adopted by the party seeking to apply for reliefs under mareva injunction or any provision requiring the party to go to the  board  for  the  said  relief.  And  added  that,  under  such  situation  the principle of harmonization of laws must apply. In her views therefore, the provisions of section 7 of the TRAA are irrelevant in the circumstances of this matter, thus this court is a proper forum to entertain the application as there is no provision requiring the applicant to go to the board. She finalised her submission by praying the Court to overrule the raised preliminary objection and allow the application to be heard on merit.

In rejoinder submission Mr. Tondokoso apart from reiterating his submission in chief argued that, the first respondent's act of issuing agency notice to third  parties  to  settle  applicant's  outstanding  tax  liabilities  falls  under  the definition of the term decision as provided under section 50(1) of the TAA.

Having visited the affidavit, supplementary affidavit and counter affidavit in support and against the application and accorded the deserving weight the rivalry submissions by the parties, it is now an opportunity for this Court to consider  and  determine  the  issues  pending  for  determination  which  are going thus:

- 1. Whether the notice of intention to issue Agency notice to third-party (applicant's customers) and the Notice itself issued by Commissioner General for TRA amounts to tax decision.
- 2. Whether this application is arising from the 1 st  Respondent's decision of issuing agency notice.
- 3. Whether this court has jurisdiction to entertain the matter.

To starting with, the 1 st issue is whether the issue of notice of intention to serve agency notice to appellant's customers by the Commissioner General of TRA amounts to tax decision. From both parties' submission as well as the deposed facts in both affidavit and supplementary affidavit by the applicant, I note parties' dispute arose out of 1 st respondent's act of 31.08.2023 as per annexure  as  DBS6  and  DBS7  of  paragraphs  4  and  5  of  the  Applicant's supplementary affidavit, when served the applicant by way of email with a notice of intention to apply enforcement recovery measures for overdue tax liability by servicing Agency notice to third parties (applicant's customers) namely North  Mara  Gold  Mining and METC  Paulsam  Company Limited ,  in  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  section  67  of  TAA.  The provisions of section 67(1) of TAA reads:

67.-(1)  Where  a  taxpayer  fails  to  pay  tax  on  time,  the Commissioner  General  may  serve  on  the  third  party  debtor who owes money to that taxpayer a notice in writing requiring that person to pay the money to the Commissioner General.

It is also discerned from applicant's averments in paragraphs 4,5,6 and 7 of the  affidavit  that,  upon  being  served  with  the  estimated  tax  liability  she exercised her statutory right of objection in terms of the provisions of section 51(1) of  TAA,  in  which  after  re-assessment  of  submitted  documents  and issue of corrected assessment, the applicant further requested for reconsideration and waiver of tax liabilities between 2019 to 2021, on the ground that her accounts were frozen by the state organs. Nevertheless, applicant did not reveal the outcome of the said request before she was served with the notice of intention to issue Agency notice which copies were annexed to the notice submitted her via email as stated in paragraph 7 of the affidavit and paragraphs 4 and 5 to the supplementary affidavit, the act which no doubt resulted bred this application by the applicant, in which Mr. Tondokoso accuses to have infracted the provisions of section 53(1) of TAA. Much  as  the  applicant  is  aggrieved  with  the  1 st respondent's  decision  of issuing  agency notice in which the 1 st   respondent believes has a right to exercise under the TAA, I have no difficulties in arriving to the findings that

there is pure tax dispute existing between the applicant and 1 st  respondent. In a situation akin to the present matter, in the case of Tanzania Revenue Authority Vs. Kotra Company Limited , Civil Appeal No. 12 of 2009 (CATunreported) the Court of Appeal held that:

''In  our considered opinion, this denial of liability to pay the assessed taxes and the assertion that liability exists, is a tax dispute between the two parties, pure and simple.''

While I am in agreement with Ms. Abdallah's proposition that, the provisions of section 53(1) of TAA cannot be read in isolation of other provisions of the law  in  determination  of  the  issue  as  to  whether  Commissioner  Generals' issuance of agency notice amounts to tax decision, I am of the settled view that, the provisions of section 50(4)(a), (b) and (c) of the TAA provides an answer to the above issue by listing down information or documents under which conclusive evidence can be drawn that a tax decision has been made and  the  same  is  correct.    For  purposes  of  clarity  I  find  it  imperative  to reproduce the contents of the said section 50(4)(a) to (c) of TAA which reads thus:

(4)  For  purposes  of  this  Act,  the  following  informations  or documents shall be considered as conclusive evidence that a tax decision has been made and the decision is correct-

(a) in the case of self-assessment, the tax return that causes the  assessment  or  a  document  under  the  hand  of  the Commissioner  General  purporting  to  be  a  copy  of  the  tax return;

(b) in the case of other assessments, the notice of assessment or a document under the hand of the Commissioner General purporting to be a copy of the notice; and

(c) in  the  case  of  any  other  tax  decision,  a  written notice of the decision under the hand of the Commissioner General or a document under the hand of the Commissioner General purporting to be a memorandum of the decision. (Emphasis supplied)

From the above exposition of the law tax decision is considered to have been made when assessment, document of assessment, notice of assessment or document purporting to the a copy of notice, is issued under hands of the Commissioner General for TRA as stipulated under subsection (4)(a) and (b) of  the  Act  or a written notice of the decision under Commissioner Generals hand or document purporting to be memorandum of the decision is issued. In this matter what was communicated to the applicant on 31/05/2023 by e-mail undoubtedly was the Notice of intention to issue Agency notice accompanied with two Agency notices, duly signed by officer of the 1 st respondent. In view of that fact, it is to the satisfaction of this

Court that, the Agency notice issued to the applicant by the 1 st  respondent amounts to tax decision by the Commissioner General within the precincts of section 50(4) (c) of TAA as it was a written notice or memorandum of decision issued to the applicant, resulting from applicant's default to pay tax in time. The first issue is therefore found in affirmative.

Next for determination is the 2 nd issue as to whether this application is arising from the 1 st Respondent's decision of issuing Agency notice. I think this issue need not detain this Court much as it is already found when determining the 1 st issue that, the 1 st respondent's act of issuing notice of intention to serve agency notice to applicant's customers for them to settle her tax liability, the decision which no doubt aggrieved her, hence filing of this application with intent to restrain the 1 st respondent from so acting. To hold otherwise as Ms. Abdallah seem to impress upon this Court, with due respect to her would be going  contrary  to  the  applicant's  prayer  in  the  chamber  summons  which reads:

- 2.  That  this  Honourable  Court  may  be  pleased  to  issue  a temporary  injunctive  order  restraining  the  Respondent,  its agent,  assignees,  and  or  workmen  from  informing  about

## applicant's  debts  and  collect  monies  from  the  applicant's customers.

It is apparent from the above prayer that, the applicant is seeking to restrain the  1 st respondent  from  effecting  her  decision  of  informing  applicant's customers about her debts and collection of monies from them.  In other words the application is seeking to restrain the 1 st respondent from effecting the Agency notice. I therefore find the 2 nd  issue is answered in affirmative as this application arises from the notice of intention to issue agency notice and its annexure served to the applicant by email.

The 3 rd and last issue is whether this court has jurisdiction to entertain the matter at hand. It is true and I agree with Ms. Abdallah's proposition that under our tax laws there is no specific provisions providing for procedure as to  how  and  where  an  application  for  mareva  injunction  should  be  filed. However, that does not mean that tax revenues laws do not provide for the forum,  procedures  and  reliefs  sought  by  the  applicant  arising  from  tax decision made by the Commissioner General of TRA under section 50(1) of TAA for issuing agency notice to the third parties (applicant's customers/debtors)  in which  the  applicant is seeking to restrain its implementation. The revenue laws such as TAA and TRAA in the present

matter, I find provides an alternative procedure for resolution and determination  of  appellant's  grievances  sought  to  be  addressed  in  this application. I find solace in that finding from the Court of Appeal decision in the  case  of Kotra  Company Limited (supra)  when  interpreting  similar revenue laws, the TRA Act and TRAA where the Court had this to say:

''It is clear from the above statutory provisions, therefore that the TRA  Act and  the Act provide an alternative procedure for the resolution and determination of all disputes  in  relation  to  any  act  or  omission  by  the Commissioner - General in the discharge of his powers and functions under the revenue laws.'' (Emphasis supplied)

The law under section 51(1) of TAA is clear that any party aggrieved by such tax decision under section 50(1) of the TAA, may file his objection to the Commissioner General and if dissatisfied with his decision further appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeal Board (the Board) as provided for under section 53(1) of the TAA. To bring into picture the above deliberation the provisions of sections 50(1), 51(1) and 53(1) of the TAA are hereby reproduced:

Section 50(1) of the Act reads:

50.- (1) The Commissioner General may, subject to subsection (2),  make  any  tax  decision  including  assessment  or  other

decision  or  omission  on  a  matter  left  to  the  discretion, judgement, direction, opinion, approval, consent, satisfaction or determination of the Commissioner General under a tax law that directly affects a person.

Section 51(1) of the TAA provides:

51.-(1) A person who is aggrieved by a tax decision made by the Commissioner General may object the decision by filing an objection to the Commissioner General within thirty days from the date of service of the tax decision.

## And section 53(1) is stating that:

53.-(1) A person who is aggrieved by an objection decision or other decision or omission of the Commissioner General under this  Part  may  appeal  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act.

As provided under section 53(1) of the TAA, any party aggrieved with the decision of the Commissioner General under section 50(1) of the TAA when appealing to the Board has to abide to the provisions of the TRAA. The said Board under section 7 of the TRAA is conferred with exclusively jurisdiction to entertain all proceedings of civil nature in respect of disputes arising from revenue laws. Section 7 of TRAA provides:

- 7. The  Board  shall  have  sole  original  jurisdiction in all proceedings of a civil nature in respect of disputes arising from revenue laws administered by the Tanzania Revenue Authority.

On the sole jurisdiction of the Board and Tax Revenues Appeal Tribunal the Court  of  Appeal  in  the  case  of Bryson  Bwire  Mbonde (supra)  when deliberating on applicability of the provisions of sections 7, 7A and 12 of TRAA had the following observation to make:

- 'Our understanding of these provisions is that all proceedings of civil nature arising out of disputes from revenue laws administered by the respondent ought to be dealt with by the Board.'

Similar  stance  was  taken  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  the  case  of Kotra Company Limited (supra) when dsicussing as to whether the High Court was crowned with jurisdiction to entertain the respondent's suit founded on tax dispute. The Court had the following observation to make:

- ''…there  is  no  dispute  that  the  Act  sets  up  the  Board  and Tribunal  and  vests  the  former  with  sole  jurisdiction  in  all proceedings of a civil nature in respect of disputes arising from the revenue laws administered by the appellant.''

I take note that this application is preferred under section 2(3) of JALA and section 95 of the CPC, conferring this Court with inherent powers to entertain any matter of civil nature in which no specific jurisdiction is provided for by the statute as the settled law is that court's jurisdiction in our land is purely statutory. See the cases of Shyam Thanki and Others Vs. New Palace Hotel (1971) EA 199 and Commissioner General of Tanzania Revenue Authority  Vs.  JSC  Atomredmetzoloto  (ARMZ) , Consolidated  Civil Appeal  Nos.  78  and  79  of  2018  (all  CAT  unreported).  The  sub  issue  for determination  here  is  whether  this  Court  is  crowned  with  jurisdiction  to entertain this application founded  on  the  dispute  over tax revenue administration as submitted by Ms. Abdallah? In my opinion the answer is found in the provisions of section 7(1) of the CPC which provides thus:

7.-(1) Subject to this Act the courts shall have jurisdiction to try  all  suits  of  a  civil  nature  excepting  suits  of  which  their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred.

Justice G.P Singh in his book Principles of Statutory Interpretation , 8 th Ed (2001) at page 581 as quoted in the case of Kotra Company Limited (supra) on jurisdiction of the Court observed thus:

''There is a strong presumption that civil courts have jurisdiction to decide all questions of civil nature. The exclusion of jurisdiction of civil courts is not to be readily inferred and such exclusion must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied.''

In this matter as alluded to above in Bryson Bwire Mbonde (supra) and Kotra Company Limited (supra), the jurisdiction to entertain dispute over tax decision made by the 1 st  respondent herein is solely vested on the Board as  a  special  forum  for  entertaining  dispute  of  civil  nature  arising  from administration of revenue laws. In the case of Attorney General Vs. Lohay Akonaay and Another [1995]  TLR  80  on  the  jurisdiction  this  Court  to entertain disputes on matters whose jurisdiction is solely vested in special forums had this to say:

''…courts would not normally entertain a matter for which a special forum has been established unless the aggrieved party can satisfy the court that no appropriate remedy is available in the special forum…''

See also the cases of Tango Transport case (supra) and New Musoma

Textile Ltd case (supra) where the Court of Appeal observed that, court would not entertain a matter for which a special forum has been established

by law, unless the aggrieved party can satisfy that no appropriate remedy is available in that special forum.

In the present matter Ms. Abdallah does not dispute that the jurisdiction to entertain tax decision disputes arising from either denial for consideration of tax assessment or any other request by the applicant or any decision by the Commissioner General including issuance of agency notice to the third party is crowned on special forum which is the Board. Glancing at the applicant's affidavit  and  supplementary  affidavit,  it  is  not  deposed  anywhere  to  the Courts satisfaction that, the said decision of issuance of agency notice was referred by her to the Board and the sought remedies denied as the Board under  section  17(1)(b)  of  the  TAA  is  vested  with  powers  to  issue  the remedies  sought  by  the  applicant  in  the  present  application  either  by reconciliation  or  mediation  or  arbitration  including  issue  of  injunctive  or declaratory orders. Section 17(1)(b) of TAA reads:

17.-(1) The Board and the Tribunal shall respectively have the power-

(a) N/A.

- (b) to resolve any complaint or appeal by mediation, conciliation or arbitration;

Since there revenue laws provides for remedies sought by the applicant in this application and given the fact that, she has failed to prove to this Court that,  no  appropriate  remedy  could  be  obtained  from  the  Board  and/or Tribunal, the forums whose decisions on final appeal lies to the Court of Appeal,  I  find  the  argument  by  Ms.  Abdallah  that,  there  is  no  specific procedures in the revenue laws for applying for mareva injunction with due respect to her is not only misplaced but also unfounded in law, as mareva injunction before this Court in tax decision disputes by the Commissioner General cannot be used to circumvent the clear and mandatory procedures governing disputes arising from revenue laws. In view of the above the third issue  is  answered  in  negative  in  that,  this  Court  has  no  jurisdiction  to entertain the application beforehand.

For the stated reasons, I find merit in the preliminary objection raised by the respondent and sustain it as truly this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the application before it. The application is therefore dismissed with costs for want of competence.

It is so ordered.
