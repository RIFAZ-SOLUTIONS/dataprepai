## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

27th  March &amp; 7t h  August, 2019

## WAMBALI. J.A.:

This  appeal  is  against  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  (the TRAT)  in  favour of the  respondent,  Commissioner General of Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) against the appellant, Alliance One Tobacco Tanzania Limited delivered on 16th  February, 2018 in Tax Appeal No.  16  of  2016. In  the  impugned  decision,  the  TRAT  confirmed  the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the TRAB) that dismissed with costs the appellant's appeal  contesting the  respondent's disallowance of

the  costs  on  direct  sales  incurred  by  her  wholly  and  exclusively  in  the production of its income.  Dissatisfied with that decision, the appellant has appealed to this Court. The appellant therefore prays for the appeal to be allowed, reversal of the decision of the TRAT on disallowed costs on direct sales and costs of the appeal.

However,  to  appreciate  the  background  which  led  to  the  dispute between the parties, we deem appropriate to briefly restate the facts as found by the TRAB and the TRAT.

It  is  not  disputed  that  on  31s t   December,  2003;  30t h   September, 2004 and 30th  September, 2008, the appellant filed its income tax returns for the years of income 2003,  2004 and  2008  respectively. In  response to the tax returns, the respondent on  1s t September,  2005 conducted an audit and  issued  notices of adjusted  assessment for the 2003 and  2004 years of income. The respondent also in 2011 conducted another audit for the years of income 2009 and 2010.  In that assessment, the respondent disallowed  several  corporate  tax  items  relating  to  capital  expenditure, inventory costs, loss of input stock and bad debt written off.  Moreover, a significant  transfer  pricing  adjustment  was  made  on  the  price  from  the appellant  to  its  sister  company  Alliance  One  International  AGA.  The respondent  also  imposed  interest  for  under  estimation  of  chargeable income.

It is in the record that as a result of that assessment that led to the disallowance of direct costs, among others, the appellant lodged with the respondent a formal notice objecting to the said assessment. She strongly contended that the disallowed costs were deductible as they were wholly and exclusively incurred  in the  production of the  income. However, the respondent did  not  agree  with  the  explanation  of the  appellant  as  the earlier assessment was confirmed.

As an immediate reaction to the refusal to reconsider the assessment,  the  appellant  lodged  several  appeals  to  the  TRAB. These were Appeals Nos.  120,  121 and 122 of 2013 and Nos. 26 and 27 of 2014 for the years of income 2009 and 2010 respectively which were consolidated  at the  hearing  before the TRAB. Nevertheless,  in  the end, the TRAB  ruled  in  favour  of the  respondent. Aggrieved,  the  appellant appealed  to  the  TRAT  which  overturned  the  decision  of  the  TRAB substantially  as  it  allowed  the  appeal  in  respect  of  the  1s t ,  2n d   and  4t h grounds of appeal, but confirmed its decision in respect of the disallowed direct sales costs and therefore dismissed the 3r d  ground of appeal.

Still  dissatisfied,  the  appellant  has  come  to  the  Court  armed  with four  grounds  of appeal. However,  at the  hearing  of the  appeal  it was agreed that essentially,  the appeal  is premised on only one ground, that is,  whether the TRAT was right in  law and in fact to uphold the decision of the respondent to disallow costs on direct sales.  The appellant strongly maintains that it was wrong  for the respondent to disallow the costs on direct sales incurred by her wholly and exclusively in the production of its income. On the other hand, the respondent defends the decision of the TRAT.

When the appeal was called on for hearing,  Mr. Alan Kileo assisted by Mr. Norbert  Mwaifwani, both learned counsel appeared  for  the appellant while  Ms.  Gloria Achimpota,  also learned counsel  appeared for the respondent.

Learned  counsel  for  both  parties  adopted  their  respective  written submissions  they  filed  in  Court  earlier  on  for  and  against  the  appeal. However, in view of the fact that only one issue is to be resolved by this Court, not every argument in the written submissions would be applicable in resolving this appeal.

In his  submission  in  support  of  the  appeal, Mr. Kileo  strongly criticized the TRAT for supporting  the decision of the TRAB which,  in  his view,  failed  to  realize  that  the  respondent  did  not  comply  with  the provisions of section 97 (c) of the Income Tax Act, 2004 (the ITA) which requires provision of reasons for any assessment made by the Commissioner General. Mr.  Kileo firmly submitted that as there were no reasons  that  were  given  by  the  respondent  for  disallowing  direct  sales costs, the appellant could not provide any meaningful evidence during the audit, assessment and even at the hearing of the appeal before the TRAB and  the TRAT as  required  under section  17  (1)  (b)  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act, Cap. 408 (the TRAA).  He argued that absence of the reasons for the assessment left the appellant not knowing what aspects she was required to prove to challenge the assessment made by the respondent.

The  learned  counsel  for the  appellant  maintained  that absence of the  respondent's  reasons  for the  disallowance of direct sales  costs  was fatal  as  the  appellant  was  deprived  of the  opportunity to  object to  the assessment on specific matters. He stated further that even the issue of importance  of  the  appellant  to  provide  evidence  to  the  respondent  to justify that the disallowance of those costs was  improper was raised  by

the respondent for the first time at the hearing of the appeal  before the TRAB.  According to his submission, as a result of lack of reasons from the respondent for the disallowed costs, the appellant was left unprepared to provide the relevant evidence to discharge the burden of proof properly. He  added  that the  appellant  reminded  the  respondent  on  the  need  to provide  her with  the  reasons for the disallowed  costs  but there  was  no response  hence  she  lodged  an  appeal  before  the  TRAB.  Moreover,  he argued  that  unfortunately,  in  its  decision  on  appeal,  the  TRAT wrongly differed  with  the  opinion  of one  member who supported the appellant's stand on the importance of the respondent's reasons for the assessment.

In  the  circumstances,  Mr.  Kileo  prayed  for  the  Court to  allow  the appeal  with  costs and  overturn  the  decision of the TRAT that confirmed the decision of the TRAB on that issue.

In response, Ms.  Achimpota  for  the  respondent  supported  the decision of the TRAT that confirmed the findings and decision of the TRAB on the disallowed costs by the respondent. She argued that the burden of proof lied on  the appellant to show directly  by documentary evidence how she arrived at those costs which she wanted to be allowed as direct sales as required  by  law. While she did  not disregard the importance of the provisions of section 97 (c) of the ITA,  she quickly submitted that as the dispute between the parties was referred on appeal to the TRAB after the disputed assessment was issued by the respondent, the appellant was supposed to tender relevant evidence at that stage to show that the same was erroneous. She argued  further that the requirement to substantiate the  claim  is  in  line  with  the  provision  of section  18  (2)  (b)  of the T R M which imposes a legal duty on a person disputing the assessment to prove that the same is erroneous or excessive at the  hearing  before the TRAB or  the  TRAT  to  secure  the  decision  in  her  favour. To  support  her contention,  she  referred  us  to  the  decision  of  this  Court  in Insignia Limited v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 14 of 2007 (unreported).

The learned advocate for the respondent, therefore, concluded that as  the  appellant  did  not  utilize  the  opportunity  provided  by  the  law  to adduce sufficient evidence to neither the TRAB nor the TRAT, she cannot seek  refuge  under  section  97  (c) of the  ITA  before  this  Court  as  the assessment has been finally determined substantially with only one issue left. She thus urged us to dismiss the appeal with costs.

Having  heard  the  counsel  for  the  parties  and  considering  their respective  submissions,  we think the  issue  to  be determined  is whether the TRAT was right in  law to uphold the decision of the TRAB in support of the respondent who disallowed the appellant's costs on direct sales.

We note that the center of complaint of the appellant in supporting the sole ground of appeal to be determined by this Court is on the failure of the  respondent to comply with  the  provision  of section  97  (c)  of the ITA.  At  this  juncture,  we  deem  appropriate  to  reproduce  the  relevant provisions of section 97 (c) hereunder: -

"Where the Commissioner makes an assessment under section 94 (3) and (4),  95 (2) or 96,  the Commissioner shall serve  a  written  notice  of the  assessment on  the person stating: -

- (a) N/A;
- (b) N/A;
- (c) The reasons why the commissioner has made the assessment;
- (d) N/A;

## (e) N/A.

It  is  not  doubted  that  Ms.  Achimpota  for  the  respondent  did  not disregard the requirement imposed by law under section 97 (c) of the ITA. However,  she  argued  that  since  the  appellant  appealed  to  the  TRAB against  the  respondent's  assessment  as  required  by  the  law,  she  was bound  to  tender  sufficient  evidence  before  the  TRAB  or  the  TRAT  on appeal  to  show  why  she  thought  the  respondent  allegedly  improperly disallowed the said direct sales costs.  She argued that the onus to prove that the disallowance of the direct sales costs was erroneous lied on the appellant's door. In this regard, she supported the decision of the TRAB and that of the TRAT which confirmed the disallowed direct sales costs.

In  order  to  appreciate  the  decision  of the TRAB  in  respect of this issue, we reproduce the relevant passages thus:-

- "... Therefore, failure to submit those documents created difficult to respondent to determine  taxable income for both AOTTL and AOIC,  which mean that AOTTL did not show which costs are related to direct costs o f  goods sold

hence  lack  o f  evidence  of  actual  costs  incurred  and corresponded payment

In claiming inventory costs on direct safes the claimant must produce proper tax invoices against each costs and evidence  or  actual  payment  made  by  the  Appellant. Therefore since the appellant did not  produce evidence of a proper tax invoice on each costs and evidence of  actual payments made its claim  for inventory costs on  direct sales was properly rejected"

The TRAB concluded further that:

"...it goes  without  saying  that  it  was  proper  for  the respondent to  disallow  the appellant's costs on  direct sales due  to lack  of supporting  invoices against each costs  and evidence  of actual payments  made  by  the appellant . "

Admittedly, the issue of adherence to section 97 (c) of the ITA which requires  provision  of  the  ieasons  for  the  assessment  made  by  the respondent  was  not  raised  as  one  of the  grounds  in  the  statement  of

appeal at the TRAB.  The relevant issue which was framed and agreed by the parties before the hearing and dealt upon  by the TRAB in respect of the disallowed costs was; "whether the Respondent was right in law in disallowing the inventory costs on direct sales". This was issue number six which  was  supposed to  be  determined  at the end  after the submissions of the parties on the same. However, at the hearing before the TRAB, the appellant consistently submitted that there were no reasons provided  by  the  respondent  for  the  disallowed  costs.  Nevertheless,  no evidence  was  tendered  in  support  of  the  appellant's  position  that  the disallowed  costs  on  direct  sales  were  incurred  wholly  and  exclusively  in production  of its  income. As  a  result,  the  TRAB  found  in  favour  of the respondent as stated above.

On its part,  the TRAT upheld  the finding and decision of the TRAB on that issue when it dismissed ground  three of the appellant's appeal in respect of the disallowed costs.  For avoidance of doubt we have to point out that ground three of the appeal was to the effect that:-

"That the Board erred in law and fact when it held that the Respondent was correct to disallow the Appellant's costs on direct sales due to lack of  supporting invoices."

In its decision, the TRAT agreed with the counsel for the respondent that the appellant failed to produce the required evidence to substantiate her claim. The TRAT emphasized that the appellant could have provided that evidence during the audit stage, during  the objection  or during the hearing of the case at the level of the TRAB.

We have to observe that while the complaint of the appellant before the TRAB on this issue was whether the respondent rightly disallowed the said  direct  sales  costs  on  production  of  its  income,  at  the  TRAT  the complaint remained substantially the same as reflected in the reproduced ground three above.  However,  we entertain  no doubt that the  need for the TRAB to address and decide upon  the  respondent's  non-compliance with the provisions of section 97 (c) of the ITA was not vividly presented by the appellant during the submission of the argument in support of issue number  six. For  purpose  of  clarity,  we  better  reproduce  the  relevant submission of Mr.  Kibuta,  the appellant's counsel in respect of this issue:

"Issue number six also related in the income year 2008 which  inventory  costs  were  disallowed  in  deduction. There are no dear  reasons  provided  by TRA for

disallowing the inventory costs. And the failure to state the reasons for disallowing is on itself  an act of  arbitrary. There is a second reason why you should find in favour of the tax payer in  this point In  making  the transfer pricing adjustment the costs of inventory is automatically adjusted. When  you  disallow  the  costs  of inventory separately you are doing a double disallowance which is not proper in  accounting  perspective. For  those  two reasons we submit chat disallowing the inventory costs is wrong."

In  response  to  the  sjbrnission  of  Mr.  Kibuta,  Mr.  Adelard,  Legal Officer for the respondent stated as follows: -

" Issue  number six regarding  disallowance  of inventory costs on  direct sales, the disallowance of this item was  based  on lack of evidence  on  actual  costs alleged to have been incurred and correspondent payments.  TRA was in need of  appropriate invoice against each costs and evidence of  actual  payment made  by  the  appellant. They  have  failed  to

discharge  that  obligation. The  allegations  that there was no clear reason for disallowing this item is unfounded. The reason for disallowance was based on  lack  of evidence  on actual costs incurred. With regard to allegation that pricing adjustments automatically adjusts the inventory costs from accounting perspective  is  not  true,  because  transfer pricing  is  on related part arrangements where direct sales in this item is [sic] relates to sales made locally. So the two cannot be/go together."

## [emphasis added].

We also think that it i-  not out of  place to point out that in his rejoinder to the submission of Mr. Adelard, as reflected at page 1185  of  the  record  of  appeal,  Mr.  Kibuta  emphasized,  among others, that: -

"...If  the  reason for  disallowing  for  failure  to provide evidence  this should have been said by

## TRA  by  the  umj and the  company  would have provided than

From the above quoted submissions of counsel for the parties,  it is clear that the issue that the  !  RAB was called upon to determine is whether the appellant proved the dtv.ial costs incurred on inventory costs on direct sales to be entitled  to the i^quisite tc.x relief as required  by  law. As we have demonstrated through the quoted paragraphs above, it is conceded that  there  was  no  direct  reference  to  section  97  (c)  of  the  ITA  when counsel for the parties mack  their respective submissions at the TRAB. In this regard,  no one can douot the fact that in  view of the submissions of the  parties,  the  TRAB  was  called  upon  to  decide  whether  there  was sufficient  evidence to sho.v that  the assessment  in respect  of  the disallowed costs  was  erroneous. Therefore, to come  to  a  different conclusion other than the one the TRAB arrived at, the appellant had the onus to prove to the contrary.

On the other hand,  m - . re is no d^ubt that the first reference to the provisions of section 97 (c) or the ITA was made by Mr. Alan Kileo, learned advocate for the appellant in his submission in support of ground three of appeal before the TRAT whc-ii he brieil/ stated as follows;

"... You wiii find chat in section 97 of the Income Tax Act , 200-'! assessment without reasons is not assessment. In terms of the law the assessment the respondent issued ought to have explained why this costs was disallowed.  Further the  appellant  during  the  objection  stage  sought explanation  from  the  respondent  why  this costs was disallowed  so that  the appellant  could  respond positively..  "

On  her  part,  the  respondent's  counsel,  Ms.  Achimpota  responded and  emphasized  that  the  appellant  had  a  burden  of  proving  that  she incurred the expenditure to De entitled  to the tax deductions she sought as it had a significant impaci on their tax liability.

In  this  regard,  we  think  that  as  during  the  submission  of counsel before the TRAB it was plash chat trie dispute between the parties on the issue  was  on  the  lack  of  evidence  on  supporting  invoices  of  which  the appellant had claimed to possess,  it is only the requisite evidence which could have guided the proper decision on the issue.  In the circumstances, the  appellant  would  have  requested  trie  TRAB  to  take  fresh  evidence

concerning the actual  costs  she  incurred  to  prove that  the  respondent's assessment  on  the  disjtio^od  direct  sales  costs  was  erroneous  as  the burden of proof was stlit  squarely  on  her  part. In  the  event,  she could have  urged  the  TRAB 10 auow  her  to  tender  that  evidence  under  the provisions of section  1/  (  l)  ,2) of the TRAA which provides as follows:-

- "(1) The Board and the Tribunal shad respectively have the power: -
- (a) To luKc ^/idence on oath
- (2) Notwithstanding  subsection  (1),  the  Board or  the Tribunal shall have the power to summon and hear any witness ana receive evidence in the manner and the same ex  i  era as if it were a court exercising civil jurisdiction in a civil  case and  the  provisions of  the Civil Procedure Code  relating to summoning of witnesses, the taking of testimony on oath,  and non-compliance with a  witness summon shall apply in relation to an appeal before tne Board but the Tribunal may not admit any fresh evidence sj  ve in the

circumstance tu which, the  High Court  may admit fresh ttwidence on a fust appeal in a civil case."

## [emphasis added].

Thus since the appellant did not urge the TRAB to take the relevant evidence after the respondent's submission and her rejoinder in respect of issue  number  six,  but  sno  instead,  appealed  to  the  TRAT  against  the finding  and  decision  or  u&lt;TRAli  in  respect  of  the  same  issue,  her complaint  on  that  ground  .s  unfounded.  She  could  have  applied  under section 17 (1) (a)and (2) of tneTRAA for the TRAT to admit fresh evidence in  respect of the said oxalic/.-eel costs js the burden of proof still  rested on her shoulder.  As she did not do so, she cannot complain at this stage of the second  appeal. We are settled  that the relevant question  before the  TRAT  was  whethci  the  appellant  offered  tangible  evidence  on  the actual  costs she incurred ui ;   direct  sales  to  be entitled  to the tax  reliefs. We are of the firm opinion that at that stage if the TRAT could have been properly moved to grant the requisite leave, it could have legally invoked the  provisions  of  section ., (n  (a)  and  (2)  of  the  TRAA to  take  fresh evidence as it was dealing  with the first appeal from the TRAB.

It follows that as che ;^ue of the necessity of  provision of evidence to prove that the respondent's assessment was erroneous arose dearly at the TRAB and later at the TRAT, the appellant had the burden of showing that the  respondent irnpiO j : - r ly   disallowed  the  said  costs as  required  by section 18  (2)  (b)  of me  fRAA.  For  the  sake  of  emphasis,  we  feel compelled to reproduce the said section hereunder: -

- "(b) the onus of  proving that the assessment or decision in respect of V vtn ch  an appeal is  preferred is excessive or erroneous snail oe on the appellant."

We  are  thus  of  tin settled  opinion  that  as  the  appellant  had preferred  an  appeal  in  .vhicri  the  crucial  issue  before  the TRAB  and  the TRAT  was  whether  the  respondent  improperly  disallowed  the  costs  on direct sales,  and  whether  the assessment was erroneous,  she was duty bound  to  prove  the  same.  ror  at  rhui  stage  the  assessment  had  been finally  issued  by the  respondent and  therefore  no  longer into  her  hands for  further  consideration. 1 1 is  in  this  regard  that  we  subscribe  to  the decision  of  this  Court  in insignia  Limited v. The  Commissioner General (TRA), (supra) where it was emphasized that: -

"The burden of  proof  in tax  matters  has often been  placed on the tax-payer...  The evidence which settles the final liability lies solely within the knowledge and competence of  the aggrieved tax-payer."

Therefore,  in  the  circumstances  obtaining  in  this  appeal,  as  the appellant  had  appealed  to  TRAB  and  later  to  the  TRAT  contesting  the entire  assessment  made  by  the  respondent, but  did not  utilize  the provisions of the law referred above to seek to be given leave to adduce evidence in  support of her claim  and  to challenge the  alleged  improper assessment,  she  cannot  currently  take  refuge  under  the  provisions  of section 97 (c) of the ITA. We are fully satisfied that after the respondent had  issued  the  final  determination  on  the  disputed  assessment,  the appellant  legally  contested  it  through  an  appeal  before  the  TRAB  as required  under section  16  (1) of the TRAA.  Similarly,  the appellant also rightly appealed to the TRAT against the decision of the TRAB as required by section  16 (4) of the TRAA. It was therefore her duty to show that the assessment made by the respondent in respect of the disallowed costs on direct sales was erroneous.

In the circumstances, if the intention of the appellant from the outset was  to  challenge  the  assessment  of  the  respondent  in  respect  of  the disallowed direct sales costs based on the issue of non-compliance of the respondent with  section  97  (c) of the ITA,  she would  have  indicated  so directly in  her statement of appeal at the TRAB and later at the TRAT to enable them to deliberate and decide upon that legal question. As that was  not done and the issue  before the TRAB or TRAT remained that of whether there was evidence on actual costs incurred on direct sales, the appellant was duty bound to prove through cogent evidence (supporting invoices) that the disallowance of the said costs was erroneous. Otherwise, we think that the TRAB and the TRAT cannot be blamed as the question  which  they  were  called  upon  to  adjudicate  required  sufficient proof and the burden lied on the appellant as provided  under section  18 (2) (b) of the TRAA.

In the event, we agree with the learned counsel for the respondent that the TRAT properly confirmed the decision of the TRAB on the issue of  disallowance  of  the  direct  sales  costs  as  no  cogent  evidence  was tendered  by the  appellant to the contrary. We do not therefore,  think,

with  respect,  that the TRAT wrongly  held  against the  appellant on  this point as stated by her learned counsel.

In  the  final  analysis,  in  view of the  reasons we  have  stated  above with respect to the sole ground of appeal, we have to conclude that this appeal is bound to fail. The consequence that follow is to dismiss it in its entirety with costs.
