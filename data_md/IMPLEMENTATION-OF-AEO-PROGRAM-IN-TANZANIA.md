## Background

The  East  African  Community  (EAC)  regional Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) program was conceived by the Commissioners of Customs  of  the  East  African  (EAC)  countries of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda,  Tanzania and Uganda in 2008 after the adoption of the World Customs Organization (WCO) SAFE Framework of Standards by the WCO Council in 2005. The Commissioners'  decision  was  in  line  with  the EAC Protocol  that  requires  the  EAC  region  to set up a Customs Union as one of the building blocks for regional integration. The decision was also prompted by the consideration that since the AEO program is about trade facilitation and the  security  of  the  supply  chain,  traders  and Customs stood to gain more if the whole supply chain  within  the  region  is  covered  under  one program.

The  AEO  program  is  a  WCO  program  that is being  implemented  worldwide.  It  aims  to enhance  Customs  efficiency  in  the  face  of increasing volumes of trade and the increasing vulnerability  of  the  international  trade  supply chain  to  security  threats  as  well  as  the  use of  the  international  trade  supply  chain  as  a conduit  for  high  security  risk  materials.  AEO program  tackles  these  challenges  by  shifting the perspective, so that instead of focusing on the  goods  themselves,  Customs  focus  on  the traders.  The  compliant  traders  are  therefore given  AEO  status  which  means  they  are  low risk  companies  and  can  therefore  be  trusted by  Customs.  This  implies  that  Customs  can handle  the  consignments  of  such  companies with less control compared to others. That way the AEO program is an instrument for growing compliance.

The  simplified  procedures  for  AEOs  have  had tremendous effect with regard to reducing the cost associated with movement and clearance of goods. The EAC is currently pursuing mutual recognition  with  other  trading  blocs,  a  move which  will  lead  to  EAC  AEOs  enjoying  more benefits when trading outside EAC region.

Joining  the  Regional  AEO  program  therefore opens the doors for unlimited opportunities and the key to unlock the potential of your business. It  is  the  Customs  way  of  supporting  business and for business to support development in the EAC region
