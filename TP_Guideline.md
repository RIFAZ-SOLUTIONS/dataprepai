## TRANSFER PRICING GUIDELINES

## PREFACE

The Transfer pricing  guideline  (hereinafter referred  to  as  the  guidelines) has  been  drafted  as  a  practical  guide  and  is  not  intended  to  be  a prescriptive or an exhaustive discussion of every transfer pricing issue that might arise.  Each transfer pricing arrangement case will be decided on its own  factors and  circumstances, taking into account the taxpayers' business strategies and commercial judgment. These  Guidelines  will  be periodically reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis.

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

Transfer pricing of goods, services and intangible properties are intercompany  pricing  arrangements  between  associated  parties  in  their transactions. When independent parties deal with each other, independent market  forces  shape  the  commercial  pricing  of  goods,  services  and intangibles  transacted  between  them.  However,  business  transactions between associates may not always reflect the dynamics of market forces. These Transfer Pricing Guidelines (hereinafter referred to as the Guidelines)  are  largely  based  on  the  governing  standard  for  transfer pricing which is the arm's length principle as set out under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the United Nations (UN) Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing  for  Developing  Countries,  (hereinafter  referred  to  as OECD/UN  Guidelines).  TRA  abides  by  this  arm's  length  principle  and believes that  this  is  the  most  appropriate  standard  to  determine transfer prices of related parties. Although some parts of the Guidelines have been adopted  directly  from  the  OECD  /UN  Guidelines,  there  may  be  areas which differ to ensure adherence to the Income Tax Act Cap.332 as well as domestic  circumstances.  In  this regard, the Guidelines  may  be reviewed  from  time  to  time.  Examples  used  in  the  Guidelines  are  for demonstrative purposes only. Thus, in dealing with actual cases, the facts and circumstances of each case must be considered before deciding on the applicability of any of the methods recommended in the Guidelines .

## 2.0 OBJECTIVE OF THE GUIDELINES

The  objective  of  these  guidelines  is  to  provide  taxpayers  with  guidance about the procedures to be followed in the determination of arm's length prices  and  provide  consistency  in  administration  of  the  Income  Tax  Act, Cap.332  and  its regulations taking into consideration the Tanzania business environment. These guidelines are therefore expected to provide a general over view as well as a practical guidance on issues and factors to  be  considered  in  arriving  at  an  acceptable  arm's  length  price.  These include among others:-

-  The rationale for adoption of arm's length principle.
-  The  framework  on  which  application  of  the  acceptable transfer prancing method is based.
-  The  general  principles of comparability which  form  the foundation of transfer pricing analysis.
-  Documentation by taxpayers which should be prepared and maintained  in  support  of  their  determination  of  the  arm's length price.
-  Treatment of intra group transactions.

-  The underlying principle adopted in these guidelines has their basis on our own tax statutes and the OECD/UN guidelines.

## 3.0   SCOPE

- 3.1 The Guidelines are applicable on controlled transactions for the acquisition or supply of property or services between associated persons, where  at  least  one  person  is  assessable  or  chargeable  to  tax  in  the United Republic of Tanzania.
- 3.2 The guidelines are applicable to Taxpayers involved in domestic controlled transactions where the prices between associated parties are inconsistent with the arm's length standard.
- 3.3 The Guidelines shall also apply to transactions between persons who are both  assessable  and  chargeable  to  tax  in the United  Republic  of Tanzania.
- 3.4 The Guidelines are also applicable by analogy, in relation to transactions between  a  permanent  establishment  (PE)  and  its  head  office  or  other related  branches.  For  the  purpose  of  the  Guidelines,  the  PE  will  be treated as a (hypothetically) distinct and separate enterprise from its head office or other related branches

## 4.0 DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGIES

The words used in these guidelines shall have the following meanings:-

' associate '  in  relation  to  a  person  means  another  person  where  the relationship between the two is:-

- (a) that of an individual and a relative of the individual, unless the Commissioner is  satisfied  that  it  is  not  reasonable  to  expect  that either  individual  will  act  in  accordance  with  the  intentions  of  the other;
- (b) that of partners in the same partnership, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that it is not reasonable to expect that either person will act in accordance with the intentions of the other;
- (c) that of an entity and-
- (i). a person who-
- (aa) either  alone  or  together  with  an  associate  or  associates under another application of this definitions; and

- (ii). Under another application of this definitions, is associate of a person to whom subparagraph (i) applies; or

- (d). In  any  case  not  covered  by  paragraphs  (a)  to  (c),  such  that  one may reasonably be expected to act, other than as employee, in accordance with the intentions of the other;

' arrangement ' includes an action, agreement, course of conduct, dealing, promise,  transaction,  understanding  or  undertaking  whether  express  or implied,  whether  or  not  enforceable  by  legal  proceedings  and  whether unilateral or involving more than one person;

' controlled foreign trust '  and ' controlled foreign corporation '  means a  non-resident  trust  or  corporation  in  which  a  resident  person  owns  a membership  interest,  whether  directly  or  indirectly  through  one  or  more interposed non-resident entities, and where-

- (a) the person is associated with the trust or corporation; or
- (b) there exist between one and four other resident persons which, if associated with the person, would cause the person to be associated with the trust or corporation;

' controlled transactions '  transactions between two enterprises that are associated enterprises  with respect to each other;

' uncontrolled  transactions '  transactions  between  enterprises  that  are independent with respect to each other.

## 5.0 POSITION OF THE LAW

## 5.1 The Income Tax Act, Cap.332

Section  33  of  the  Act  is  intended  to  counter  transfer  pricing  practices which may have adverse tax implications for the Tanzania's fiscus.  The measures to combat transfer pricing schemes are in essence contained in section  33  (1)  which  states  that  'in  any  arrangement  between  persons who  are  associates  the  persons  shall  quantify,  apportion  and  allocate amounts  to  be  included  or  deducted  in  calculating  income  between  the persons  as  is  necessary  to  reflect  the  total  income  or  tax  payable  that would  have  arisen  for  them  if  the  arrangement  had  been  conducted  at arm's length'.

Section 33 (2) empowers the Commissioner to make adjustments Consistent where a person has failed to comply with the provisions of subsection (1)

In so doing the Commissioner may:-

- (a) Re- characterize the sources and type of any income, loss amount or payment; or
- (b) Apportion and allocate expenditure including that referred to in  section  71  (2)  incurred  by  one  person  in  conducting  a business  to  the  person  and  the  associate  based  on  the comparative turnover of the businesses.  Here it should be noted  that  the  Commissioner  may  either  act  on  (a),  (b)  or both.

## 5.2 Income Tax Regulation, 2004.

Regulation 6 of the Income tax regulations, 2004 empowers the Commissioner to prepare transfer pricing guidelines.

Regulation 33 of the Income tax regulations 2004 empowers  the Commissioner to enter into  agreement  with  person  as  to  the  manner  in which an arm's length price shall be determined.

## 6.0 THE ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE

## 6.1 Meaning

The  arm's  length  principle  which  is  an  internationally  accepted  and preferred basis for determining the transfer price of a transaction between associated persons, will be the basis adopted by the Tanzania Revenue Authority.  According  to  the  arm's  length  principle,  a  transfer  price  is acceptable if all transactions between associated parties are conducted at arm's length price. Arm's length price is the price which would have been

determined if such transactions were made between independent entities under the same or similar circumstances.

The  arm's  length  principle  is  stated  in  paragraph  1  of  Article  9  of  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing guidelines as follows:-

'(where) conditions are made or imposed between two (associated) enterprises  in  their  commercial  or  financial  relations  which  differ from  those  which  would  have  been  made  between  independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have  accrued  to  one  of  the  enterprises,  but  by  reason  of  those condition have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly '.

## 6.2  Application

In essence, the application of the arm's length principle:

- (i)  treats  associated persons not dealing at arm's length as if they operate as separate entities rather than as inseparable parts of a single unified business; and
- (ii) is generally based on a comparison of:
- a.  prices,  margins,  division  of  profits  or  other  indicators  of controlled transactions; with
- b.  prices,  margins,  division  of  profits  or  other  indicators  of uncontrolled transactions.

## 7.0 DETERMINATION OF ARM'S LENGTH PRICE

The determination of an arm's length price involves the following steps:-

## 7.1 Analysis of transactions and functions

Functional analysis is an understanding of the related party transactions, business  operations,  functions  performed,  assets  employed  and  risks assumed to determine the characterization of the taxpayer's business.

## 7.1.1  Details  of  functions  performed,  Risks  Assumed  and  Assets Employed.

A functional analysis is a crucial process in determining an arm's length price  as  it  forms  the  basis  for  identifying  comparables.  It  involves  the determination of how functions, assets (including intangible property) and risks in a  business  are  divided  up  between  parties  involved  in  the transactions  under  review.  Thus,  a  functional  analysis  serves  three important purposes:

- (i)  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  organization  and  its  business operations;

(ii)  to  identify  the  functions  performed,  risks  assumed  and  assets employed by both the associated and independent persons, and (iii) to assess important and economically significant functions, risks and  assets  undertaken  by  both  the  associated  and  independent persons.

## (a) Functions Performed

Functions are activities performed by each person in business transactions such as procurement, marketing, distribution and sales. The principal functions performed by the associated person under examination should be identified first. Any increase in economically significant functions performed  should  be  compensated  by  an  increase  in  profitability  of  the person.

Usually, when various functions are performed by a group of independent persons, the party that provides the most effort and, more particularly, the rare  or  unique  functions  would  earn  the  most  profit.  For  example,  a distributor  performing  additional  marketing  and  advertising  function  is expected  to  have  a  higher  return  from  the  activity  than  if  it  did  not undertake these functions.

It is thus relevant to consider the relative importance of each function in a functional  analysis.  The  sheer  number  of  functions  performed  by  a particular member of a multinational group does not necessarily mean that it  should  derive  the  greater  share  of  the  profit.  A  party  performing  the most, or more, economically significant functions of the group's operations, albeit fewer functions relative to the other associated person, should be entitled to the greater share of the profit.

## (b) Assets Employed

In  comparing  functions  performed,  it  is  also  important  to  identify  and consider the assets (tangible and intangible) that are employed, or are to be  employed,  in  a  transaction.  This  includes  the  analysis  of  the  type  of assets used (e.g. plant and equipment and valuable intangibles) and the nature  of  the  assets  used  (e.g.  the  age,  market  value,  location,  and property right protections available).

## i. Tangible assets employed

Tangible  assets  such  as  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  usually expected to earn long-term returns that commensurate with the business risks  assumed.  Profitability  of  a  company  should  rightfully  increase  with the increase in the amount, as well as the degree, of specificity of assets employed. Quantifying these amounts whenever possible helps to determine the level of risks borne and the level of profit a company should expect.

## ii. Intangible assets employed

Intangible assets are also expected to generate returns for the owners by way of sales or licensing. It is thus essential to identify the parties to whom the returns generated are attributable.

## (c) Risks Assumed

Evaluation of risks assumed is crucial in determining arm's length prices with  the  economic  assumption  that  the  higher  the  risks  assumed,  the higher the expected return. Controlled and uncontrolled transactions are not comparable if there are significant differences in the risks assumed, for which appropriate adjustments cannot be made.

## (i) Types of risks include :

-  Operational  risk  (including  risks  for  manufacturing  liability, systems failure, reliability of suppliers, inventory and carrying costs, environmental and other regulatory risks);
-  Market risk (including industrial risks, country political risks, reliability of customers and fluctuation in demand  and prices);
-  Product  risk  (including  product  liability  risk,  warranty  risk  / costs and contract enforceability);
-  Business risks related to ownership of assets or facilities;
-  Financial  risk  (including  currency,  commodity,  interest  rate and funding risks);
-  Credit and debt collection risks (including delay or default in payment  of  trade  receivables,  default  on  guaranties,  loans and other receivables); and
-  Risks  of  the  success  or  failure  of  investments  in  research and development.

## (ii) Allocation of risks

The allocation of risks between associated persons should be based on functions  performed.  A  functional  analysis  helps  identify  important  risks, as  well  as  differentiate  between  the  party  which  bears  and  controls  the risks  in  the  legal  contractual  terms  and  the  party  which  bears  the  risks based on the economic substance of the transaction.

In  an  open  market  the  assumption  is  that,  an  increased  risk  will  be compensated by an increase in the expected return. However, this does not always mean that the actual return must necessarily also be higher, as it also depends on the degree to which the risk is actually realized.

## (iii) Consistency of risk allocation with economic substance

Allocation of risks must also be consistent with the economic substance of a  transaction.  The  best  evidence,  in  determining  whether  a  purported allocation of risks is consistent with the economic  substance  of  a transaction, is in the parties' conduct.

An additional factor to consider in examining the economic substance of a purported  risk  allocation  is  the  consequence  of  such  an  allocation  in  an arm's  length  transaction.  In  an  arm's  length  dealing,  it  generally  makes more commercial sense for one party to be allocated a greater share of those risks over which they have relatively more control and from which they can insulate themselves less costly than the other party.

## 7.2 Characterization of business

Characterization is an important element in the steps towards determining the  arm's  length  price  of  a  controlled  transaction.  The  most  common characterizations, based on the nature of activity as well as the complexity of the operations, are:

- (i) Manufacturing: full-fledged, licensed, contract or toll;
- (ii) Distribution: full-fledged, limited risk;
- (iii) Service provider

## 7.3 Identification of comparable transactions

As part of the exercise of establishing an arm's length price, it is important to  decide  the  level  at  which  transactions  are  compared.  The  level  of transaction  is  determined  based  on  what  is  being  used  to  compare, whether:

- (i) To compare a single transaction (e.g. the sale price and terms of sale of particular product);
- (ii) To compare a bundle of transactions;
- (iii) To compare results at gross margin level;
- (iv) To compare results at net margin level; or
- (v) To compare results by reference to some other measures, such as return on capital, ratio of costs to gross margin, etc.

The most appropriate comparables should be selected in adherence to the five factors of comparability discussed in paragraph 10 below.

## 7.4 Tested Party

The determination of a controlled transactions leads to the determination of the tested party. As a general rule, the tested party is the one to which a transfer pricing method can be applied in the most reliable manner and for which  the  most  reliable  comparables  can  be  found.  In  the  Tanzanian scenario,  the  TRA  gives  priority  to  the  availability  of sufficient and verifiable information on both tested party and comparables. As such, TRA does  not  accept  foreign  tested  parties  where  information  is  neither sufficient nor verifiable.

## 7.5 Selection  and  application  of  Transfer  Pricing  Methodologies (TPM)

The Transfer Pricing Regulations have prescribed for specific methods to be used in arriving at the arm's length price as discussed in section 11 of the Guidelines.

## 7.6 Profit Level Indicator (PLI)

In applying the TPM, due consideration must also be given to the choice of  PLI  which  measures the relationship between profits and sales, costs incurred  or  assets  employed.  The  use  of  an  appropriate  PLI  ensures greater  accuracy  in  determining  the  arm's  length  price  of  a  controlled transaction. PLI is presented in the form of a ratio i.e. financial ratios or return  on  capital  employed.  Just  as  in  the  selection  of  transfer  pricing methods,  the  choice  of  an  appropriate  PLI  depends  on  several  factors, including:

- (i) Characterization of the business;
- (ii) Availability of reliable comparable data; and
- (iii) The  extent  to  which  the  PLI  is  likely  to  produce  a  reliable measure of arm's length profit.

Some of the more commonly used PLI include:

- (i) Return on costs: cost plus margin and net cost plus margin.
- (ii) Return on sales: gross margin and operating margin.
- (iii) Return on capital employed: return on operating assets.

## 8.0 COMPARABILITY ANALYSIS

In applying the transfer pricing methods that conform to the arm's length principle, comparability analysis is an important pre-requisite. This involves comparing conditions in a controlled transaction with the condition in transactions between independent enterprises.

## 8.1 Controlled and Uncontrolled Transaction

Controlled  transaction  in  a  comparability  analysis  is  the  transaction  that has  been  identified  as  the  transaction  where  pricing  may  not  be  arm's length. An uncontrolled transaction may be:

- (a)  a  transaction  between  the  tested  party  and  an  independent party  conducted  under  terms  and  circumstances  similar  to  the controlled transaction (internal comparable); or
- (b)  a  transaction  between  two  independent  parties  under  similar terms and circumstances (external comparable).

## 8.2 Factors of Comparability

Basically,  there  are  five  factors  governing  comparability  of  uncontrolled transaction against controlled. Uncontrolled transaction is deemed comparable with that of a controlled transaction if the following five factors are sufficiently similar in both situations:

- and
- (iii)  in  the  case of intangible property: the form of transaction (e.g. licensing or sale); type of property (e.g. patent, trademark or know how);  the  duration  and  degree  of  protection;  and  the  anticipated benefits from the use of property.

## 9.2  Details  of  functions  performed,  Risks  Assumed  and  Assets Employed. (Refer paragraph 8.1.1 above for details)

## 9 3 Contractual terms .

In determining the comparability of a controlled and uncontrolled transaction contractual terms are relevant as they may influence the price or margin of a transaction. Allocation of responsibilities, risks and benefits between  enterprises  are  normally  defined  in  a  contract  agreement.  Any

- (a) Characteristics of the property or services;
- (b)  Functions  performed,  assets  employed  and  risks  assumed  by the respective persons;
- (c) Contractual terms;
- (d) Economic circumstances; and
- (e) Business strategies.

## 8.3 Conditions of Comparability

For  the  purpose  of  comparability,  the  following  conditions  must  be  met where  there  are  differences  between  an  uncontrolled  transaction  and  a controlled transaction:

- (a) none of the differences between the transactions being compared or between the enterprises undertaking those transactions could materially affect the margins in an open market; or
- (b) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material effects of such differences.

## 9.0 FACTORS DETERMINING COMPARABILITY

## 9.1 Characteristics of Property or Services

Characteristics  similarity  of  a  product  or  service  is  of  essence  when comparing  prices  rather  than  profit  margins  between  controlled  and uncontrolled transactions. Comparison of product or service characteristics  is  used  to  a  greater  extent  in  the  application  of  the Comparable  Uncontrolled  Price  (CUP)  method  than  any  other  method. Characteristics that are compared should include:

- (i) in the case of tangible property: the physical features, quality and the volume of supply of property;
- (ii)  in  the  provision  of  services:  the  nature  and  extent  of  services;

differences  between  the  contractual  terms  of  the  transactions  being examined would need to be adjusted in determining an arm's length price for the controlled transaction. The terms and conditions in a contract may include:

- (i) The form of consideration charged or paid;
- (ii) Sales or purchase volume;
- (iii) The scope and terms of warranties provided;
- (iv) Rights to updates, revisions or modifications;
- (v) The duration of relevant licenses, contracts or other agreements, and termination or renegotiation rights;
- (vi) Collateral transactions or ongoing business relationships between the buyer and the seller,  including  arrangements  for  the provision of ancillary or subsidiary services; and
- (vii) Terms of credit and payment.

## 9.4 Economic Circumstances

Different economic circumstances may influence variations in arm's length prices. Factors that may affect the price or margin of a transaction include:

- (i) The geographic location of the market;
- (ii) The size of the market;
- (iii) The extent of competition in the markets;
- (iv) The level of supply and demand in the market as a whole and in particular regions;
- (v) Customer purchasing power;
- (vi)  Cost  of  production  including  the  costs  of  land,  labour  and capital, and transport costs;
- (vii) The level of the market (e.g. retail or wholesale);
- (viii) The date and time of transactions;
- (ix) The availability of substitute goods and services; and
- (x) The  extent  of  government  intervention  e.g.  whether  goods compared are price controlled.

## 9.5 Business Strategies

Business  strategies  must  also  be  observed  in  determining  comparability for  transfer  pricing  purpose.  The  strategies  adopted  by  an  enterprise influence the price charged for a product. In a comparability analysis, it is necessary  to  evaluate  whether  an  independent  person  in  the  same circumstances as that of a controlled person would have adopted similar

strategies and if so, what rewards would have been expected. Business strategies that are relevant in determining comparability include innovation and new product development, degree of diversification, market penetration  schemes,  distribution  channel  selection,  market  level  and location.

## 10.0 ACCEPTABLE METHODS OF DETERMINING AN ARM'S LENGTH PRICE

In  determining arm's length transfer prices, there are several acceptable transfer pricing methods.  All the acceptable methods attempt to establish whether  the  conditions  imposed  in  the  commercial  or  financial  relations between  associated  enterprises  are  consistent  with  the  arm's  length principle.

Of the several acceptable transfer pricing methods, five are recommended by the OECD/UN and are adopted by many countries. From  a practical point of view no one method is suitable in every possible situation and the applicability of any particular method depends on the facts and circumstances of the case, the mix of evidence available, and the relative reliability of other methods under consideration.

The following methods are recommended in determining the arm's length price:-

- (a) The Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method
- (b) The Resale Price Method (RP method)
- (c) Cost Plus Method
- (d) Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) method)
- (e) The Profit Split Method

The first three methods are commonly known as 'Traditional Transactional Methods'. Although the taxpayer is given the right to choose any method, the emphasis should be on arriving at an arm's length price. It is advised that  methods  (d)  and  (e),  commonly  referred  to  as  'Transactional  Profit Methods', be used only when traditional transactional methods cannot be reliably applied or exceptionally cannot be applied at all. This will depend heavily on the availability of comparable data. The method that requires the  fewest  adjustments  and  provides  the  most  reliable  measure  of  an arm's length result is preferred by the TRA as this will reduce the scope and nature of future disputes. Therefore, in deciding the most appropriate method, the following must be considered:

- (i) The nature of the controlled transaction, determined by conducting a functional analysis,
- (ii)  The  degree  of  actual  comparability  when  making  comparisons with transactions between independent parties;
- (iii) The  completeness  and  accuracy  of  data  in  respect  of  the uncontrolled transaction;
- (iv) The reliability of any assumptions made; and

- (v) The degree to which the adjustments are affected if the data is inaccurate or the assumptions are incorrect.

Where both the Traditional Transactional Method and Transactional Profit Method cannot be applied at all, the Commissioner General may allow the application of other methods provided the prices arrived at is in accordance with the arm's length principle.

## 10.1 The Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) Method .

The CUP method is the most direct way of ascertaining an arm's length price. It compares the price charged for a property or services transferred in a controlled transaction to the price charged for a property or services transferred in a comparable  uncontrolled  transaction,  in  comparable circumstances. A difference between the two prices may be an indication that the  conditions  of  the  commercial  and  financial  relations  of  the associated  persons  are  not  arm's  length,  and  that  the  price  in  the uncontrolled  transaction  may  need  to  substitute  for  the  price  in  the controlled transaction.

An MNE using the CUP method to determine its transfer price must first identify all the differences between its product and that of an independent person. The MNE must then determine whether these differences have a material effect on the price, and adjust the price of products sold by the independent person to reflect these differences to arrive at an arm's length price.

## Example

A  Tanzania  enterprise  'A',  manufactures  crocodile  leather  shoes  and travel bags.  The shoes are sold to a French subsidiary 'B' which sells the shoes to unconnected exclusive boutiques.  The credit terms to 'B' are 90 days.  Also sells the shoes to two independent distributors 'C' and 'D' in France.    The  credit  terms  to  the  independent  parties  are  30  days.    'C' sells the shoes directly to end-users and 'D' sells the shoes to expensive shoes shops in Oxford and Bond Street in London. 'A' also sells the travel bags to an independent distributor in France.

## Possible application of CUP

The  travel  bags  sold  to  the  independent  distributor  in  France  will  not constitute a CUP because the product is not similar to shoes and the price is not comparable.  The shoes sold to 'C' would also not quality as a CUP because the level of the market is different. 'B' is at a higher level in the distribution  chain  than  C and it is unlikely to be possible to quantify this difference and make reliable adjustments.  The shoes sold to 'D' may be a  valid  CUP  if  the  Paris  and  London  markets  are  comparable.    It  will however,  be  necessary  to  adjust  the  price  for  the  difference  in  credit terms.

## 10.2 Resale Price Method (RPM)

The  Resale  Price  Method  generally  is  most  appropriate  where  the  final transaction is made to an independent distributor. The starting point in the resale  price  method  is  the  price  at  which  a  product  that  has  been purchased from an associated enterprise is then resold to an independent enterprise. This price (the resale price) is then reduced by an appropriate gross margin (the resale price margin) representing an amount from which the reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and in  the  light  of  functions  performed  (taking  into  account  assets  used and  risks  assumed),  make  an  appropriate  profit  between  associated enterprises is obtained after subtracting that gross margin, and adjusting for other costs associated with the purchase of the product (e.g. custom duties). A typical adjustment may be represented as follows:

Arm's  Length  Price  =  Resale  price-(Resale  price  x  Resale  Price Margin)

Where:

- * Resale Price Margin = Sales price-Purchase Price Sales Price
- **  Resale price margin must be comparable to margins earned by other independent enterprises performing similar functions, bearing similar risks and employing similar assets.

## Example

Taxpayer B, a distributor, is  a  Tanzanian subsidiary of multinational A , which is located overseas. B distributes high quality product manufactured by A . A also  sells  similar  product  of  a  lower  quality  to  an  independent distributor C in Tanzania. The cost of product purchased from A by B is Tshs.760 per unit. B resells the product to independent party for Tshs.800. A functional analysis shows that B and C perform similar functions. The gross profit ratio of C was found to be 10%.

In  this  example,  it  is  noted  that  there  are  product  (quality)  differences when  comparing  the  controlled  and  uncontrolled  transactions.  However, since  the  focus  of  comparison  is  on  margins  the  differences  are  not  as material  as  they  would  have  been  if  the  basis  of  comparison  were  on prices. Furthermore, B and C carry out similar functions ( C being another reseller in the same market), thus the resale price margin of 10% will be used  as  a  basis  to  determine  the  arm's  length  price  for  the  original purchase by B from A .

Arm's length price of product purchased (in Tshs) = 800 - (800 X 10%)

= Tshs. 720

## 10.3 The Cost Plus Method

The cost plus method requires estimation of an arm's length consideration, by adding an appropriate mark-up to the costs incurred by the supplier of goods or services in a controlled transaction.  This mark-up should provide for an appropriate profit to the supplier, in the light of the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed. This method is best suited to situations where:

- (a) Services are provided
- (b) Semi-finished goods are sold between related parties,
- (c) Related persons have concluded joint facility agreements or long-term buy-supply arrangements

The mark-up should ideally be determined with reference to the mark-up earned  by  the  same  supplier  in  uncontrolled  transactions.    If  this  is  not possible, the mark-up should be determined by using the mark-up earned in comparable transactions by an independent supplier performing comparable functions, bearing similar risks and employing similar assets to those of the taxpayer.

An uncontrolled transaction is comparable to a controlled transaction for purposes of the costs plus method if one of two conditions is met.

- (i) none of the difference between the transaction being compared  or  between  the  enterprises  undertaking  those transactions  materially  affect  the  cost  plus  mark  up  in  the open market: or
- (ii) reasonably  accurate  adjustment  can  be  made  to  eliminate the material effects of such differences.

Fewer adjustments are needed for product comparability than under the CUP and the same comparability principles as discussed under the resale price method will apply to the cost plus method.

## Example

B , a Tanzania holding company, is responsible for the development of all the software to be used by its subsidiaries in Namibia and Botswana.  It was  clear  from  the  beginning  that  there  was  a  market  for  this  kind  of services  in  Africa. B also  provides  these  services  to  other  customers throughout Africa.  The software and hardware required by each customer are unique and differ from the software developed and hardware supplied to  the  subsidiaries,  but  the  functions  and  processes  to  provide  these services are comparable. An analysis of the income and costs in respect of the services provided to the independent customers indicates that costs are recovered and gross profit of between 22 and 25 per cent is achieved. B should therefore charge its subsidiaries at cost plus between 22 and 25 per cent for the performance of the information technology function.

## 10.4 Transactional Net Margin method (TNMM)

The TNMM examines the net profit margin that a taxpayer realized from a controlled  transaction  relative  to  an  appropriate  base,  for  example  cost, sales or assets.  This ration is referred to as a profit level indicator.  The profit  level  indicator  of  the  tested  party  is  compared  to  the  profit  level indicator(s) of comparable independent parties.

Although  the  TNMM  is  classified  as  a  transactional  profit  method,  it  is more  closely  aligned  to  the  CP  and  RP  method  than  to  the  profit  split method.  TNMM focuses on the functions performed by an enterprise in the same way as the Cost Plus and Resale Plus methods do.  However the  difference  is  that  the  TNMM  compares  net  profit  rather  than  gross profit.  The TNMM is, however, considered less reliable than the traditional transaction methods.

This  is  because  the  net  margins  which  are  used  in  the  TNMM  are  very sensitive to the relative cost structures of the entities being compared, as they include operating efficient distributorship than the independent firm, the  application  of  the  TNMM  would  result  in  a  lower  net  profit  being determined for the distributorship than if the RP method were used.  Thus,

unless an adjustment could be made to reflect the relative efficiency of the firms being compared, use of the TNMM would not provide reliable result.

In  order  to  maximize  the  reliability  of  the  TNMM,  the  member  of  the multinational and the independent firm being compared would need to be structurally similar. In practice, firms are structurally unique and comparisons of indicators between firms will tend to be less reliable than comparisons  made  at  the  gross  margin  level.    For  these  reasons  the TNMM along with the profit split method are considered to be methods of last resort in international practice.

This observation does not preclude the TNMM from being used. It must be recognized that  reliable  information  on  gross  margins  may  be  difficult,  if not  impossible  to  obtain.    Thus  information  constraints  may  dictate  the TNMM as the only practical approach in many cases.

The related party (Tested party) whose profit level will be compared to the profit  level  of  the  independent  parties  will  usually  be  the  party  for  which reliable data on the most  closely comparable  transactions can  be identified.    It  is  usually  the  enterprise  that  is  the  least  complex  and  that does not own valuable intangible property.

## Example

CCP is a manufacturer of dehydrated food.  Its products are distributed to its subsidiaries  through  Europe.    CCP  does  not  sell  to  independent distributors at  all and no comparables could be located that would allow the  application  of  the  CUP,  cost  plus  or  resale  price  methods.  The  only remaining method is thus the TNMM

Research on comparable independent companies resulted in the determination  of  an  arm's  length  range  of  15  to  18  per  cent.    This percentage is determined by expressing operating profit as a percentage of  the  turnover.    After  adjustments  were  made  for  differences  between CCP  and  the  comparable  independent  companies  in  respect  of  stock holding and debtor's days outstanding, the range of arm's length margins is 17.5 to 19 per cent.

The  transfer  price  for  the  sale  of  the  dehydrated  food  from  CCP  to  its subsidiaries should thus be set at a level that will result in operating profit as a percentage of turnovers of between 17.5 and 19 per cent.

## 10.5 The Profit Split Method

The  profit  spilt  method  is  usually  applied  where  transactions  are  so integrated  that  they  cannot  be  evaluated  separately.    Under  similar circumstances,  independent  enterprises  may  decide  to  set  up  a  form  of partnership and agree to some form of profit spilt.

The first step in the profit spilt method is to identify the combined profit to be  split  between  the  associated  parties  in  a  controlled  transaction.    In

general combined operating profit is used, ensuring that both income and expenses  of  the  multinational  are  attributed  to  the  relevant  associated person consistently.

That profit is then split between the parties according to an economically valid  basis  approximating  the  division  of  profits  that  would  have  been anticipated and reflected in an agreement made at arm's length.

Two  alternative  approaches  to  the  profit  spilt  method  are  as  outlined below:

- (a) Residual Profit Split Approach
- (b) Contribution Analysis Approach

Under both approaches, the first step is to determine the combined profit attributable to the parties to the transaction.  The combined profit is then allocated as follows:-

- (i) Under the residual profit split approach, each of the parties to the transaction is assigned a portion of profit according to the  basic  functions  that  it  performs.    The  residual  profit  or loss  is  then  allocated  between  the  parties  on  the  basis  of their relative economic contribution in respect of the amount to be allocated.
- (ii)  Under the contribution analysis approach, it is generally the combined operating profit (profit before interest and tax) that is  divided  between  the  parties  on  the  basis  of  the  relative contribution of each party's combined gross profit.

However,  these  approaches  are  not  necessary  exhaustive  or  mutually exclusive.  There may be other alternative ways to split a profit to achieve a reliable arm's length result.

In  some  circumstance,  it  may  be  appropriate  to  split  gross  profits  (as opposed  to  operating  profits)  between  the  associated  parties  and  then deduct the operating expenses incurred by or attributable to each relevant enterprise.  An  example  is  a  multinational  engaged  in  highly,  integrated word-wide trading operations involving various types of property.  It may be possible to determine the enterprises in which expenses are incurred or attributed, but not to accurately determine  the  particular trading activities  to  which  those  expenses  relate.    In  such  case  it  may  be appropriate  to  spilt  the  gross  profit  from  each  trading  activity  and  then deduct  from  the  resulting  overall  gross  profit  the  operating  expenses incurred by or attributable to each enterprise.

The  allocation  of  gross  profit  should  be  consistent  with  the  location  of activities  and  risks.  Care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  expenses incurred  by  or  attributable  to  each  enterprise  are  consistent  with  the activities performed and risk assumed by the relevant entities.

## 10.5.1 Residual Profit Spilt Analysis

The  residual  profit  split  approach  first  provides  both  the  parties  to  the transaction  with  a  basic  return,  based  on  what  independent  firm  would obtain  for  performing  similar  functions  and  undertaking  similar  risks. Applying other transfer pricing methods, such as a cost plus method or a resale price method, could also achieve this.

The  residual  profit  remaining  after  the  first  stage  division  would  be allocated  among  the  parties,  in  accordance  with  the  way  in  which  this residual would have been divided between independent enterprises. Facts and circumstances that could influence the profit allocation in the second stage include the parties' contributions of intangible property and relative bargaining positions.

This  requires  a  judgment  about  what  factors  contribute  to  the  residual profit, and their relative contribution.  For example, it may be determined that  the  process  development  and  the  marketing  are  the  only  relevant contributors to the residual profit and that each contributes 50 per cent to that profit.  A 50-50 split of the residual profit between the manufacturer and the retailer would then be justified.

## 10.5.2 Contribution Analysis Approach

Under this approach, combined profits would be divided between associated persons based on the relative value of functions (i.e. contribution) performed by each of the associated persons participating in a controlled transaction. To determine the relative value of contribution, it may  be  necessary  to  focus  on  the  nature  and  degree  of  each  party's contribution of differing types (e.g. provision of services, capital invested) and assign a percentage based on the relative comparison and external market data.

Unlike the residual approach, basic returns are not allocated to each party to the transaction before the profit split is made. Generally, the profit to be combined  and  divided is the operating profit. Where  allocation of expenses to controlled transactions is impossible, a split of gross profits may  be  considered,  after  which  expenses  attributable  to  the  relevant enterprises will be deducted accordingly.

However, it is difficult to determine the relative value of contribution that each  of  the  participants  makes  to  the  controlled  transactions,  and  the approach will often depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Thus,  the  approach  requires  careful  judgment  and  the  criteria  should always include what adds value to the transaction and how economically important  were  the  functions  carried  out  by  each  party  in  earning  the profits.

The division of combined profits under the transactional profit split method is achievable by the use of allocation keys. The choice of allocation keys by which profits are split largely depends on the facts and circumstances

that surround a case. An allocation key can be in the form of a figure (e.g. a  percentage)  or  a  variable  (e.g.  specific  expenses).  Some  of  the  more common types of allocation keys are:

Asset-based: useful where the controlled transaction demonstrates strong correlation between assets and the creation of value;

- (a) Cost-based: where there is clear indication of correlation between cost and value created;
- (b) Time spent by employees performing intra-group services;
- (c)  Units produced or sold;
- (d) Number of employees;
- (e) Space used.

## 11.0 PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE

## 11.1 Application of the Law

The arm's length principle is provided for under section 33 of the Tanzania Income Tax Act, Cap.332, which provides:-

'In  any  arrangement  between  persons  who  are  associates,  the  persons shall quantify, apportion and allocate amounts to be included or deducted in calculating income between the persons as is necessary to reflect the total  income  or  tax  payable  that  would  have  arisen  for  them  if  the arrangement had been conducted at arm's length'. Under this provision, the associate is required to do the following:-

- (a) Quantify
- (b) Apportion
- (c) Allocate amounts  to  be  included  or deducted  in calculating income between the people as is necessary to reflect the total income or Tax payable that would have arisen further if the arrangement had been conducted at arm's length.

Under section 33 (2) of the Act, the Commissioner is empowered to adjust transfer prices where the transactions are not at arm's length.

The Commissioner in applying the provisions of section 33 of the Income Tax Act  Cap.332, and regulation 33 of the Income Tax regulations may enter into agreement with a person as to the manner in which an arm's length price should be determined. Failure to abide with the requirement of the  agreement  gives  grounds  for  the  Commissioner  to  determine  the income and allowable deductions by considering the prices and consideration  that  independent  parties  would  have  used  in  comparable transactions with legal entities residing in Tanzania or abroad.

## 11.2 Issues to consider in Transfer pricing Adjustment

In making  comparability  analysis  for  transfer  pricing  adjustment,  the commissioner may consider the following:

## (a) Comparable Period

It is an obligation of every taxpayer to determine his transfer pricing for tax purposes  in  accordance  with  the  arm's  length  principle,  based  upon information reasonably available at the time of the determination. Therefore, the arm's length price should be determined by comparing the results of a controlled transaction with the results of uncontrolled transactions that were undertaken or carried out during the same year as the year of the taxpayer's controlled transaction.

Such requirement is made based on the fact that arm's length principle must  be  complied  with  contemporaneously,  on  a  year  by  year  basis.  A contemporaneous uncontrolled transaction should provide the most reliable comparable as it is carried out in an economic environment that is the  same  as  or  similar  to  the  economic  environment  of  the  taxpayer's controlled transaction.

There  may  be  cases  where  data  in  a  particular  financial  year  does  not provide the most reliable comparison, depending on the industry concerned  and  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  For  instance,  if  a  tested party's accounting period ends at 31 March, data from a company in the same industry with a financial year end at 31 December is considered a better  comparable  to  another  company  with  financial  year  end  at  31 December. This is  because the  economic  environment for  the  company with  year  ending  31  December  would  be  more  relevant  to  that  of  the tested party.

## (b) Multiple Year Data

Multiple year data is analyzed in order to identify whether the outcome of a particular year is influenced by abnormal factors. However, the use of multiple year data does not imply the use of multiple year average.

For  the  purpose  of  gaining  a  complete  understanding  of  the  facts  and circumstances  surrounding  a  controlled  transaction,  it  is  useful  to  examine data from both the years after the year under examination and prior years. The use of data from past years will show whether a taxpayer's reported loss on a transaction is part of a history of losses on similar transactions, a result of a particular economic condition in a prior year that caused an increase in cost in the subsequent year, or a reflection of the fact that a product is at the end of its life cycle.

## (c) Arm's Length Range

An arm's length range refers to a range of figures that are acceptable in establishing the arm's length nature of a controlled transaction. The range

is  derived  from  applying  the  same  transfer  pricing  method  to  multiple comparable  data.  It  is  established  that  transfer  pricing  is  not  an  exact science, and that the application of the most appropriate  transfer pricing methodology may produce a range of results. The facts and circumstances of a case are therefore important in determining a range, or the point in a range, that is the most reliable estimate of an arm's length price or allocation.

The arm's length range should be made using only comparable uncontrolled transactions that have, or have been adjusted to, a high level of  reliability  in  comparison  to  the  controlled  transactions.  A  substantial deviation  among  points  or  between  the  data  in  the  range  (e.g.  upper quartile  and  lower  quartile)  may  indicate  that  comparables  used  are  not reliable, and that material differences exist in terms of Functions performed,  Assets  employed  and  Risks  assumed  (FAR)  which  warrant comparability  adjustments.  In  such  cases,  the  reliability  of  comparable data must be carefully assessed, and adjustments made for the material differences  in  comparability  analysis  and  the  methodology  should  be reviewed.

If every effort has been made to exclude data that have a lesser degree of comparability,  but  some  comparability  defects  remain  and  cannot  be adjusted, it may be appropriate to make transfer pricing adjustments to a value  that  best  reflects  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  transactions between  associated  persons.  This  value  may  be  derived  from  utilising statistical tools depending on the specific characteristic of the data set.

## (d) Separate and Combined Transactions

The arm's length principle should preferably be applied on a transactionby-transaction basis, in order to obtain the most precise approximation of an  arm's  length  price  or  profit  allocation.  However,  depending  on  the circumstances  of  the  case,  transfer  pricing  may  sometimes  need  to  be dealt with at the level of a product line or business unit rather than at the level of each particular transaction.

When establishing transfer prices, taxpayers should set prices separately for each transaction they enter into with an associated person. However, where transactions are so closely linked (or continuous) that they cannot be  evaluated  adequately  on  a  separate  basis,  determination  of  transfer price based on bundled transactions may be considered, provided it can be demonstrated that it is the normal industry practice to set one price for a  combination  of  transactions  (e.g.  goods  and  the  associated  intangible property) or where it may not be reasonable to expect to find quality data available to set the price for separate transactions. Lack of reliable data on comparable transactions may be due to the complexity of the dealings or the relationships between the parties. Therefore, the total amount may be on an aggregate basis.

## (e) Re-Characterization of Transactions

Controlled transaction ordinarily should  be  examined  based  on  the transaction actually undertaken by the taxpayer insofar as are consistent with the methods described in the Guidelines. However, when reviewing an agreement between associated persons, consideration is not only on the terms of the agreement but also the actual conduct of the parties.

The  Commissioner in  determining  an  arm's  length  price  may  disregard and re-characterize a controlled transaction under the following circumstances:

- (i)  where  the  economic  substance  of  a  transaction  differs from  its form; or
- (ii)  where  the  form  and  substance  of  a  transaction  are  the  same; the arrangements made in relation to the transaction, when viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by independent  persons  behaving  in  commercially  rational  manner and  this  actual  structure  practically  impedes  the  Commissioner from determining an appropriate transfer price.

The  rationale  towards  re-characterizing  a  transaction  is  based  on  the character  of  the  transaction  derived  from  the  relationship  between  the parties,  and  is  not  determined  by  normal  commercial  conditions.  The controlled transaction may have been structured by the taxpayer to avoid or minimize tax. This is supported by the fact that: -

-  associated  persons  are  able  to  enter  into  a  greater  variety  of contracts and agreements  compared  to independent persons because  the normal conflict of interest which exist between independent parties is often absent;
-  associated  persons  often  conclude  arrangements  of  a  specific nature that are not, or very rarely, encountered between independent persons; and
-  contracts  under  a  controlled  transaction  are  quite  easily  altered, suspended,  extended, or terminated according to the overall strategies of the multinational group as a whole and such alteration may even be made retroactively.

## Example

An investment in an associated enterprise in the form of interest-bearing debt would not be expected to be structured in the same way had it been conducted  at  arm's  length,  given  the  economic  circumstances  of  the borrowing  company.  In  this  case,  it  might  be  appropriate  for  a  tax administration  to  characterize  the  investment  in  accordance  with  its economic  substance  where  the  loan  may  be  treated  as  subscription  of capital.

## Example

A  sale  under  a  long  term  contract,  for  a  lump  sum  payment,  gives unlimited entitlement to the intellectual property rights arising as a result of future  research  for  the  term  of  the  contract.  While  it  may  be  proper  to respect  the  transaction  as  a  transfer  of  commercial  property  it  would nevertheless be appropriate for the Commissioner to confirm the terms of that  transfer  in  its  entirety  to  that  which  might  reasonably  have  been

expected  between  independent  persons.  Thus,  in  the  case  described above,  it  might  be  appropriate  for  the  Commissioner,  for  example,  to adjust the conditions of the agreement in a commercially rational manner as a continuing research agreement.

## (f) Transfer Pricing Adjustment

The  Commissioner may  make  an  adjustment  to  reflect  the  arm's  length price  or  interest  rate  for  that  transaction  by  substituting  or  imputing  the price, or interest where he found that a price in a controlled transaction is not at arm's length, as the case may be. In such instances, the adjustment will also be reflected by a corresponding adjustment upon request of the other party of the controlled transaction. Adjustments will be made where:

- (i)  For the supply of property or services, the consideration is less than the consideration that would have been received or receivable in an arm's length arrangement;
- (ii)  For  the acquisition of property or services, the consideration is more than the consideration that would have been given or agreed to be given in an arm's length arrangement; or
- (iii)  No  consideration  has  been  charged  to  the  associated  person for the supply of property or services.

## (g) Losses

Losses  incurred  by  enterprises  for  a  variety  of  economic  and  business reasons  such  as  start  up  losses,  market  penetration  strategies,  and research  and  development  failure.  However,  an  independent  enterprise would not endure continuous losses without taking appropriate measures to  correct  the  situation  within  reasonable  time,  as  it  would  contradict fundamental  business  objectives  of  making  profits.  The  fact  that  an associated  enterprise  continuously  suffers  losses  may  be  an  indication that it is not being compensated fairly or it is paying excess amounts for goods and services to associated parties.

It  is  important  to  ensure  that  the  controlled  transaction  entered  into  is commercially realistic and make economic sense in determining whether the  losses  are  acceptable.  A  taxpayer  needs  also  to  establish  that  the losses are commercial in nature within the context of its characterization. In  this  regard,  a  taxpayer  is  expected  to  maintain  contemporaneous documentation  which  outlines  the  non-transfer  pricing  factors  that  have contributed to the losses.

A contract or toll manufacturer that only carries out production as ordered by  a  related  party,  without  performing  functions  such  as  operational strategy setting, product research and development and sales, is expected to  maintain  a  consistent  level  of  profitability.  Should  the  manufacturer suffer from losses, it must prove that these losses are not a result of its transactions with a related party.

## 11.3 Tax Treaties

Countries have a number of bilateral tax treaties with other countries that address, inter-alia ,  transfer  pricing  issues.  One  reason  for  signing  such treaties  is  to  eliminate  the  double  taxation  and  fiscal  evasion  that  often results from the allocation of tax revenues from international transactions. Section  128  (1) of the Income  Tax  Act,  Cap.332  recognizes  such international agreements and that they supersede domestic law with the exception of conditions stated under subsection 5 and sub division B of Division II part III of the Act.

If a transfer pricing adjustment has been  made  by  a  foreign tax administration  that  results  in  double  taxation,  a  taxpayer  may  request competent authority consideration under the Mutual Agreement Procedure Article  in  Tanzania's  tax  treaties.    This  could  result  in  a  corresponding adjustment being allowed in Tanzania or the Tanzania competent Authority taking up the issue of appropriate arm's length pricing with the foreign administration.

## 11.4 Documentation requirements

As a general rule, the taxpayer is required to keep sufficient records as provided for under Section 80 of the Income Tax Act, Cap.332 to enable the Commissioner to ascertain income or loss from the business. Details of documentation for the purpose of Transfer pricing are explained under paragraph 13.

## 12.0 DOCUMENTATION

## 12.1 Legislation

Sections 80, 139 and 140 of the Income Tax Act, Cap.332 deal with the information  and  documents  required  to  be  kept  by  a  taxpayer  and  the access the Commissioner has to such information and documents, as well as the documentation required to explain information to be provided in a tax  return  or  any  other  document  to  be  filed  with  the  Commissioner. These  provisions  are  also  applicable  to  transfer  pricing  documentation requirements.

## 12.2 Documentation Requirements

All  records  as  well  as  recorded  details  from  which  the  taxpayer's  tax returns were prepared, are to be retained for a period of five years from the  end  of  the  year  of  income  or  years  of  income  to  which  they  are relevant unless the Commissioner otherwise specifies by notice in writing.

Section 139 empowers the Commissioner, for the purpose of obtaining full information in respect of the income of a taxpayer or any part thereof, to require  the  taxpayer  or  any  other  person  to  produce  for  examination  at such time and place as may be determined by the Commissioner.

Documents pertaining  to  transfer  pricing  are  not  to  be  submitted  at  the time  of  filing  income  tax  returns  but  should  be  made  available  to  the Commissioner upon request.

The Commissioner may, by service of a notice in writing require a person; whether or not liable for tax under the Act to retain documents described with reasonable certainty in the notice for such period as may be specified in the notice.

## 12.3 Maintaining Records

Section 80 requires that, unless otherwise authorized by the Commissioner in writing, every taxpayer shall maintain tax documents in the United Republic of Tanzania and in an official language of the United Republic of Tanzania.  The official languages of Tanzania are English and Kiswahili.

Where  the  documents  are  not  in  an  official  language  of  the  United Republic of Tanzania, the Commissioner may require the person to have these documents translated by a translator approved by the Commissioner.

An analysis under the arm's length principle generally requires information about  the  associated  enterprises  involved  in  the  controlled  transactions, the  transactions  at  issue,  the  functions  performed,  the  risks  borne,  the assets  employed  and  information  derived  from  independent  enterprises engaged in similar transactions or business.

Additional information could include the nature and terms of the transaction, economic conditions and property involved in the transactions,  how  the  product  or  service  that  is  the  subject  of  the controlled transaction in question flows among associates and changes in trading conditions or renegotiations of existing arrangements.

-  Areas of particular expertise;
-  Job description and duties;
-  Remuneration;
-  Written  statements  provided  by  key  staff  and  used  by taxpayer in determining the functions, risks and asset of the company;
- (vii) Other relevant documents.

## 12.5 Acceptability of Documentation

To  ensure  the  acceptability  of  the  contemporaneous  transfer  pricing documentation, reasonable efforts should be given to:

- (a)  Undertake a transfer pricing analysis to ascertain that transfer prices comply with the arm's length principle and reflect commercially realistic outcomes for all controlled transactions.
- (b)  Maintain  documents  that  are  applicable  to  the  circumstances and be prepared to provide additional information or documentation not contained above, but which may be relevant for the determination of the arm's length price.
- (c) Prepare the documentation in accordance to the Rules and The Guidelines.
- (d) Implement and review the arm's length transfer pricing policies and  redesign  the  transfer  pricing  policy  to  accommodate  any changes in the business environment.
- (e) Prevent from providing vague, useless or inadequately founded information.
- (f) Apply a coherent  and  transparent approach  in identifying uncontrolled transactions.
- (g)  Provide  detailed  analysis  of  functions,  assets,  risks,  market conditions and business strategies.

- (k) Highlight  and  document  any  specific  event  that  may  have hindered  the  MNE's  performance  so  that  appropriate  fact-based adjustments can be considered.
- (l) Maintain  adequate  background  documents  and  full  records containing  particulars  about  the  factual  assumptions  and  relevant factors that have been taken into account in working out the arm's length price.
- (m)  Avoid  documentation  which  is  not  properly  supporting  the transactions, limited, and incomplete.

## 13.0 SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR INTANGIBLE PROPERTY

## 13.1 Intangible Properties

These  are  unique  products  valued  for  their  intellectual  or  intangible contents  which  can be  legally  or  not  legally  protected.  Categorization  of these properties can be made into two broad types:

- (a)  Trade  intangibles  such  as  patents  created  through  risky  and costly  research  and  development  know-how,  designs  and  models that are used in producing a product or in providing a service; and
- (b)  Marketing intangibles i.e. trademarks and trade name that are used in the exploitation of the products, customer lists, distribution channel and so forth.

## 13.2 Existence of Intangible Properties

It is essential  to  first  determine  the  existence  of  the  property  when considering  the  issue  of  intangible  properties,  i.e.  by  looking  into  the benefit  derived  from  the  intangible.  When  a  company  demonstrates  a higher than average rate of return on assets or higher than average profits for a given level of physical assets over a period of time, it indicates the likely presence of intangibles. Intangible for the purpose of these guidelines is intended to address something which is not a physical asset or a financial asset and which is capable of being owned or controlled for use in commercial activities. Intangibles that are important to consider for transfer pricing purposes are not always recognized as intangible assets for  accounting purposes. For example, costs associated with developing intangibles internally through expenditures such as research and development and advertising are sometimes  expensed rather than capitalized  for  accounting  purposes  and  the  intangibles  resulting  from such  expenditures  therefore  are  not  always  reflected  on  the  balance sheet.  Such  intangibles  may  carry  significant  economic  value  and  may need to be considered for transfer pricing purposes.

Basically,  the  arm's  length  principle  applies  to  intangible  property  in  the same  way  as  for  any  other  type  of  property,  however,  the  treatment  of intangible property can be one of the most difficult areas to apply correctly in  transfer  pricing  practice,  due  to  the  fact  that  the  transaction  may represent a number of components, both tangible and intangible, bundled together  to  form  a  single  product.    The  property  may  have  a  special character complicating the search for comparable and also due to the fact that MNE may, for entirely commercial reasons, structure their transaction in a way that would not be adopted by independent firms.

In  applying the arm's length principle to controlled transactions involving intangible property, some special factors relevant to comparability between the controlled and uncontrolled transaction should be considered. These factors include ;

- (a) The  expected  benefits  from  the  intangible  property  (possibly determined through a net present value calculator);
- (b) Any limitations on the geographic area in which rights may be exercised;
- (c) Export  restrictions  on  goods  produced  by  virtue  of  any  rights transferred;
- (d) the exclusive or non-exclusive character of any rights transferred;
- (e) the capital investment ( to construct new plants or to buy special machines);
- (f)  The start - up expenses and the development work required in the market;
- (g) The possibility of sub-licensing the licensee's distribution network and whether the license has the right to participate in further developments of the property by the licensor.

The Commissioner therefore considers the guidance provided in chapter VI of the OECD  Guidelines  which  deals  specifically  with  intangible property  highly  relevant  and  recommends  that  taxpayers  and  officers follow the guidance provided therein in establishing arm's length conditions in agreements with associates involving intangible property.

## 14.0 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTRA GROUP SERVICES

MNE groups arrange for a wide scope of services to be available to its members, in particular administrative, technical and commercial services. Such services may  include management, coordination and control functions for the whole group.  The cost of providing such services may be borne initially by the parent, by a specially designated group member ('a group services center' or by another group member.

The main issues in the analysis of transfer pricing for intra-group services are:

- (a) Whether intra - group services have in fact been provided
- (b) Whether the intra-group charge  for such  services for tax purposes are at arm's length prices.

The  following  factors  should  serve  as  a  guide  in  determining  whether services have been rendered:

- (i)  Whether  the  activity  provides  a  respective  group  member  with economic or commercial value to enhance its commercial position and whether an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances  would  be  willing  to  pay  or  perform  in-house  for  its services
- (ii)  If  the  activity  is  not  one for which the independent would have been willing to pay or perform for itself, the activity ordinarily should not  be  considered  as  an  intra  -  group  services  under  the  arm's length principle
- (iii) In  general,  no  intra  -  group  services  should  be  found  for activities undertaken by one group member that merely duplicate a service that another group member is performing for itself; or that is being performed for such other group member by a third party
- (iv) An  associated enterprise should not be considered to receive an  intra -group  services when  it obtains incidental attributable  solely  to  its  being  part  of  a  large  concern,  and  not  to any specific activity being performed.
- (v) Passive  association  should  be  distinguished  from  active promotion  of  the  MNE  group's  attributes  that  positively  enhances the  profit  -  making  potential  of  particular  members  of  the  group. Each  case  must  be  determined  according  to  its  own  facts  and circumstances
- (vi) The method to be used to determine arm's length transfer pricing for intra - group services should be determined according to these guidelines, often, the application of these guidelines will lead to  use  of  the  CUP  or  Cost  Plus  Method  for  pricing  intra  -  group services.

## 15.0 INTRA GROUP FINANCING

## 15.1 Financial assistance between associated persons

Among the services between associated persons is intra-group financing. This may be in the form of financial assistance for business purposes that includes  loans,  interest  bearing  trade  credits,  advance  or  debt  and  the provision of any security or guarantee. The financial assistance arrangements  between  associated  persons  can  arise  from  the  following situations:

- (a) Where  a  taxpayer,  directly  or  indirectly,  acquires  from  or supplies to an associated person financial assistance for a consideration; or

- (b)  Where  a  taxpayer  supplies  financial  assistance  directly  or indirectly to an associated person without consideration.

In both situations, the taxpayer should charge or pay the associated person interest at a rate which is consistent with the rate that would have  been  charged  in  a  similar  transaction  between  independent persons dealing at arm's length.

## 15.2 Substitution and Imputation of Arm's length Interest

Where  the  interest  rate  imposed  or  would  have  been  imposed  on  a controlled  financial  assistance  is  not  at  arm's  length,  the  Commissioner may make an adjustment to reflect the arm's length interest rate or impute interest  on  the  controlled financial assistance. Adjustments will be made where:

- (a) For the supply of financial assistance, the consideration is less than the consideration that would have been received or receivable in an arm's length arrangement;
- (b) For the acquisition of financial assistance, the consideration is more than the consideration that would have been given or agreed to be given in an arm's length arrangement; or
- (c) No consideration has been charged to the associated person for the supply of the financial assistance.

## 15.3 Determination of Arm's Length Interest

An arm's length interest  rate  is  an  interest  rate  charged,  or  would  have been  charged,  at  the  time  the  financial  assistance  was  granted  in uncontrolled transactions with or between independent persons.

In  determining  an  arm's  length  interest  rate  for  financial  assistance,  the comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method is considered to provide the most  reliable  measure.  In  this  context,  the  CUP  method  determines  an arm's length interest rate by reference to interest rates between independent  parties  on  loan  with  highly  similar  terms  and  conditions. Where differences exist,  adjustments  should  be  done  to eliminate  these differences.

## 15.4 Comparability Factors

There are comparability factors that should be considered when searching for  and  analyzing  financial  transactions  and  in  determining  arm's  length interest. These include:

- (a) The nature and purpose of the financial assistance;
- (b) The amount, duration and terms of the financial assistance;
- (c) The type of interest rate (eg: fixed or floating interest rate);
- (d) Embedded options;
- (e) Guarantees involved in the financial assistance;
- (f) Collateral for the financial assistance;

- (g) Creditworthiness of the borrower;
- (h) Location of the lender and borrower.

When ascertaining the arm's length interest rate, appropriate indices such as London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or specific rates quoted by banks for comparable loans can be used as a reference point. Adjustments are then made on the rates used as reference point based on the outcome of comparability analysis to arrive at the arm's length interest rate.

## 15.5 Documenting Financial Assistance Pricing Policy

Taxpayers are required to substantiate and document that, the terms of an intercompany  financial  assistance,  specifically  the  interest  rate  applied, are at arm's length. This encompasses preparation of an analysis on the setting  of  the  correct  level  of  underlying  interest  and  documentation  on other factors of comparability such as loan structure, etc. Taxpayers also need to review existing inter-company agreement on a periodic basis to ensure that all the terms and conditions of the loan remain at arm's length.

## 16.0 INTEREST AND PENALTIES

Penalties  are  generally  designed  to  make  tax  underpayments  and  other types of non - compliance more costly than compliance.  The Income Tax Act,  2004  does  not  impose  specific  penalties  in  respect  of  non  -  arm's length practices.

Additional  tax,  penalty  and  offence  provisions  applicable  for  failure  to furnish return of income or comply with  Commissioner notice or fraud in relation to return of income, negligence of authorized tax agents, underpayment of installment tax and tax remaining unpaid after the due date as contained in the Act, will apply in all cases of transfer pricing.

## 17.0 ADVANCE PRICING ARRANGEMENT (APA)

## 17.1 General

As  stated  in  paragraph  6.2  above,  the  Commissioner  may  enter  into agreement with a person  to the manner in which the arm's length price shall be determined for the purpose of subsection (1) of section 33 of the Income Tax Act, Cap.332.

An  Advance  Pricing  Arrangement  ('APA')  determines  in  advance,  an appropriate  set  of  criteria  to  ascertain  the  transfer  prices  of  specified related party's transactions over a specified period of time. The provisions under  the  MAP  Article  of  URT's  tax  treaties  and  the  Tanzanian  Income Tax Act enable the Tanzanian competent authority to accede to requests from taxpayers for APAs and to enter into such arrangements.

A bilateral or multilateral APA involves agreement between URT and one or  more  of  its  tax  treaty  partners.  A  unilateral  APA  only  involves  the taxpayer and TRA.

A unilateral APA may not achieve the same level of certainty for taxpayers as in a bilateral/multilateral APA, since the other competent authorities or tax authorities may dispute the unilateral APA given that it is reached in the  absence  of  their  agreement.  Notwithstanding,  a  taxpayer  is  free  to choose between requesting for a unilateral or bilateral/multilateral APA.

The following paragraphs elaborate TRAs' positions on the bilateral/multilateral  APA  process  as  well  as  provide  guidance  on  the application of such APA process.

## 17.2 Key Concepts &amp; Guiding Principles

There  is  no  mandatory  requirement  for  taxpayers  to  seek  an  APA. However, in recognition of  commercial needs,  TRA may make available the  APA  facility  to  taxpayers  who  are  engaged  in  cross-border  related party transactions.

Taxpayers should  evaluate their  own  situations  and  weigh  the  pros  and cons before making a request for APA. If taxpayers choose not to enter into an APA and the transaction is subsequently subject to transfer pricing adjustments,  the  taxpayers  may  rely  on  the  MAP  or  other  remedies available in domestic laws to eliminate double taxation.

In  most  tax  jurisdictions,  an  APA  is  regarded  as  binding  on  the  tax authority  and  on  the taxpayer,  subject  to  any  qualifications  stated  in  the APA.  In  addition, once  an  APA  has  been  obtained  and  taxpayers implement the APA according to the stated conditions, the tax authorities would  suspend  audits  and  penalties  with  respect  to  the  transactions involved  as  long  as  the  terms  of  the  APA  are  complied  with.  Hence, taxpayers should enter into APAs in good faith, with the aim of obtaining certainty that their transfer prices have fulfilled the arm's length principle.

The  APA  process  is  a  facility  available  to  taxpayers  to  avoid  potential double taxation. If taxpayer's request for APA is rejected or the competent authorities fail  to  reach  agreement, taxpayers may still  have  recourse  to the  MAP  or  the  other  remedies  that  is  available  under  domestic  laws, should the taxpayer be subsequently subject to transfer pricing adjustments. Also, taxpayer is not obliged to accept the outcome agreed between the authorities. Taxpayers may withdraw the application, terminate  the  process  or  reject  the  agreed  outcome.  In  such  a  case, taxpayers may seek alternative recourse to eliminate double taxation.

Generally, TRA would accept an APA request if there is a genuine motive to  obtain  certainty  for  the  avoidance  of  double  taxation  and  the  request

relates to specific current or future transactions that are not hypothetical. However, the  other  foreign  authorities  involved  must  also  agree  with  the request.  The  acceptability  of  an  APA  request  is  ultimately  at TRAs' discretion.  However,  should  TRA  decline  an  APA  request,  it  would  offer taxpayer a full explanation of the grounds for declining the request.

With regard to the appropriate period that an APA should cover, TRA is of the view that this should be addressed pragmatically, based on commercial realities. The APA should only cover periods where the critical assumptions and commercial factors that have significant  impact on the validity of the APA are expected to remain unchanged. This basis should also be used to guide decisions on the suitability of applying the terms of the APA to prior years (commonly known as 'roll-back' of the APA). Based on experience, most  APA  requests  cover  3-5  prospective years, in addition to its application to 1-2 prior years.

TRA  appreciates  that  the  usefulness  of  an  APA  to  a  taxpayer  may  be diminished if  a timely agreement cannot  be reached. In this regard, TRA will do its best to expedite the APA process and reach agreement with the foreign tax authorities as soon as practicable. However, the actual duration of  the  process would  depend on the complexity of the issues involved in each  case,  and  the  response  time  of  the  Taxpayer  and  the  foreign  tax authorities.  TRA  will  update  taxpayers  on  the  progress  of  their  requests and indicate the expected timeframe for completion on a regular basis.

## 17.3 Guidance on Making an APA Request 17.3.1 Pre-filing Meetings

The first  step  to  an  APA  application  is  to  arrange  for  pre-filing  meetings with TRA.  At  these  meetings,  taxpayers  should present the salient information such as the company's business model and industry information, transactions to be covered, the period of the APA etc. If TRA is willing  to  accept  the  case  for  APA,  the  taxpayer  will  be  advised  on  the necessary follow-up actions (such as the content of the application to be submitted etc.) and what is expected of the APA process (e.g. the expected timeframe for completion etc.).

For  bilateral  and  multilateral  APAs,  taxpayers  should  undertake  similar meetings with the relevant foreign tax authorities and seek their agreement for an APA as well as their specific requirements with respect to the APA process. It would be helpful if taxpayers share such information from their meetings with the foreign tax authorities with TRA.

## 17.3.2 Formal APA Submission

Unless  TRA  or  the  relevant  foreign  authorities  do  not  agree  to  the  APA request,  taxpayers  should  proceed  to  submit  the  formal  APA  application, which should include the following key components:

- a. General information concerning the taxpayer such as the nature  of  its business  and  its  industry  environment, worldwide organizational structure, etc;
- b. Details  and  explanation  of  the proposed  transfer  pricing methodology and analysis;
- c. All information  and  analyses  needed  to  produce  the arm's length results for the related party transactions;
- d. The set of critical assumptions under which the proposed transfer pricing methodology and analysis will operate;
- e. Period  covered by  the  APA,  including  whether  the  APA would be rolled back to prior years;
- f. Any other information that TRA or the other tax authorities have requested for.

In considering the details to be submitted, taxpayers may also find it useful to refer to the guidance described paragraph 13 of the guideline.

## 17.3.3 Review and Negotiating APA

Upon receiving the formal submission, TRA will commence the process of seeking an APA with the relevant foreign authorities.

This may include meetings with taxpayers to seek clarifications, obtaining more  information,  conducting  site  visits,  consultations  and  negotiations with the relevant foreign competent authorities, etc.

As  with  the  MAP,  the  negotiation  of  a  bilateral  or  multilateral  APA  is  a government-to-government  process.  Hence,  taxpayers  do  not,  as a general  rule,  participate  in  or  attend  as  observers  at  the  negotiations  or consultations  between  the  competent  authorities  but  taxpayers  may  be called upon to provide clarification. However, as the taxpayers concerned are also stakeholders in this process, TRA would regularly update them on the  outcome  of  the  competent  authority  consultations  and  the  expected time frame to complete their cases.

## 17.3.4 Post-Agreement Meeting and Implementation of APA

When an agreement is reached, TRA will meet with the taxpayer within thirty days of reaching the agreement  to discuss the details and implementation of the agreement. TRA will also discuss with the taxpayer on the APA compliance and monitoring requirements.
