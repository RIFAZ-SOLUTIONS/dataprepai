## JUDGMENT  OF  THE  COURT

## RAMAPHANI,  J . A . :

The appellant, Stella Temu, is a lawyer  by training and was employed by the Ministry of  Finance (hereinafter  referred to in short as MOF) in the  taxation  department.  Some  time  in  1996  the  Tanzania  Revenue Authority  (TRA)  became  fully  operational  and  was  charged  with  the collection  of  taxes.  Stella,  like  others,  was  taken  to  TRA  from  MOF. She was  given  by  TRA  a  letter,  Exh.  P 1, of  17 th June,  1996,  titled "Kuajiriwa  na Mamlaka ya Mapato Tanzania", which  reads, in  relevant parts, as follows:

\

2

- 2. ... Hivyo  wafanyakazi  wote  wa  sasa  wa  Idara  za Kodi  chini  ya  Wizara  ya  Fedha  wanatakiwa  kuajiriwa upya kwa masharti ya Mamlaka ya Mapato.
- 3.  Kwa  kuzingatla  maelezo  chini  ya  aya  ya  pili  hapo juu, nafurahi  kukujulisha kuwa  imeamuliwa uajiriwe katika  Mamlaka ya Mapato tangu tarehe  1 Julai, 1996.

Hata hivyo utakuwa katika kipindi cha majaribio (probation) kwa muda wa mwaka mmoja tangu tarehe ya  kukubali  ajira  hii.  Endapo  utendaji  wako  wa kazi  na  tabia  yako  vitaonekena  kukidhi  matakwa  ya ajira  ndani ya  Mamlaka, utathibitishwa  kazini.

Stella  accepted  the  offer  by  her  letter  dated  16 th July,  1996,  Exh. P.

3, which reads in the relevant part:

Nachukua  fursa  hii  kukuarifu  kuwa  nimekubali  uteuzi huo kwa masharti yaliyoelezwa na mengine yatakayoamuliwa  na Bodi ya Wakurugenzi.

On  16  June,  1997  she  was  given  another  letter,  Exh.  P  5,  titled "Kutokuthibitishwa  Kazini  Katika  Mamlaka  ya  Mapato  Tanzania" and reads, in relevant parts, as follows:

... Katika  barua  hiyo  tulikueleza pamoja  na  mambo mengine  kuwa  utakuwa  katika  kipindi  cha  majaribio kwa  muda  wa  mwaka  mmoja  kuanzia  tarehe  1 Julai, 1996 hadi tarehe  30 Juni,  1997. Kutokana  na tathmini tuliyofanya katika kipindi  cha  majaribio, tunasikitika kukujulisha  kuwa hautathibitishwa  kazini.

Kufuatana  na  maelekezo  na  uamuzi  wa  Serikali, TRA inakurudisha Wizara ya Fedha kuanzia tarehe 1/7/1997. Tafadhali  wasiliana na  Katibu Mkuu  kwa maelekezo zaidi.

Stella  decided  not  to  report  to  MOF  but  over  a  year  later,  on  6 th January, 1999, she filed a suit against TRA  alleging wrongful termination  of  employment,  that  the  termination  was  not  done  by a competent  authority,  that  she  was  not  given  the  right  to  be  heard, that the  letter  of termination,  Exh. P. 5, was defamatory,  and that  no reasons were given to  her for the termination.

The  matter  landed  before  RUTAKANGWA,  J. who  framed  five  issues for trial and we paraphrase them as follows:

- i. Was there termination of employment?
- ii. Was Stella given a hearing  before she was terminated?
- iii. Was the termination ordered by a competent  authority?
- iv. Was Stella entitled to be given reasons for the termination?
- v. What reliefs are the parties entitled to?

RUTAKANGWA, 1  found that Stella's employment  was terminated  by a  competent  authority  but  that  she  was  not  given  a.hearing  before the decision was taken and that she was entitled to know the reasons

4

for  the  termination but  that  was  not  done.  However,  the  learned judge was of the decided opinion, based on the evidence of  Patience Minga,  DW 2, who was the  immediate  boss of Stella, that  she would not  have  been  confirmed  in  the  employment  even  if  she  had  been heard because of her irresponsible attitude.  For the  same reason the learned  judge  found  that  Stella  was  not  defamed  and,  therefore, declined to  grant  her damages instead  he gave her general  damages of shs. 2,000,000/=  "for  the wrongful termination  of her  probationary employment".

Stella  is aggrieved  with  that judgment  and  has preferred  this  appeal having four grounds. Before us she was represented by Mr. Malamsha,  learned counsel,  while  TRA had  the services of Mr. Rugaiya,  learned  advocate.  Briefly  the  four  grounds  were  that  the learned trial judge erred by:

- i.  Not annulling the termination and ordering  reinstatement,
- ii.  Framing  new issues suo motu for  which there were  neither evidence nor submissions,
- iii.  Granting  reliefs  not prayed for.
- iv. Subjecting the appellant to double jeopardy of  wrongful termination  by the respondent and termination  by the court.

Mr. Malamsha decided to combine grounds one and three and argued grounds two and four  separately.

*

N^efore we go into the  grounds  of appeal and the  submissions  of  the learned counsel, we think  we need to appraise the evidence which is on record and make up our own findings on certain  important issues. We do this under  Rule 34 (1) which provides as follows:

- (l)On  any appeal  from the decision  of the  High  Court acting  in  the  exercise  of  its  original  jurisdiction,  the Court may  -
- (a)  re-appraise  the  evidence  and  draw  inferences  of fact;

There  are  two  matters  of  fact  which  we  want  to  make  findings  on: .One, what  was the  status  of Stella vis a vis TRA:  was she employed by TRA or was she seconded by MOF pending confirmation  by TRA? Two, and following from one, what did Exh. 5 do: did it terminate the employment  of  Stella  with  TRA  or  did  it  decline  to  confirm  Stella? Most of our questions  to the two  counsel  revolved  around these  two points of fact.

6

We have no doubts in our  minds that Stella was an employee of MOF and  that  it  was  Exh  P 1 which  moved  her  to  TRA.  The  question  is what was the nature of this movement? Was she seconded to TRA or \ v a s she  now  an  employee  of  TRA  and  that  she  had  severed  all relations with  MOF? Admittedly, the word "seconded" was not used in Exh. P 1 or Exh. P 5.

However,  Mr.  Rugaiya  referred  us to  Exh. D. 2, "Waraka  wa  Utumishi Na.  7  wa  Mwaka  1995",  that  is,  "Establishment  Circular  No.  7  of 1995",  issued  on  01  December,  1995. That  Circular  prescribes  three categories  of  services  under  which  a  Government  employee  could work for  a parastatal  or  a Government Agency: There  is secondment under paragraph 3. Then there is attachment  under  paragraph 8, and thirdly, there  is what  we will  refer to  as "departmental  transfer" or as is termed  in the  Circular "uhamisho  wa  moja  kwa  moja". The second mode, attachment,  that  is, assigning  an employee to  a parastatal  for a  specified  period  of  time  after  which  the  officer  goes  back  to  the parent  ministry,  does  not  concern  us  here. The  other  two  types  are

<!-- image -->

\

relevant here  and  we  shall reproduce  the  applicable portions in Kiswahili.

Secondment is provided in paragraph 3 as follows:

## 3. Utaratibu wa  Kuazimwa  (Secondment):

N

Pale inapokusudiwa na inapoamliwa kumpeleka mtumishi  wa  Serikali  kwenye  Shirika  la  Umma  kwa minajili ya kumhamishia huko moja kwa moja, mtumishi  huyo  baada ya kufuata  utaratibu wa Waraka huu  atahamishiwa kwenye  Shirika moja  kwa  moja. Hata hivyo mtumishi huyo atapaswa kuwa katika muda wa majaribio (trial  period)  kwa  kipindi cha  miezi kumi na  miwili (12). Kipindi hicho kitakapokwisha, Shirika  litapaswa  kuamua  kama  litamchukua  mhusika kama mtumishi wake wa kudumu au la. Ikiwa atachukuliwa,  basi  atafuata  masharti  yaliyomo  katika Waraka  huu.  Iwapo  Shirika  litaamua  kutomchukuwa, mhusika atarejeshwa alikotoka bila ya kuchelewa. Endapo  kipindi hicho kitakuwa kimepita na  Shirika halikuchukua hatua zozote za kumchukua au kumrejesha,  na  kama  mhusika  hatakuwa  ameomba kurudi alikotoka, itachukuliwa kwamba ameingia katika  utumishi wa kudumu wa Shirika.

Two  things  are  obvious  to  us  here:  One, the  initiative  of  moving  an employee  from  a  ministry  to  a  parastatal  is  of  the  parastatal  itself, which  under  paragraph  4  is  required  to  make  an  application  to  the Central  Establishment.  There  was  no  such  application  here  and  we think it was  because  all  employees  connected  with  taxation  and custom  duties  were  seconded  to  TRA  from  MOF.  Nevertheless,  the

<!-- image -->

initiative  in  this  case  came  from  TRA  who  wrote  Exh.  P 1  offering employment  to  Stella  in TRA. The  second  thing  is that  an  employee so  seconded  is  taken  on  probation  for  one  year.  This  is  what  was ^contained in Exh. P I .

The  import  of paragraph  3  is  driven home  by  the  provisions  of paragraph 11  which  gives  the  third category of service,  that  is, departmental transfer  or "uhamisho wa moja  kwa moja : ,/

## 11. Utaratibu  wa  Uhamisho wa  Moja  kwa  Moja:

Uhamisho wa moja kwa moja kutoka Serikalini kwenda Shirika la Umma hufanyika  baada ya  mtumishi aliyeazlmwa  kumaliza  muda  wake wa  kuazimwa  kama ilivyoelezwa katika ibara ya [3] hapo juu. Aidha mtumishi  anapojiunga  na  Shirika  la  Umma  kutokana na  uteuzi wa  Serikali; mtumishi huyo  hujiunga na Shirika  linalohusika  moja  kwa  moja  bila  ya  kuwa  na muda wa majaribio kwanza. Kwa madhumuni ya Waraka huu, uteuzi wa Serikali ni pamoja na:-

11.1  Uteuzi  unaotokana  na  Idara  ya  Serikali  kuwa Shirika* la Umma.

It is  abundantly plain  to us  that  in  this  "uhamisho  wa  moja  kwa moja"  the  initiative  is  from  the  Government  and  then  there  is  no probation  period. As we have already observed, Exh. P 1 was written to Stella by  TRA  and  not  by  the  Government  and  then  Stella's

9

engagement  with  TRA  was  prefaced  by probation of one  year. Therefore,  Stella's  engagement  with  TRA  was  NOT  "uhamisho  wa moja  kwa  moja"  but  was  secondment.  After  the  one  year  period  of ^probation TRA could retain Stella, that is, confirm  her engagement or TRA  could  decide  not  to  confirm  her  engagement,  which  is  what  it did vide Exh. P 5. In that case Stella was to report  back to her former employer,  MOF. Likewise, Stella  could  have  decided, after  the  expiry of  the  probation  period,  not  to  work  for  TRA  and  in  that  case,  too, she would have returned to MOF.

The position explained  above is confirmed  by Exh. D. 3, a letter  from the  Central  Establishment  to TRA dated  11 th November,  1998, which said in relevant  parts as follows:

Napenda  kukutaarifu  kuwa  utaratibu  ambao  umekuwa unatumika  katika  kuwahamisha  watumishi  wa Serikali, katika  Idara  ambazo  zimebadilishwa  kuwa  Wakala  wa Serikali (Agencies) ni kuwapa kibali cha kuazimwa katika kipindi cha  mwaka  mmoja  na  katika kipindi hicho  mwajiri  anawajibika  kulipa  Hazina  asilimia  25 ya mishahara  yao kwa  madhumuni ya kuhifadhi  pensheni zao.  Baada  ya  kipindi  cha  mwaka  mmoja  kumalizika inabidi waajiriwa hao pamoja na mwajiri kufanya uamuzi wa kuendelea au kutokuendelea  na kazi katika Taasisi hiyo. Watumishi ambao hawapendelei kuendelea  na kazi au wameshindwa  kutimiza  masharti

inabidi  warudishwe  kwa  mwajiri wao kutafutiwa  nafasi nyingine ya kazi kama ipo au kupungunzwa kazini.

The  final piece of evidence  supporting  the  fact  that Stella was seconded  to  TRA  was  the  fact  that  she  was  on  19 th August,  1996, promoted  from  Finance  Management  Officer  Grade  III  to  Finance Management Officer Grade I  according to the letter to  her from MOF, Exh.  P.  2.  At  that  time  Stella  was  with  TRA  where  her  engagement started from  01 st July,  1996. We asked Mr.  Malamsha  how could that happen  if  Stella  was a permanent  employee of TRA.  How could MOF promote  a person  who  is  not their  employee?  Mr.  Malamsha  merely said  that  the  process  of  promotion  was  in  the  pipeline  when  Stella was  transferred  to  TRA.  That  is  not  a  satisfactory  answer.  Even  if that were so, MOF knew that she was no longer their  employee. The letter  was sent to  her  through TRA.  Our  interpretation  of that  fact is that  MOF promoted  Stella  because she was still  their  employee,  that she was merely  seconded to'TRA,  and that  her continued  stay  there depended on confirmation after the probation period.

So,  our  conclusion  is  that  Stella  was  seconded  to  TRA  and  that  she continued being an employee of MOF.  So, Exh. P. 5, did not terminate  her  employment  but did  not confirm  her  engagement  with \TRA and that she was to go back to MOF. So, grounds one and three which were consolidated  and which sought to fault the  learned judge for  not  ordering  the  reinstatement  of  Stella  is  dismissed.  We  agree with  Mr.  Rugaiya  that  if there  was  no termination  there  could  not be reinstatement.  Equally,  ground four  of appeal that  Stella  was  subject to  double jeopardy  of termination TRA and also  by the  court order  is misconceived  and  is  dismissed  as  was  properly  submitted by  Mr. Rugaiya.

What  remains  now  is  ground  two  that  the  learned  judge suo  motu framed  issues  at  the  time  of  composing  the  judgment  and  thereby denied Stella the opportunity to call evidence in rebuttal. Mr. Malamsha complained of the discussion of defamation  by the  learned judge.  We  agree  with  Mr.  Rugaiya  entirely  that  though  defamation was not framed as an issue, and that was the fault of  both advocates

\

at  the  trial,  the  pleadings  contained  defamation.  Even  Stella  in  her examination-in-chief  said:

»

When  I received  this letter of non-confirmation, I believed that I had failed to perform my  duties efficiently and  I  was  defamed  thereby  as  a  trained lawyer. My employment record as well as my reputation were tarnished. Because of that I am praying  for  damages  to  clear  my  name  and  record.  I am  therefore  praying  to  be  paid  Tshs.  50,000,000/= as general damages. '

Surely,  the  learned  judge  could  not  pretend  that  the  question  of defamation  was not  before  him just  because  no issue was framed on defamation. In  fact this Court  has decided  in one  appeal, following a decision of the former  East African Court of Appeal, that a court  must decide  a  matter  which  it  has  allowed  to  be  argued  before  it  even  if the matter  is not contained in the pleadings.  We dismiss this ground.

The learned judge  found that Stella  had a right  to  be heard  but  that she  was  not.  Also  he  made  a finding  that  she  was  entitled  to  know the  reasons for  the  non-confirmation  which  again  she was  not given. Was the learned judge  right? These two matters could not be subject to  the  appeal,  and  there  was  also  no  cross-appeal.  However,  we

\

intend to  use section 4 (2)  of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act,  1979, as amended  by  Act  No.  17  of  1993,  and  revise  the  proceedings.  That * section provides as follows:

For  all  purposes  of  and  incidental  to  the  hearing  and determination  of  any  appeal  in  the  exercise  of  the jurisdiction  conferred  upon  it  by this  Act, the  Court  of Appeal shall, in addition to  any other  power,  authority and jurisdiction  conferred  by this Act,  have the  power of  revision  and  the  power,  authority  and  jurisdiction vested in the Court from which the appeal is brought.

The  learned  judge  followed' a  number  of  authorities  in  arriving  at those  two  holdings.  The  main  authority  relied  upon  is  of  the  High Court  of  Australia in O'Rourke  v.  Miller  [1980] LRC  (Const.)  654. Unfortunately  it'has  not  been possible for  us to  lay our  hands on that law  report  in Arusha.  However,  that  decision, in turn,  relied  on Chief Constable  of  Northern  Wales  Police  v.  Evans  [1982]  3  All  E R 141, which  we  have  been  able  to  obtain.  In  both  of  these  cases  a  police constable  was  employed but  was  placed  under probation during which  time  the  constable  was  dismissed  without  being  heard  and without  being given reasons.

At page 151 Lord BRIGHTMAN said:

\

My  Lords,  before  I conclude  this unhappy  story, I must turn to the statutory  provision. Regulation  16 of the  Police  Regulations  1971, which  I  need  not  quote verbatim,  provfdes  that  during  his period  of  probation in the force, the services of a  constable may  be dispensed with at any time if the chief officer  of  police considers: (1) that he  is  not  fitted, physically or mentally,  to  perform  the  duties  of  his  office;  or  (2) that  he  is  not  likely  to  become  an efficient  constable; or  (3)  that  he is not  likely to  become a well  conducted constable.

It  is  plain  from  the  wording  of  the  regulation  that  the power  of  a chief  officer  of  police to  dispense  with  the services of a person accepted as a probationer constable  is to  be exercised, and exercised  only,  after due  consideration  and  determination  of  the  specified questions. It  is not a discretion that  may be exercised arbitrarily  and without  accountability.

The  present  case  is  distinguishable.  In  the  case  cited  there  was  a specific  provision  of  law  spelling  out  the  "checklist",  as  it  were,  for dismissing. In the  present case there is no such provision at all. Stella referred  to  performance  appraisal  forms  but  on  cross-examination she  answered  Mr.  Rugaiya  that  "I  do  not  know  if  these  forms  were not  in  existence  when  I  was  in  the  service  of  TRA".  It  was  up  to Stella  to  show that  the forms were  in use at  her time  and that  in her case they  were  not  used  when  considering  her  confirmation.  In  any

<!-- image -->

case  the  forms  are  for  employees  and  we  have  already  made  a finding that Stella was not an employee of TRA.

## Vord  BRIGHTMAN observed further on page 154 that

I turn  secondly  to  the  proper  purpose  of  the  remedy of judicial  review,  what  it  is and what  it  is not. In  my opinion  the  law  was  correctly  stated  in the  speech  of Lord Evershed ([1963]  2 All ER 66 at 91,  [1964] AC 40 at 96). His was a dissenting judgment  but the dissent was  not  concerned  with  this  point. Lord  Evershed referred to-

'a  danger  of  usurpation  of  power  on  the  part  of the courts  ... under the pretext of having  regard to the principles of natural  justice ... I do observe  again that  it  is not  the  decision  as such which is liable to review; it is only the circumstances in which the decision was reached,  and  particularly  in  such  a  case  as  the present the need,  for giving to the party dismissed an opportunity for  putting  his case/

That  was  the case  of Ridge  v. Baldwin and  Others  where  the appellant  had  been  a  police  constable  since  1925  and  rose  to  the rank of Chief Constable.  He was prosecuted together  with two  others for  some  offences  but  he  was  acquitted.  However,  the  trial  judge made  some  comments  which  prompted  the  watch  committee  to discuss  him  and  unanimously  dismissed  him  in  March  1958  without

<!-- image -->

\

giving  him  a  hearing.  Lord  EVERSHED  held  that  the  chief  constable was  entitled  to  a  hearing.  But  Stella  here  was  not  an  employee  of * TRA.

Lord BRIGHTMAN had the same holding when he said on page 154:

Judicial review  is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision-making process. Unless that restriction  on  the  power  of  the  court  is observed,  the court  will  in  my  view,  under  the  guise  of  preventing the abuse of power,  be itself guilty of usurping  power.

I leave  these preliminary observations in order to consider the judgments in the Court of Appeal.  It  was accepted  by  each  member  of the  court  that  the  case fell  within  the  third  of  Lord  Reid's categories;  that  the respondent  was entitled to a fair  hearing; and that  he had not had one.

In  the  present  case,  however,  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  there  was no  right  of  a  hearing  because  there  was  no  termination  but  it  was merely  a  non-confirmation  while  Stella  remained  in  the  employment of  the  MOF.  It  is  our  decided  opinion  that  probation  is  a  practical interview. We do not think that the right to  be heard and to  be given reasons  extends  even  where  a  person  is told  that  he/she  has  failed an interview.

\

With  that  finding  then  comes  the  question  of  remedies:  is  Stella entitled to any damages? The learned judge said this:

I will accordingly  award  the  plaintiff  two  million  (2 million) Tanzanian shillings as nominal general damages for the wrongful termination of her probationary  employment with the defendant.

The  wrongful  termination  was  because  of  "the  breach  of  the audi alteram rule  and  failure  to  give  reasons  for  the  non-confirmation  by the  committee".  As  we  are  of  the  decided  view  that  those  two requirements  do  not  apply,  we, therefore,  quash  the  decision  of  the learned judge of granting two million shillings.

We  wish to make two observations before we conclude this judgment.  One,  Exh.  D.  2,  "Waraka  wa  Utumishi  Na.  7  wa  Mwaka 1995", that is, "Establishment Circular No. 7 of 1995",  was  in existence when TRA wrote the  letter to Stella,  Exh. P. 1, offering  her probationary  service,  TRA  should  have  referred  to  that  Circular  in that  letter  and  should  have  used the  terminology  contained  therein, we  would  have  been  saved  all  this  problem.  Two,  Stella  ought  to

<!-- image -->

have  reported  to  MOF  as  directed  and  matters  would  have  been different.  In fact  by not  reporting  she absconded from. work.

So, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
