dated the 16th day of August, 2013 in Civil Case No. 365 of 2001

## RULING OF THE COURT

12th   &amp;  23r d   October,  2020

## MWAMBEGELE. J.A.:

The applicant,  Urban J.  Mtui, together with one Ngidos Mkamba who is  not a  party to this  appeal  as  he  passed  on  during  the  pendency of the matter in the High Court the subject of this appeal, were employees of the first respondent Upon termination of their employment, they challenged it in the  High  Court  vide  Civil  Case  No. 365  of  2001. The  High  Court (Mwaikugile,  J.)/  on  16.08.2013,  decided  in  favour  of  the  applicant  and

awarded him "Shs. 383,364,476/30 with interest at the rate of 13% on the principal  sum from the date of the suit to the date of judgment and at the court rate of 7% from the date of delivery of judgment till  satisfied  in full plus costs."

The  respondents  did  not  file  any  notice  of  appeal  to  challenge  the decision  of  the  High  Court. However,  about three  years  later;  in  2016, when the applicant commenced the  process  of executing the  decree, the respondents  filed  an  application  in  the  High  Court  for  extension  of  time within  which  to  lodge  a  notice  of  appeal. The  High  Court  (Munisi,  J.) granted the application on  15.09.2016  basically on the ground of illegality of the decision of the High Court. The respondents were given a fortnight reckoned from  15.09.2016; the date of the ruling,  within  which  to file the notice of appeal craved for.

The notice of appeal was prepared on 22.09.2016 and  lodged  in the High  Court on  27.09.2016. However,  it  had  two  ailments;  first,  it  made reference  to  Civil  Case  No.  365  of 2013  instead  of Civil  Case  No.  365  of 2001  and,  secondly,  it  was  lodged  in  the  registry of the  Land  Division  of the  High  Court. We shall  revert to these ailments at a  later stage  in this ruling.

On  21.09.2016,  the  respondents  wrote  the  Registrar  of  the  High Court (Main Registry) requesting for copies of documents in respect of Civil Case  No.  365  of  2013  for  appeal  purposes. Ever  since,  the  respondents stayed  put. This  prompted  the  applicant  to  file  the  present  application taken  out  under  the  provisions  of  rule  89  (2)  of  the  Tanzania  Court  of Appeal  Rules,  2009  (the  Rules). The  same  was  lodged  in  the  Court  on 20.06.2017. It  is  supported  by  an  affidavit  deposed  by  Urban  Jeremiah Mtui; the  applicant, and  resisted by  an  affidavit  in reply  deposed  by Narindwa Sekimanga; a State Attorney in the office of  the second respondent.

On  the  one  hand,  the  gist  of  the  applicant's  affidavit  is  that  the respondents have not taken essential steps towards the furtherance of the intended  appeal  in  that the  notice  of appeal  and  the  letter  requesting  for the documents for appeal purposes are in respect of a non-existent matter; they are not in respect of Civil Case No. 365 of 2001, the matter which the respondents intend to assail. To  him, the applicant deposes,  no essential steps  have  been  taken  by  the  applicant  in  furtherance  of  the  intended appeal. On the other hand, the gist of the respondents' affidavit in  reply is  that the  reference to the year  2013  in  the  notice  of appeal  and  in  the

letter  requesting  for documents for appeal  purposes was  but a  slip of the pen. It is deposed that the respondents still have intention to institute the appeal  but that they  have  not been supplied with the  relevant documents to date.

When the application was placed for hearing before us on 12.10.2020, both parties  were  represented. While  the  applicant  was represented  by  Mr.  Cornelius  Kariwa,  learned  advocate,  the  respondents had  the  services  of  Ms.  Mercy  Kyamba,  learned  Principal  State  Attorney and Ms. Narindwa Sekimanga, learned State Attorney.

In their arguments, the trained minds for the parties, having adopted the  respective  affidavit  and  affidavit  in  reply,  they  did  not  have  much  to add. Mr. Kariwa only added that taking into consideration the chronological set of events deposed in the affidavit and affidavit in reply, it would appear the respondents are not interested in instituting their appeal and hence the notice of appeal which impedes the execution of the decree should  be  struck  out  with  costs. On  the  part  of  the  respondents,  Ms. Kyamba reiterated that the respondents are still interested in instituting the appeal and that is the reason why they filed a notice of appeal and applied for  the  documents  for  appeal  purposes  which  have  not  been  supplied  to them  yet. Ms. Kyamba  relied  on  our  decision in Transcontinental Forwarders Ltd. v. Tanganyika  Motors Ltd. [1997] T.L.R.  328 at 330 cited  in Saleh  Abdi  Mohamed  v.  Katibu  Baraza  la  Mapinduzi  and Another, Civil Application  No. 384/15 of 2018 (unreported) -  [2018] TZCA 334 at www.tanzlii.org. to drive home the point that when they applied for the  documents,  they  had  no  legal  duty  to  make  a  follow  up;  they  were home  and  dry. Ms.  Kyamba  thus  prayed  that  the  application  should  be dismissed with costs.

The  issue  for  determination  by  the  Court,  we  think,  is  whether  the respondents  have  not taken  essential  steps towards the  institution  of the intended  appeal  so  as  to  warrant  us  strike  out  the  underlying  notice  of appeal. The  issue  on  which  the  parties  have  locked  horns  is  on  a  very narrow compass:  whether reference to the year of the case sought to  be assailed  as  2013  instead  of 2001  was a  slip of the  pen  as claimed  by  Ms. Kyamba  for  the  respondents. We  have  dispassionately  considered  the arguments for both parties and the entire record of the application. Having so done, we have serious doubts if reference to the decision sought to be challenged  as  Civil  Case  No.  365  of  2013  was  not  a  deliberate  act. We shall demonstrate. However,  before  such  demonstration,  in  order  to

appreciate the decision we are going to make, we find it apt to reproduce the  notice  of  appeal  and  the  letter  requesting  for  documents  for  appeal purposes. The notice of appeal was annexed to the affidavit as Annexture UM-5.  It reads:

Reference is made to the above heading.

We  hereby  inform  you  that,  we  have  been  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of Honourabel Mwaikugile, 3. delivered on 16th  August, 2013 in the above named Civil Case.

In view thereof, we hereby urgently request your good Office to avail us with the following documents for appeal purposes:-

- 1. Copy of Judgment
- 2. Copy of Proceedings
- 3. Copy of decree and drawn orders
- 4. Certificate of delay under Rule 90 (1) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules, 2009

Thanks in advance.

C.  Mtae

FOR:  ATTORNEY GENERAL"

Having  reproduced  the  notice  of  appeal  and  the  letter  which  was written  by the  respondents  requesting for a  copy of proceedings so as to challenge the decision of the  High Court, we  now proceed to demonstrate why  we  do  not  think  reference  to  the  decision  as  Civil  Case  No.  365  of 2013 was not a deliberate act.

First,  when  the  matter the subject of this application was decided  in favour  of  the  applicant,  the  respondents  did  not  immediately  seek  to challenge  it  by  way  of an  appeal. They sat  back and  relaxed  until  some three years later when they filed an  application for extension of time after the  applicant  wrote  them  a  letter  bearing  Ref. No.  CK/GC/2015  dated 18.11.2015 annexed to the affidavit in support of the application seeking to execute the decree of the High Court.  The High Court (Munisi, J.) granted the  extension  relying  on VIP  Engineering  and  Marketing  Limited  v. Citibank Tanzania  Limited, Consolidated  Civil  Reference  Nos.  6,  7,  and 8 of 2008 (unreported). In essence, it was on the basis of the illegality of the decision of the High Court the respondents were granted the extension applied for, not that they had good cause for the delay.

Secondly,  the  notice  of  appeal  the  respondents  filed  having  been granted  the  extension  sought  made  reference  to  Civil  Case  No.  365  of

2013, not Civil  Case  No.  365  of 2001. Reference to the year 2013, Ms. Kyamba deposed that it was a slip of the pen.  We understand  Mwaikugile, J. delivered  the  judgment  in  respect  of  the  parties  on  16.08.2013  and, everything being equal, we would have said the error was a slip of the pen. That is, ordinarily, we would have agreed with this contention if it were not for its recurring, as hereunder demonstrated, coupled with other seemingly deliberate  ailments which  takes  it away from  the  realm  of the  slip  of the pen.

Thirdly,  the  notice  of appeal  referred  to  in  the  foregoing  paragraph was lodged in the registry of the Land Division of the High Court. This course of action  by the  respondents baffled  us. The dispute between the parties was  not at ail  related to  a  land  dispute  and  the  parties  had  never referred  their  dispute  to  that  court. Why  should  the  respondents  have resorted to lodge it in the land division of the High Court? Given the lousy way  the  respondents  handled  this  matter  from  the  outset  compels  us  to agree with  Mr.  Kariwa that the  respondents had  no intention to appeal  so as to assail the decision.

Fourthly, the letter by the respondents bearing Ref. No. AGC/MISC/2016/4/13 dated 21.09.2016 purporting to apply for documents

for  appeal  purposes  was  addressed  to  the  Registrar  of  the  High  Court (Main  Registry). We wish  to  state  at this juncture  that even  though  the letter  indicates  "(Main  Registry)" the  same  was  cancelled  and  against  it the words "at Dar es Salaam" were scribbled. No initials were  inserted to suggest  the  scribble  words  were  in  were  meant  to  replace  the  "Main Registry". This adds yet another puzzle as to which court was addressed.

The  suit whose  decision  is  sought to  be challenged  was filed  in  the High  Court,  Dar es Salaam  Zone. Thus, addressing the letter to the  Main Registry of the High Court served no useful purpose and this enhances our worries of the respondents not intending to institute the intended appeal.

Fifthly,  the  letter  by  the  respondents  referred  to  in  the  foregoing paragraph,  made  reference to  Civil  Case  No.  365  of 2013  instead  of Civil Case  No.  365  of  2001. Again,  the  same  arguments  in  respect  of  such reference  in  the  notice  of  appeal  above,  are  useful  here. We  shall  not repeat them.

Lastly,  the  notice  of  motion  and  affidavit  in  this  application  were served on the respondents way back in 2017. Ms.  Kyamba so admitted at the hearing of the application. The respondents never filed an affidavit in reply until  12.10.2020; the date of the hearing when we granted the prayer

by  Ms.  Kyamba  to  have  it accepted  as  on  the  previous  working  day,  the Registrar of the Court couid not admit it for not being  brought within three working days.

In  view  of  the  above  discussion,  we  have  serious  doubts  if  the infraction by the respondents to refer the impugned judgment as Civil Case No.  365 of 2013 instead of Civil Case No.  365 of 2001, to lodge the notice of  appeal in the Land Division of  the High Court  and  to  apply  for documents for  appeal  purposes to the  Registrar of the  High  Court  (Main Registry) was not by design. If anything, we think the ailment is far from being a lapsus calami as  Ms.  Kyamba would  have us believe. It seems to us  diligence  of  the  respondents  in  instituting  the  intended  appeal,  with profound respect to Ms.  Kyamba, is questionable. From the look of things, we,  respectfully,  do  not  think  the  shortcoming  is  an  excusable  keyboard mistake  as  Ms.  Kyamba  argued  with  some  considerable  force. It  is  our considered view that the  respondents' way of handling the matter at hand leaves a lot to be desired.  What explanation is given of lodging in the Land Division of the High Court a  notice of appeal which  had  nothing to do with a  land  matter?  Or  what  made  the  respondents  address  the  letter  to  the Registrar of the  Main  Registry of the  High  Court while the case was filed,

heard and determined by the High Court,  Dar es Salaam Zone?  When we put these questions to  Ms.  Kyamba  at the  hearing,  she  did  not  have  any plausible  explanation. She  ultimately  surrendered  the matter  to  the wisdom  of  the  Court. And  to  take  the  matter  a  little  bit  further,  what prevented the respondents from filing an affidavit in reply in the year 2017 when they were served with the application? Surely,  we do not think the respondents were  not deliberately  negligent  in  dealing  with  the  matter at hand. In the circumstances, the authorities relied upon by the respondents; Transcontinental  Forwarders  Ltd (supra) and Saleh Abdi Mohamed (supra) are distinguishable from the instant case.

For the  avoidance  of doubt,  with  the  current  position  of the  Rules, Transcontinental  Forwarders Ltd (supra) is no longer good  law -  see: rule  90  (5)  of the  Rules. As per rule 90  (5)  of the  Rules,  the  Registrar is mandatorily  required  to  ensure  a  copy  of  the  proceedings  is  ready  for delivery within  ninety days from the date the appellant requested for such a  copy. Likewise,  the  appellant  is  mandatorily  required  to  take  steps  to collect the copy  upon  being  informed  by the  Registrar to do so,  or within fourteen days after the expiry of the ninety days.  See also: Arthur Kirimi

Rimberia  &amp; Another v.  Kagera Tea  Company  Ltd  &amp; 3  Others, Civil Application No. 364/01 of 2018 (unreported).

Flowing from the above, we are satisfied that the cumulative effect of the  respondents' acts  in  dealing  with this  matter would  suggest that they are not interested  in  instituting the  intended  appeal  hence their deliberate acts of not taking essential steps towards the institution of the purportedly intended  appeal. As  we  observed  in Olivia  Kisinja  Mdete  v.  Hilda Mkinga, Civil Application No. 4 of 2011 (unreported):

"The law is now settled[  upon lodging a Notice o f Appeal\  the  intending  appellant must not sit back but  is  required  to  move  the  process  forward  by taking essential steps that have been clearly outlined  by  the Court  o f  Appeal  Rules. The applicant was entitled to move the Court under Rule 89  (2)  to  strike  out a  notice  o f appeal  where  no essential steps have been taken beyond that notice."

[Quoted  in AIRTEL  Tanzania  Ltd  v.  Tanzania Revenue  Authority, Civil  Application  No.  148  of 2014 (unreported)].

We wish  to  underline  that the  essential  steps  envisaged  by  rule  89 (2) must be in respect of the decision sought to be challenged and relevant

documents  lodged  in  the court which  pronounced  it. It  is  also  important that  the  letter  requesting  for  documents  for  appeal  purposes  must  be addressed  to  the  registrar  of  the court  which passed  the  impugned judgment.  Lodging the notice of appeal in a registry of the court which did not  pronounce  the  impugned  judgment  and  addressing  the  letter  to  the registrar  of  the  Court  which  did not  decide  the  matter  sought  to  be challenged  as  happened  in  the case  at  hand  are of no  consequences,  for they will  not  amount to taking  essential  steps  in  advancing  the  institution of the  intended  appeal. Simply  put,  the  totality  of the  above  discussion shows that contrary to  rule  90  (1)  of the  Rules,  there was  no  request to the  Registrar,  High  Court at Dar es Salaam for the supply of the  requisite documents for appeal  purposes as required  by the rule. Accordingly,  the respondents,  as  already alluded  to  above,  cannot avail  themselves of the shield  in Transcontinental  Forwarders Ltd (supra). In  our considered view,  that  shield  is  only  available  to  a  diligent  litigant  as  opposed  to  the indolent.

In the upshot, we  find merit in the application and grant it. Consequently, we are constrained to strike out the notice of appeal lodged by the respondents on  27.09.2016 seeking to challenge Civil Case No.  365

of 2013 (sic)  delivered  by the  High  Court (Mwaikugile,  J.)  on  16.08.2013. Bearing  in  mind that the subject of the dispute stems from the employeremployee relationship, we make no order as to costs.
