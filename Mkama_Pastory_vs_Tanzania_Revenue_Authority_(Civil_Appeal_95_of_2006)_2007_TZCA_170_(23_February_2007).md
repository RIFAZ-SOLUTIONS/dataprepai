(Appeal from the Ruling of the High Court of Tanzania at Mwanza)

## (Mchome, 3.}

dated the 10t h  day of March, 2005 in HC Civil Case No. 10 of 2001

## REASONS FOR THE COURT DECISION

## MROSO. J.A.:

When  we  heard  this  appeal on 12t h February, 2007  we sustained a preliminary objection by the respondent and struck it out with costs.  We now give our reasons.

In  a  ruling  of the  High  Court  at  Mwanza  (Mchome,  J.)  dated 10t h March, 2005 the respondent succeeded in a preliminary objection  it had  raised and,  as a  result, the appellant's plaint before the High Court was struck out for failure to disclose a cause of action.

The appellant was aggrieved by the ruling and appealed against it to this Court.

Before the appeal could be called on for hearing counsel for the respondent, Mr. Teemba, raised two grounds of preliminary objection against  the  appeal  in  a  notice  which  was  duly  filed  nineteen  days prior to the hearing date. The notice was followed by a supplementary notice of preliminary objection containing two additional  grounds, making  a  total  of  four  points  of  preliminary objection.

At  the hearing  of  the points  of  preliminary objection Mr. Teemba,  learned  counsel,  abandoned  the  fourth  point  of objection and also conceded that the first ground of objection was misconceived. As  a  result,  only  two  grounds  of  objection  were argued by Mr. Teemba.  The two grounds read as follows:-

- "(2) That  the  appellant  did  not  comply  with  the mandatory  provisions  of  Rule  90  (1)  of  the Tanzania  Court of Appeal  Rules,  1979,  (G.N. No. 102 of 28t h  September,  1979).

- (3) The Record of Appeal is defective by containing  an  Extract  (sic)  Order whose date is different from the date of the Ruling which is appealed against, contrary to the mandatory  provisions  of  order  XX  Rule  7  of the Civil Procedure Act, Cap. 33 R.E.V. 2002."

Mr.  Teemba  submitted  that  on  the  basis  of  either  of  those  two grounds the appeal was incompetent and should  be struck out with costs.

After putting up  some  resistance  to  the  third ground of objection  Mr.  Magongo,  learned  advocate for the appellant,  yielded. He conceded that the extracted order which was filed did not comply with Order 20 rule 7 of the Civil  Procedure Code,  1966 and that the defect rendered the appeal  incompetent and  liable to be struck out. He did not proceed to argue against the second ground of objection.

We  intend to dispose of  ground (2) of  the grounds of preliminary objection. Rule 90 (1) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 1979 (the Rules) provides as under:-

"90 (1)  The appellant shall,  before or within seven days  after  lodging  the memorandum  of appeal  and  the  record  of  appeal  in  the appropriate  registry,  serve  copies  of them on each respondent who has complied with the requirements of Rule 79."

It is apparent that the appellant lodged his memorandum of appeal in the Court registry on  22n d   March,  2006 and the  record of appeal on 13t h July, 2006. He  was,  therefore, required  to  serve  on  the respondent both the copy of the memorandum of appeal and of the record of appeal within seven days of the lodging of those documents if the respondent had complied with Rule 79 of the Rules. It will  be recalled that Mr. Teemba informed the Court that the respondent was not  so  served  within  the  stipulated  period. It  was  served  on  13t h July,  2006  which  was  some  113  days  after  the  memorandum  of appeal  was  lodged  in  the  Registry,  which  would  appear to  be  well beyond seven days. The  question, however, is whether  the respondent had complied with Rule 79 of the Rules to be entitled to be  served  the  memorandum  of  appeal  and  the  record  of  appeal within the stipulated  period. Rule 79  (1)  which  is the  relevant  part reads:-

- "79 (1) Every  person  on whom  a  notice  of appeal is served shall -
- (a) within  fourteen  days  of  service  on him  of the  notice  of appeal  lodge  in the appropriate registry and serve on the intended appellant notice of a full and sufficient address for service; ..."

Mr. Teemba said to Court that the respondent complied with Rule 79 of the Rules. But he did not point to any particular document in the record as proof  of  such compliance  and Mr. Magongo  for  the appellant did not address the Court on this ground of objection.  The Court,  on  its  part,  has  gone  through  the  whole  of  the  record  of appeal  and  could  not  find  trace  of  a  notice  under  Rule  79  (1)  (a) lodged by the respondent.  We take it, therefore, that no such notice was filed in fact.

It  appears  to  us  that  since  the  obligation  on  the  appellant under  Rule  90  (1)  of the  Rules  is  contingent  upon  the  respondent complying with the requirement under Rule 79 (1) (a) of the Rules, and since the respondent does not appear to have complied with that rule, the obligation on the appellant to serve both the memorandum

of  appeal  and  the  record  of  appeal  on  the  respondent  within  the period stipulated under Rule 90 (1) of the Rules does not arise. We, therefore, dismiss that ground of objection.  We now wish to consider ground (3) in the Supplementary Notice of Preliminary Objection.

The decision against which the appeal is sought was pronounced by the High Court on 10t h  March, 2005 but the extracted order  was  signed by  the  judge who  gave  the ruling on 19t h December,  2005. The  dating  and  signing  of  the  extracted  order appears under the following words -

"Given  under  my  hand  and  the  Seal  of  the Court this 19t h  day of December, 2005."

Obviously, the date differs from the date the ruling of the court was given.

Order 20 Rule 7 of the Civil Procedure Act, Cap. 33 of the Laws of Tanzania, Revised Edition of 2002 reads:-

"The decree shall  bear the date on which the judgment  was  pronounced  and,  when  the judge or magistrate has satisfied  himself that the decree has been drawn  up in accordance with the judgment he shall sign the decree."

At first Mr. Magongo attempted to argue that Order 20 rule 7 of the Civil  Procedure Act, Cap. 33 (the Act) relates to decrees only and that the Act is silent as regards orders like the one under consideration. Therefore,  according  to  him,  Order  20  rule  7  is inapplicable.  When the Court called his attention to the provisions of Order 40 rule 2 of the Act, he conceded that orders, too, have to be signed and dated bearing the date the ruling was pronounced.

Order  40  of  the  Act  is  on  appeals  from  Orders. Sub-rule  2 thereof reads

- "2.  The  rules  of Order XXXIX  shall  apply,  so far as may be, to appeals from orders."

Now, Order 39 which is referred to in Order 40 (2) relates to appeals in original decrees.  That would include a decree under Order 20 rule 7 of the Act which  is  required to  be dated as of the date when the judgment was pronounced. We think,  therefore,  that on the  same parity of reasoning  an  extracted  order of the  High  Court in  original jurisdiction is required, under the authority of Order 40 (2) of the Act, to bear the date when the ruling from which the order was extracted was pronounced. We are of the view that that should  be the case

because  it  could  not  have  been  the  intention  of the  legislature  to require a decree to bear the date when the judgment  was pronounced but leave it open for an extracted order to bear any date regardless of when the ruling appealed against was pronounced.  The question now is, what would be the legal status of an appeal which is accompanied  by  an  extracted  order  which  does  not  bear  the  date when the ruling was pronounced?

We  have  not  been  able  to  find  from  the  available  resources judicial  pronouncements specifically on orders. However, in a recent decision of this Court in Jovin Mtagwaba and 85 Others v. Geita Gold  Mining  Limited, Civil  Appeal  No.  109  of  2005  (unreported) this Court held that an  appeal  which was accompanied  by a  decree which did not bear the date when the judgment was pronounced was incompetent and the appeal was struck out.

Mulla on The Code of Civil Procedure, Fifteenth  Edition  at page  1524  commenting  on  rule  7  of  Order  20  which  is  rendered substantially  like  rule  7  of  Order  20  of  the  Act  underscored  the importance of the date of a decree.  He said:-

"Under  this rule, the decree comes into existence on the date of the judgment, though  it  is  signed  later. Decree comes  into existence as soon as the judgment is pronounced  and  not  on  the  day  it  is  signed and sealed  later. For the purpose of appeal, time runs from the date of pronouncement of the judgment."

We  think  that  is  the  correct  position  in  law. We  also  think  that, again,  on  a  parity  of  reasoning,  the  same  should  be  the  case  with extracted orders mutatis mutandis.

The  date  of  a decree, and by  extension  of  an order, is important not only in reckoning time for appeal but also for purposes of period  of limitation  in  the  case  of an  application  to  set aside  an exparte decree or order. Furthermore, the right to execute a decree or order accrues from the date it is pronounced,  not on the day it is signed. We are,  therefore,  firmly  of the  view  that an  order which does not bear the date when the judgment or ruling was pronounced is  not valid. It follows that an appeal to this Court which does not contain a correctly dated decree or order will not have complied with the  requirements of Rule 89  (1)  (h) of the Court Rules,  1979. The

Rule requires that for purposes of an appeal from the High Court in its  original  jurisdiction,  the  record  of  appeal  shall  contain  among other documents a copy of the decree or order.

The appeal before the Court does not contain a copy of a valid extracted  order. We do  not consider that the  omission  is  a  mere irregularity  but  it  goes  to  the  root  of  the  appeal. Mr.  Magongo appears to concede this legal position.

The consequence of the appeal  record  lacking  a valid  order  is drastic  but inevitable. Although  strictly  speaking  Order  20  rule  7  of the Civil Procedure Act refers to a decree and not to an order, for the reasons which we have attempted to give, creating a parity between a  decree  and  an  order  for  the  purpose  of  dating  an  order  we sustained  the  third  ground  of  Preliminary  Objection  and  struck  out the appeal with costs.

DATED AT MWANZA this 23r d  day of February, 2007.
