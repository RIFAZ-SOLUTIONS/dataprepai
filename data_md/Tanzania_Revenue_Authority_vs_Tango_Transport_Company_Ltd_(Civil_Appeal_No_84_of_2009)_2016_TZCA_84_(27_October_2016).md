(Appeal from a judgment and decree of the High Court of  Tanzania at Arusha)

## (Mushi, J.)

dated the 5th day of December, 2003 in Civil Case No. 38 of 2000

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

## 24th &amp;  27th October, 2016 OTHMAN, C.J.:

The appellant, Tanzania Revenue Authority (T.R.A.) is aggrieved by the judgment and  decree of the  High  Court  (Mushi, J.), entered  in  favour of the respondent, Tango Transport Company Ltd.

At  the  hearing  of the  appeal  on  24/10/2016  Mr.  Akonaay  O'hhaySang'ka, learned Advocate represented the appellant  and Mr. Kalolo Bundala,  learned Advocate represented the respondent.

Before determining  the merits  or  otherwise of  the appeal it is essential that a brief account of the background be narrated.

The respondent  company  (plaintiff), which operated  a  transport business  in  Arusha  sued  the  appellant  (2nd  defendant)  and  two  others  at the High Court  for  general  damages, restoration on the value  of  its properties,  a Scania  lorry  (Reg.  No.  TZ  94444)  and  a trailer (Reg.  No.  Tz. 92238),  interest  and  costs  arising  out of the  sale  at a  public  auction  on 18/8/2000 of the vehicles  prompted  by  a warrant of distress (Exhibit  D.1) for  Tz. Shs. 8,219,538/=  that  was  issued  under  section  109(1)  of  the Income Tax Act,  Act  No.  33  of 1973  on  16/02/1999 by  the  Commissioner of Income Tax.

In  its  judgment,  the  High  Court  held  that  the  respondent  had  no existing tax liability payable to T.R.A.  at the time of effecting the warrant of distress  and  its  vehicles  were  not lawfully  distrained  and  sold. It awarded the  respondent  Tz.  Shs.  110,000,000/=  as  the  replacement  value  of the vehicles,  USD  2,704,000  as  loss  of  business,  Tz.  Shs.  200,000,000/=  as general damages, interest and costs of the suit.

Having closely examined the record  and  after full consideration of the parties' oral  and  written  submissions,  we  are  of the  settled  view  that the fate  of the  appeal  can  be  appropriately  determined  on  ground  one  of the appellant's memorandum of appeal.

## It states:

The learned High Court Judge erred in law in entertaining  the  suit based on  the  tax  liability  without satisfying  himself as  to  whether  the  Respondent  had exhausted the  legal  remedies  available  under  the  Tax Laws and Regulations.

Mr.  Bundala  admitted  that  much  as  at the  High  Court  no  objection was  taken by  T.R.A. on  the  trial court's  jurisdiction to  entertain and determine the suit,  a question  of jurisdiction can  be  taken  at any stage of the  proceedings,  even  on  appeal  as  held  by  the  Court  in Michael Leseni Kweka  v.  John  Eliafe, Civil  Appeal  No.  51  of  1997  and Mr.  Reginald Abraham  Mengi  and  Mrs  Mercy  Anna  Mengi  v.  The  Loans  and Advances  Realization  Trust, Civil Appeal No.  45  of  2001 (All COA, unreported).

Mr. Bundala's  essential submission  was  that  the  High  Court  had wrongly  assumed  jurisdiction  to  determine  the  suit, which  was  a  tax dispute arising from a tax assessment and triable by the Tax Appeals Board or Tax  Appeals  Tribunal  established  under  sections  88-90  of the  Income Tax  Act.  That  the  suit  involved  the  respondent's  tax  liability  was  evident from  paragraphs 6 and  7 of its amended plaint.  Moreover, the suit had also challenged the warrant of distress issues  by T.R.A.  under section  109(1) of

the  Income  Tax  Act,  1973  and  the  Income  Tax  (Distraint)  Rules,  1975 (G.N.  No  7  of  1975).  That  under  sections  89(1),  89B  and  90(1)  of the Income  Tax  Act,  the  authority  and  specific  forums  for  determining  tax disputes were  respectively,  the  National  Tax  Appeals  Board,  the Zonal  Tax Appeals  Board  and  the  Tax  Appeals  Tribunal.  As  the  remedies  available under the Income Tax Act were not first exhausted  by the respondent, the High  Court was  barred  from  exercising jurisdiction. He  relied  on Tanzania Revenue Authority v. Kotra Company Ltd, Civil  Appeal  No.  12 of 2009 and Tanzania Revenue Authority v.  New Musoma Textiles Ltd; Civil Appeal  No.  93  of 2009 (All COA,  unreported) where the Court stated that it would not entertain a matter for which a special forum has been established by law, unless  the  aggrieved party  can satisfy it that  no appropriate remedy is available in that special forum.

That apart,  Mr.  Bundala  submitted  that it was  also  not open  to the respondent to file  a suit  in  court as  sections  108 and  109 of that Act only permitted T.R.A. to file a suit for the recovery  of a tax  liability and  did  not grant that right  to  a taxpayer  to  challenge  an  income  tax  assessment  by T.R.A.  by way of a suit. The respondent led  no evidence to satisfy the trial court  that  there  was  no  appropriate  remedy  available  under  the  Income Tax Act.  He  should  have first instituted  his claim  before the special  forums

under that Act,  and only upon exhaustion of the remedies available therein, he  could  have  turned  next to the civil  court.  He  invited  the Court to allow the appeal, with costs.

Resisting, Mr. O'hhay-Sang'ka conceded that the question of jurisdiction  was the  most "bitting" on  this appeal.  However,  he  strenuously submitted  that at this  appeal  stage  the  question  of jurisdiction  cannot  be entertained  given  that T.R.A.  neither  raised  it at  the  High  Court  and  nor was  it objected  to in  its  written  statement of defence  or that of the  other co-defendants.

Mr. Ohhay-Sang'ka went on to submit that the High Court's jurisdiction,  which  a court should  jealously guard  and  not lightly oust,  had not been  specifically ousted  by the Income Tax Act.  He  relied  on Gosbert Mujumuzi v.  Dihimulali  Matende [1969] H.C.D.  138 and  Mtenga v. University of Dar es Salaam [1971]  H.C.D.  247.

He contended that the suit was  not a pure tax dispute.  Centrally,  the suit was for damages arising out of the unlawfully issuance of a warrant of distress,  a hoax  document,  by  T.R.A.  which  occasioned  loss  of use  of the respondent's  distrained  vehicles.  The  Income  Tax  Act  did  not completely oust the jurisdiction  of the  High  Court to try a dispute which  involved  the award  of damages for  unlawful  distrain  by  T.R.A.  The  suit could  also  not

have  been  determined  under the  Income Tax  Act  as  it  had  no  provisions granting  the  respondent a right  to  damages.  The  Income Tax  Act  did  not bar or oust the civil  court's jurisdiction to deal  with  non-tax  matters or the warrant of distress executed outside the law, one and  a half years after its invalid issuance. The  authorities  cited by  T.R.A., he submitted, were decided  before  the  coming  into  effect  of the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act, Cap. 408, which came into effect on 01/07/2001 (G.N. No. 126 of 29/06/2001).

We  now advert to the merits of ground  one  of the  memorandum  of appeal.

'Jurisdiction' is  defined  in Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.  10, para.  314 to mean:

"the authority  which a Court  has to decide matters  that  are  litigated  before  it  or  to  take cognizance of  matters prescribed in a formal way for  its  decision. The  limits  of this  authority are imposed  by  the  statute; charter or  commission under which the court is constituted, and may be extended  or  restrained  by  similar  means. A limitation may be either as to the kind and nature of the claim,  or as to the area which jurisdiction

## extended, or  it  may  partake of  both these characteristics (Emphasis added)"

Principally, objection  to  the  jurisdiction  of  a  court  is  a  threshold question  that ought to  be  raised  and  taken  up  at the earliest opportunity, in order to save time, costs and avoid an eventual nullity of  the proceedings in the event the objection is sustained.

The  law  is  well  settled  and  Mr.  Bundala  is  perfectly  correct  that  a question  of  jurisdiction  can  be  belatedly  raised  and  canvassed  even  on appeal  by the  parties or the court suo moto, as  it goes  to  the  root of the trial  (See, Michael Leseni Kweka; Kotra Company Ltd; New Musoma Textiles  Ltd.  cases, supra). Jurisdiction  is  the  bedrock  on which  the court's authority and competence to entertain and decide matters rests.

That said,  section 7(1) of the Civil  Procedure Code, Cap.  33  R.E.  2002 ought  to  be  our  main  starting  point  in  resolving  the  "bitting"  issue  of jurisdiction. It provides:

"The  courts  shall (subject  to  the  provisions  herein contained have jurisdiction  to try all suits of civil nature excepting suit of  which their cognizance is either  expressly  or  impliedly  barred" (Emphasis added).

Section  7(1)  of our Civil  Procedure  Code  is  an  import of section  9 of the  Indian  Civil Procedure  Code,  1908.  In The  General  Manager,  of Telecommunications,  Thiruvanaathapuram  Department  v  Jacob and  Ors. [2003]  INSC  196,  the  Supreme  Court  of  India  explained  the scope of that section this way:

''It  is well settled that the court has jurisdiction to try all suits of  a civil nature and the exclusive of  jurisdiction of the  civil  court  is not  to  be  lightly  interfered. Such exclusion must be either explicitly expressed.  Govindbhai Ratnabhai &amp; Ors.  [1968) INSC 202;  AIR  1969 SC  439 (para.7).  This court observed that it  is necessary to bear in  mind the important principle of  construction  which  is that if  a  statute excluded the  ordinary jurisdiction  of  a civil court it must do  so  either by express terms  or by the use of  such  terms as  would necessarily lead to the inference of  such exclusion.  This principle was reiterated in Dewaji v Ganpatalal [1968) INSC 179; AIR SC 560.  It is  also  well settled that a provision  of law ousting  the jurisdiction  of  a  civil court must be strictly constrained and  onus  lies on the  party  seeking"  ....  (See also/ Anisminic  v  Foreign  Compensation  Commission [1962) A.C. 14~ 170/ HL}.

The  respondent's  amended  plaint  filed on 8/09/2000  averred  in paragraphs:

- "6. That on or about the 1  ffh of  August, 2000 the first Defendant purported to sell the Plaintiff's lorry by public  auction  claiming  that  the  Plaintiff has defaulted and/or  refused to pay outstanding tax  to  the  Income  Tax  Department of the Second Defendant.  The  Plaintiff was  never served with any notice indicating the amount claimed by the  Second Defendant and/or reason as to why his motor vehicle has to be sold  to recover an unspecified tax.
- 7. The plaintiff avers that whatever  further assessments that might have been made by the second named defendant the same did not include  withholding tax amounting to a substantial  sum.

8.

..

....... .. .............................................. .... .. ... . . . ... . ......... ..  .

It  is averred that at  the said auction the managing director of  the plaintiff appeare~ on  being  alerted  by  independent  source, and offered to pay the tax  being claimed and even went as far as bidding for the said motor lorry and the said trailer" (Emphasis added).

In its written statement of defence,  T.R.A.  disputed the claim on  the ground that it lawfully sold the respondent's vehicles following a warrant of

distress  it had  issued  in  order to  recover  Government  revenue  which  was long overdue from the respondent.

On  a careful analysis of the  pleadings,  in  our respectful  view the real questions  in controversy  that  arose  in  the  suit  included  the  following issues. What was  the  respondent's taxable income?  Whether or not it had any  tax  liability,  for  which  years  and  at  what  amount?  Whether  the  tax liability,  if  any,  included  accumulated tax and  for which years? Whether the warrant of distress was  properly issued,  served and  executed by TRA or its agents.  Whether T.R.A.  was  entitled to write-off any tax balance due from the  respondent  from  the  balance  of  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  the vehicles? Whether  or  not  the  respondent  had taken any  objection  to T.R.A.'s assessment of its tax liability.

In our respectful view, the primary case spelt out by the substance of the  pleadings  was  fundamentally a tax  dispute founded  on  the warrant of distress, an  instrument or order issued  under section  109(1) of the Income Tax  Act  and  The  Income  Tax  (Distraint)  Rules, 1975  to  recover  a  tax liability  from  the  respondent  by  means  of distress  levied  upon  a  warrant. The allegation  of or claim  for damages in  the respondent's amended  plaint was  only  attendant.  It was  to  say  the  least,  fully  dependent  on  a  prior determination  of the  respondent's correct taxable  income, assessment and

liability for the  periods  1989,  1996 and  1997,  including  T.R.A's entitlement to  the  collection  of and  recovery  of any  due  and  unpaid  tax  by  distress upon  the  respondent's  goods  or  chattels  under  section 109(1)  of  the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax (Distraint) Rules,  1975.

Sub-section  1 of section  109 provides:

"109(1) In any case  in  which  tax is recoverable  in  the manner provided by section 108 the commissioner may, instead  of suing  for  such  tax, recover  the  same  by distress,  and for that purpose may by order under his hand authorize any public officer or an officer of  a court to execute such distress upon the goods and chattels of the person from whom such tax is recoverable and such officer may,  at the cost of  the person from  whom such tax is recoverable employ such servants or agents as he may think necessary to assist him in the execution of  the ,.,. t ,, ulS ress:  .......... ... .......  .

That the High Court eclipsed its authority by entertaining and determining  chief  issues  on  tax  assessment  and  liability  that  were  legally outside its competence  is also  plainly corroborated  by the issues it framed, namely,  whether  the  respondent  had  an  existing  tax  liability  payable  to T.R.A.  at  the  time  of  the  distress  and how  much?  and  whether  the respondent's  vehicles  were  lawfully  distrained?  With respect, these  live issue were plainly and manifestly taxation in nature.

We fully  agree  with  Mr.  Bundala  that the  dispute  instituted  in  court by  respondent's  original plaint  on 22/8/2000,  which  was  subsequently amended  was  first  and  foremost  to  have  been  justiciable  by  The  Tax Appeals  Board  or Zonal  Tax  Appeals  Board  or the  Tax  Appeals  Tribunal, respectively, under  section  89(1)  (a), 89B, and  93(1)  (a)  of  PART  XV OBJECTIONS,  APPEALS AND  RELIEF  FOR  MISTAKE of the Income Tax Act. Those  forums  were  complete  in  that  they  had  own statutory  rules  of procedure  (The  Income  Tax  (Appeals  Boards)  Rules,  (G.N. No. 218  of 1975)  and  The  Income  Tax  (Appeals  Tribunal)  Rules,  (G.N.  No.  217  of 1975).

Furthermore, under section 91(1) of  the Income  Tax Act the respondent  was  entitled  and  free  to  take  up  an  objection  against  a  tax assessment  by  T.R.A.  In  our  respectful  view,  these  constituted  specific forums  for  the  adjudication  of  any  tax  dispute  or  liability  (See, Korta Company  Ltd  and  New  Musoma  Textiles  Ltd. cases (supra). These legal avenues had to be first exhausted by the respondent, whose assistance  he  neither  sought  nor  attempted  to  seek  before  recourse  to  a civil  Court and  if warranted.

All considered, with  respect, the  High  Court  by  entertaining  and determining  the  tax  dispute  between  the  parties  travelled beyond  its

jurisdiction,  which  was  expressly ousted  by the specific forums established under the  Income Tax  Act. It erroneously  crowned  itself with  jurisdiction that it did  not possess  in  entertaining and determining the suit,  which  was fundamentally a tax dispute.

Accordingly,  we  are  constrained  to and  hereby  invoke our  revisional powers  under section 4(2) of the Appellate Jurisdiction  Act,  Cap. 141  R.E. 2002 to  declare  a  nullity,  quash  and  set  aside  the  entire  proceedings, judgment and  decree of the  High  Court.  To  meet the justice of the case, we make no orders as to costs.

The appeal is hereby allowed.
