VERSUS

THE COMMISIONER GENERAL

TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY...............................................RESPONDENTS

(Appeal from Judgment of the High Court of Tanzania at Mbeya)

## (Mrema, J.)

Dated the 20th  day of September, 2007 in Civil Case No. 2 of 2002

## RULING OF THE COURT

20th   &amp; 23r d  July,  2010

## LUANDA. J.A.:

The  above  named  appellant  is  dissatisfied  with  the  finding  of  the High Court sitting at Mbeya  in Civil Case  No.  2 of 2002.  He duly processed his appeal by first lodging his notice of appeal and eventually on 23/11/2007 filed his appeal.

On  7th March,  2008  the  respondent  filed  a  preliminary  objection under the then  Rule  100 of the Court of Appeal  Rules,  1979 to the effect that the appeal  is incompetent for failure to comply with Order XX,  Rule 7 of  the  Civil  Procedure  Act,  Cap  33.  The  above  stated  Rule  deals  with decree.

When  the  matter  came  up  for  hearing,  Mr.  Evarist  Mashiba,  Legal Officer  with  the  respondent  informed  the  Court  that  their  counsel  has travelled  outside  the  country.  He  prayed  that the  matter  be adjourned  to another date.

Having gone through the record and having  perused the copy of the decree,  we  were  of the view that the objection  is  meritorious.  Instead  of adjourning  the  matter,  we  asked  Mr.  Victor  Mkumbe  learned  counsel  for the  appellant  whether  he  conceded  to  the  point  raised.  Mr.  Mkumbe  did not.  He was of the view that the decree is properly dated and signed.  So, the appeal is properly before the Court, he submitted.

Rule  89(1)  of the  Court  Rules,  1979  enumerates  documents  which are  mandatorily  required  to  be  emboded  in  the  record  of  appeal  from matters arising from the  High Court in  its original jurisdiction.  One of such document is a copy of a decree (see paragraph (h) of sub-Rulel of Rule 89 of the Rules). A copy of decree from matters originating from High Court is required to be properly dated and signed.

This  is  provided  under Order XX,  Rule  7  of the  Civil  Procedure Act, Cap 33 RE 2002. The Rule reads.

- 7.  The  decree  shall  bear  the  date  of  the  day  on which  the  judgment  was  pronounced,  and,  when the  judge  or  magistrate  has  satisfied  himself  that the  decree  has  been  drawn  up  in  accordance  with the judgment he shall sign the decree.

There is a chain of authorities to the effect that the record of appeal which contains a decree which is not properly dated and/or signed renders the  appeal  incompetent  and  such  appeal  is  liable  to  be  struck  out  (see:

Bahadnarali E. Shamji &amp;  another  V  The  Treasury Registrar, Ministry of Finance  &amp; 4 Others Civil  Appeal  No.  4  of 2003, Uniafrico Ltd  &amp;  2  Others  V  Exim  Bank  (T)  Ltd Civil  Appeal  No.  30  of  2006; Mkama Pastory V TRA Civil Appeal  No. 95 of 2006;  Ami (TZ)  Ltd V OTTU on behalf of P.L. Assenga and  106 others Civil  Application  No. 72 of 2002; Haruna  Mpangaos and 902 others V Tanzania  Portland Cement Co.  Ltd Civil  Appeal  No.  10  of  2007 and  Kashemeza  Phares Kabuye  V.  Choya  Anatory  Kasazi Civil  Appeal  No. 110  of  2007  (all unreported).

In Uniafrico Ltd case cited supra, the Court held, we quote:

"Under  the  Rule, it is clear  that  a  decree  must unambiguously set the date on which the judgment was given. So, the decree must bear the same date as the judgment. The date of the decree is the date on which judgment was delivered -  see Sarkar on Civil  Court  Practice  Procedural  Manual, Tenth Edition, at  page  205.  The  date  is  important  for purposes of limitation because the period of limitation  for an  appeal from a judgment runs from the date on which it was pronounced".

In the instant case the decree, which does not comply with the court forms either, reads as hereunder:-

## DECREE

The Plaintiff  prays for the following orders:-

- (a) Payment of TShs  603,423,452/=  as  claimed above in the plaint.
- (b) Interest o f  1% per day o f  the Decretal current from  the  date  o f  filing  this  suit  till  when payment is made in full.
- (c) An  order  that  the  Plaintiff  was  wrongfully retired by the Defendant.
- (d) An  order  that  the  Plaintiff be  reinstated  in service at fu ll  pay from the date o f  retirem ent till the date o f  compulsory retirem ent which is 3Cfh  day o f  June, 2004.

- Costs o f  this suit  paid  by the defendant
- Any  other  order(s)  this  court  deems  fit  to grant -

This case coming on this 2(fh day  o f Septem ber,  2007 for final  disposal  before Honorable A. C. Mrema, Judge in the presence  o f  the  Plaintiff  his  Advocate  Mr. Mashiba learned counsel for Tanzania Revenue Authority Defendant

## IT   IS  ORDERED that:

For fairness and interest o f Justice,  I  hereby direct that PW1  submit to  Tanzania Revenue Authority  his  proper  transport  costs  by  1st class train from Mwanza to Kigoma via Tabora and  then  by  road  to  Makamba Village in Kasuiu  D istrict Such  costs  should  include subsistence  allowances  as  well  as  costs  for the  approved  luggage. The  rate  should  be those applicable in  the market in  1999  when PW1 retired.  I f the total costs for repatriation will surplus (sic) the amount admitted to have been  paid  to  PW1  when  he  vacated office, then  the  difference  should  be  paid  to  him forthwith.  As regards costs,  I  am o f the  view that the nature o f  the suit is not one  justifying this  court to  order costs against the plaintiff who has lost the suit.

In sum the suit is hereby dismissed save for the  exception  on  repatriation  allowance  as directed above. I make no order as to costs.

GIVEN  under my hand and the  seal o f the Court this l&amp; h day o f  O ctober, 2007.

A.C. MREMA JUDGE

Signed on 5th  day o f Novem ber,  2007 by Hon.  S.  B.  Lukelelwa,  Judge on grounds that the  presiding  Judge  has  vacated  office  by virtue o f  achieving the compulsory retirem ent age.

## (Emphasis supplied)

In the instant case  the  judgment  was  delivered on 20/9/2007; whereas the "decree" bears three different dates at different  places  as  reproduced  above.  The  decree  was  sealed on  19/10/2007  but  was  signed  on  5/11/2007.  Obviously,  the date  of  the  decree  differs  from  the  date  the  judgment  was pronounced.  Taking  the  "decree"  as  it  is,  it  is  clear  that  the

mandatory  requirements  of  Order  XX, Rule 7 of  the Civil Procedure Code, Cap. 33 were not complied with.

We would  have  ended  here.  But  we  would  like  to  point out, in passing, that even the decree itself was not substantially  drawn  in  conformity with  the  forms  in  use  under the  Indian  Code  of Civil  Procedure  1908  which  are  in  force  in Tanzania  by  virtue  of  section 101(3)  of  the  Civil Procedure Code, Cap.  33 as the same are yet to be replaced. The section reads:

101(3)  All  forms  heretofore  in  use  in  connection with  proceedings  under  the  Indian  Code  of  Civil Procedure, 1908, as in force in Tanzania shall, where  applicable  and  subject to  such  variations  as may be necessary, be deemed to be forms approved by the Chief Justice for use in connection with  proceedings  under this Code  until  replaced  by forms  prescribed  or  approved  by  the  Chief Justice under subsection(l).

In Uniafrico case the Court reproduced a decree form and it reads:

## DECREE IN  ORIGINAL SUIT (ORDER 20, RULES 6,7)

Given under  my  Hand  and  seal  o f  the court this............. day o f.............. 2010.

Judge

As already said the drawn decree in this appeal was  not drawn as per the above form.

In  sum  as the  record  of appeal  does  not contain  a  valid decree,  the  appeal  is  incompetent.  The  same  is  struck  out. Since  it  is  the  Court  which  played  a  big  role  in  disposing  the preliminary objection,  we think it is prudent that each  party to bear its own costs.

It is so ordered.

DATED at MBEYA this 21st day of July, 2010.
