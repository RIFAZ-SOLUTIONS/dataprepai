## Acknowledgement

This is the second revised edition 2023/2024 of the CSOs Tax Toolkit 2024. The idea of preparing and publishing the first Toolkit was brought up during Civil Society Organizations' Directors Reflection Meeting in Mwanza in 2019. This proposal was well received by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and CSOs across the country. The first edition of this Toolkit was developed in 2021. For the purpose of updating this Toolkit with annual reforms related to finance and tax laws, TRA and THRDC agreed to review and update the Toolkit annually.  This second edition was validated by 200 representatives of CSOs on 3rd October, 2023 at Morena Hotel in Dodoma. The validation session was conducted as one of the side events during the 2023 Annual NGOs forum in Dodoma.

The process of updating this Toolkit enjoyed wider consultations of about 1500 Non-Profit Organizations across the country who have been approached for their views in different ways. The list of CSOs that had been consulted is long, but we must take this special opportunity to thank them for their efforts and their valuable contributions. We also appreciate and recognize the leadership and close cooperation accorded to this work by Chairperson of NGOs Board, Ms Mwamtum Mahiza, Ag. Director of Taxpayer Education and Communication at TRA, Mr Hudson Kamoga, Registrar of NGOs, Ms Vickness Mayao and Chairperson of NACONGO, Dr Lilian Badi.

Specifically,  we  would  like  to  thank  all  organizations  that  participated  in  the  process  of  developing this document under the leadership of the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC). These organizations  among  others  include  the  National  Council  of  NGOs  (NACoNGO),  Wajibu  Institute  of Public Accountability (WIPA) and financial contribution by the UK Aid funded Accountability in Tanzania Programme (AcT2), Ford Foundation, European Union, and Sweden.

We would also like to thank members of the technical team from TRA and THRDC who devoted much of their time and expertise to develop and come up with this revised edition of the CSOs Toolkit. The technical team involved (Mr. Maternus Emily Mallya (Principal Tax Management Officer), Adv. Octavian Kichenje (Legal  Counsel),  Ms.  Kanasia  Malisa  (Principal  Economist  and  Mr.  Joram  Katemana  (Tax  Management Officer) all from TRA. Other team members included Adv. Onesmo Kasale Olengurumwa - Certified Tax Consultant from Afritanza Attorneys and National Coordinator THRDC and Adv. Paul Kisabo, Protection and Litigation Officer from THRDC. It is our belief that this second version will be useful to the Non-Profit sector given the current tax compliance challenges facing CSOs in Tanzania.

## General Overview

## Preamble

Nonprofit organizations are required to pay taxes and file returns as guided under the laws. Previous studies and consultative discussions involving over 200 NGOs Directors, representatives from the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and the Ministry of Finance and Planning conducted at different occasions in 2019 highlighted various challenges faced by nonprofit organisations in complying with  tax  laws.  This  simplified  guide  intends  to  enhance  knowledge  and  skills  on  the  legal  and administrative aspects to assist nonprofit organizations to become more compliant to the tax laws.

## About this Guide

Taxation  for  nonprofit  organisations  in  Tanzania  is  a  guide  on  tax  issues  relevant  for  nonprofit organizations  legally  registered  and  operating  in  the  country  under  different  statutes.    This guide:·

- · explains basic requirements for registering with TRA as a taxpayer
- · explains  the  basic  legal  and  practical  details  of  relevant  taxes,  levies,  duties  and concessions   applicable

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- · highlights common misconceptions by non-profit organisations under the different types of  taxes, duties and levies.
- · contains  information  on  how  to  become  a  'Charitable  Organisation'  and  taxation  of charitable organisations.

The  information  in  this  guide  is  not  exhaustive.  It  focuses  on  taxes  that  CSOs  found  most challenging to comply with. The guide also acts as a supplement information from TRA website, Tax Consultation Bureau (DSM), and Regional Taxpayers Education and Communication Officers of TRA found countrywide.

NB: This toolkit does not substitute any Tax Laws or procedure. The tax laws shall prevail in case of any inadvertent conflict.

## 1.  Defining a Nonprofit Organisation

The term nonprofit covers different types of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) including Non-Governmental Organisations  (NGOs),  Charitable  Organisations,  Faith  Based/Religious  Organisations,  Trusts,  Associations, Community Based Organisations, Cooperative Societies, Legal Aid providers, Philanthropic Organisations etc.

An organisation qualifies as nonprofit if:

- · It operates for purposes other than deriving profit or gain and it does not allow any distribution or deemed distribution of profit generated out of its business or undertakings; and
- · Its profit, if any must be ploughed back and used solely for improving or expansion of the original organization purpose or function.
- · Its  constitutive  documents  prohibit  profits  or  assets  distribution  for  the  benefit  of  particular persons.

In Tanzania, nonprofit organisations are registered under different laws the most common ones are:

- · The Non-Governmental Organisations Act, [Cap 56 R.E. 2019]
- · The Societies Act, [Cap 337 R.E. 2019]
- · The Trustees Incorporation Act, [Cap 318 R.E. 2019]

NOTE: Organizations eligibility is determined on monthly basis. Due to nature of funding and activities, non-profit organisations may have less than ten (10) employees with formal contracts but from time to time engage several others on casual or volunteer basis and pay them allowances. When that happens and the total number of persons receiving payment exceeds ten (10), then the organisation becomes liable to pay SDL on that month.

<!-- image -->

A nongovernmental organization may also enjoy exemption of VAT on importation of goods listed under items 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 of Part I of the schedule to the Value Added Tax Act, 2014. Such exemptions refer to the importation and local supplies of medicine or pharmaceutical products, articles designed for people with special needs, education materials, health care and education services.

Such exemptions refer to the imported goods such as imported food, clothing or other goods e.g. shoes for free distribution to orphanages or to schools for children with special needs; or on imported emergency goods for disaster relief; or in case of religious organization, on goods imported for free  provision  of  health,  water,  education,  or  religious  services  and  in  case  where  there  is  any consideration it should not be more than 50% of the fair market value.

An organisation that is eligible for exemption is required to make an application for exemption in writing to the Commissioner General before imported goods are cleared through the customs.

## The application must be supported with the following document:

- a)   An application letter by the head of the organisation or the one acting on behalf.
- b) An introduction letter from District Commissioner (DC) where the project is implemented.
- c) An introduction letter from a Ward Executive Officer (WEO) where the project is implemented.

- g) Organization's annual procurement plan
- h) Organizations utilization report accounting for the remission granted during the previous year (if any)
- i) Donation certificate in case of donated goods
- j) Distribution plan on the imported goods (especially when imported goods are in a form of general merchandise)

## NOTE

- 1. Under Section 2 of the Value Added Tax Act, [Cap 148 R.E. 2019] a nonprofit organization means a Religious or Charitable organisation established and functions solely for (a) the relief of poverty or distress of the public, (b) the provision of general public health, education or water; and (c) the supply of religious services.
- 2. In  whatever circumstances there is no exemption on excise duty.  Accordingly, therefore when a nongovernmental organization imports aged motor vehicles (more than 8  years for private cars of carrying capacity not more than 10 passengers and those aged more than 5 years for public motor vehicles of carrying capacity of more than 10 passengers from the date of manufacture); will be required to pay excise duty as provided for under the provisions of the Excise (Management and Tariff) Act, [Cap 147 R.E. 2019].

## 3.2 Important Points

## 3.2.1 Timely  Submission  of  Applications

Most organisations eligible for exemptions do not submit applications on time. Organisations are advised to send the application as early as possible to have the ruling made before arrival of the goods to avoid storage and demurrage charges unless the request is related to emergency interventions.

## 3.2.2 Offenses on Disposal of Import Duty Exempt Goods.

When non-profit organisations that have benefited from import duty exemptions do not follow prescribed procedures for disposal of related assets and pass on the benefit to persons not entitled to such benefits, they are committing an offense under section 119 of the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004.

## 3.2.3 Accountability for Past Exemptions

For accountability purposes, organizations receiving exemptions are required to provide utilization reports accounting for the remission previously granted (and asset disposal procedures wherever applicable).

## The table below illustrates the computation.

| Take any income generated by the charitable/religious organisation during the year of income                                        | xxxx   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Add: All gifts and donations received by the same during the year                                                                   |        |

## F. Worked Examples on Computations of Taxable Income of a Charitable Organisation

## Worked Example 01:

Suppose the income of the organization from its charitable business is TZS. 250,000,000 excluding TZS. 50,000,000/= received by way of voluntary contributions. It is assumed that the income applied for the purposes of nonprofit organisation is TZS. 180,000,000.

| TRANSACTIONPARTICULARS                                       | AMOUNT      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Income from charitable business for the year ended Dec 2019  | 250,000,000 |
| Voluntary contributions deemed income Under section 64(2)(a) | 50,000,000  |
| Income from charitable business for the year of income       | 300,000,000 |
| Less: Income applied in pursuit of its functions             | 180,000,000 |
| Surplus/Unapplied income for the year of income              | 120,000,000 |
| Less 25% of gross receipt (additional allowance)             | 75,000,000  |
| Income chargeable to corporate tax                           | 45,000 ,000 |

It is important to note that as deliberated above, the maximum non-application of income admissible is 25 percent of the total income of the organization (that is 25 percent of TZS 300,000,000.) which is TZS 75,000,000. The balance of unapplied income in the amount of TZS 45,000,000 is liable to tax during the year of income.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Worked Example 02

M/s Trust is a charitable Organisation providing charitable services in Tanzania. During the year 2017, it had income of TZS 15,000,000 of which TZS 12,000,000 was applied toward charitable functions. Since unapplied income of TZS 3,000,000 was less than 25% of the total income, the amount was not taxed.

During  year  2018,  the  Organization  derived  income  of  TZS  25,000,000  of  which  TZS  10,000,000  was applied towards its charitable functions. The Organisation applied to the Commissioner General to be allowed to save TZS 8,750,000 to be applied towards its functions in the year 2019. The Commissioner General allowed saving of the amount. The balance of TZS 6,250,000 which is TZS 25,000,000 less TZS 18,750,000 (TZS 10,000,000+8,750,000) was not taxed.

However,  the  Organisation  ceased  to  be  a  charitable  Organisation  in  the  year  2019  before  applying to its functions the amount of TZS 8,750,000 saved from its charitable business in the year 2018. The Organisation made income of TZS 16,000,000 during the year 2019.

| TRANSACTIONPARTICULARS                                       | AMOUNT     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Business income for year 2019                                | 16,000,000 |
| Surplus amount in year 2018                                  | 6,250,000  |
| Unspent amount in 2018                                       | 8,750,000  |
| Total income for the year 2019                               | 31,000,000 |
| Less: 25% of the Gross earned income (25% of TZS 25,000,000) | 6,250,000  |
| Taxable income for the year 2019                             | 24,750,000 |

## Annex 3:    Tax Audit and Disputes Resolution Mechanisms

Tax Audit is conducted by the TRA to review the compliance status of the Organization. The Tax Audit may extend up to three years or more. Taxpayers have an obligation to maintain their documents for audit purposes for a period not below five years.

## TRA audits process/Flow of events

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Relevant Documents to Prepare after Receiving an Audit Notification.

Tax liabilities may arise due to lack of sufficient information on the taxpayer to support her claims such as expenditure and other allowable deductions. In the absence of supporting documents, TRA auditors are likely to decline some expenses and other allowable deductions resulting into a tax liability. Therefore, NGOs are advised to ensure that they provide sufficient information and/or documents supporting their claims in the course of audit.

## The following are some of the important documents that may be required:

- · Financial statements
- · Projects  contracts/Agreements
- · General ledgers
- · Tax returns
- · Bank statements respective schedules Proofs of payment.
- · Lease agreements
- · Any other relevant information/documents

## Responding Audit Findings and Lodging Objections

Failure  to  respond  to  audit  findings  or  lodge  objection  within  the  prescribed  time  may  have  adverse consequences on the taxpayer. Once audit findings have been issued to a taxpayer, the taxpayer is obliged to respond to the same by replying to every tax claim raised by auditors, with supporting evidence. The Commissioner shall evaluate the response &amp; supporting evidence and issue Notice of assessment/tax liability. The taxpayer after receiving notice of tax liability, if aggrieved, is supposed to lodge an objection

<!-- image -->

with or without an application for waiver. In doing so, the taxpayer must observe statutory timelines. Taxpayer has a right to request for extension of time to file his response to audit findings or to lodge an objection, as the case may be.

- i. A taxpayer is required to respond to audit/examination findings within fourteen (14) days from the day of receiving the findings.
- ii. A taxpayer may be given an extension of time (not exceeding fourteen (14) days) to respond to the findings, upon giving reasonable grounds for extension.
- iii. The Commissioner may grant extension of time upon request by the taxpayer who has reasonable ground(s) to warrant extension of time to file an objection against a tax decision.
- iv. In case of objections, the taxpayer is supposed to lodge the same within 30 days from the date of receiving notice of assessment. The taxpayer may request the extension of time.
- v. The taxpayer is supposed to pay one third (1/3) of the tax liability or undisputed amount whichever is greater.
- vi. The taxpayer may request for a waiver of this requirement or to pay any lesser amount.

Note that if paragraph (v) and (vi) above are not complied with, the objection lodged shall not be admitted.

<!-- image -->

## Stages for Dispute Resolution

## 1. Filing an Objection to the Commissioner General

A  person  aggrieved  by  the  assessments  issued,  may  file  an  objection  to  the  Commissioner  General within 30 days. The objection should be in writing stating the grounds upon which it is made. (TAA S. 51)

The Commissioner shall  determine an objection  within six  months  and  issue  final  assessment.  In case the Commissioner fails to determine the objection within six months, the assessment will be confirmed by operation of law.

## 2. Appeals to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board

In case the taxpayer is aggrieved by determination of objection, or confirmation by operation of law, the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board ('TRAB') within 30 days. The appeal should be in writing stating the grounds upon which it is made. (TAA S. 53) and S.16 of Tax Revenue Appeals Act (TRAA)

## 3. Appeals to the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal

Where the taxpayer is aggrieved by the decision of TRAB, he may appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (TRAT).

## 4.  Appeals to the Court of Appeal

A taxpayer who is not satisfied with the decision of  TRAT, may appeal further to the Court of Appeal of Tanzania (CAT).

Note that in preferring appeals, the taxpayer MUST observe the prescribed timelines.

## Alternative Disputes Resolution Negotiations with the TRA in case of Disagreements?

Yes, there are possibilities to do negotiations which is done through the third party by way of mediation.

- · Mediation: a third party is involved to get the TRA and taxpayers to agree where it is no longer possible for them to reach an agreement on their own (potential role of tax ombudsman). This procedure can be involved where a complaint relates to services delivery, procedure or administrative matter arising in the course of administering tax law by TRA, the Commissioner or staff. It does not concern matters of legislation or tax policy or matters that are subject to tax objection or appeal.
- · Settlement: The TRAA allows parties to an appeal to enter into an amicable settlement concerning their dispute at any stage when an appeal is pending before TRAB or TRAT. The settlement if successful is adopted and pronounced as a decision of TRAB or TRAT as the case may be.

NOTE: NPOs are encouraged to have tax consultants or trained lawyers to assist them on regular basis on issues related to tax compliance,

## Tax Ombudsman duties includes:
