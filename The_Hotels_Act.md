- (b) the  register  or  other  books  of  accounts  or  other  documents maintained by the owner or the returns filed by him are incorrect, inadequate, false or too scanty in any material particulars,

- (a) an additional levy equal to twenty-five per centum of the unpaid amount of  the  levy  shall  thereupon  become  and  be  payable  by way of penalty by that owner;
- (b) if any amount remains unpaid by the owner for more than thirty days after the date upon which it is, by regulations made under this  Act,  required  to  be  paid,  the  rate  of  the  additional  levy prescribed by paragraph (a) shall be increased by ten per centum of the amount of levy remaining unpaid in respect of each period of  thirty  days  or  part  of  it  after  the  date  during  which  such amount  remains  unpaid,  and  such  additional  levy  by  way  of penalty shall become and be payable by such owner accordingly.
- (2) Any sum payable by way of penalty under this section shall, for the  purposes  of  this  Act,  be  deemed  to  be  levy  and  shall  be  collected  and recoverable accordingly.
