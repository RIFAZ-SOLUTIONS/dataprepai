## Proceedings under this Part not to bar prosecution section 161 of the Tax Administration Act 2014

Persons paying duty or penalty may recover same in certain cases

51. If  any  instrument chargeable with duty and not duly stamped, not being a receipt, an acknowledgement of a debt, a bill of exchange or a promissory  note,  is  produced  by  any  person  of  his  own  motion  before  a Stamp Duty Officer within one year from the date of its execution or first execution, and such person brings to the notice of the Stamp Duty Officer the fact that such instrument is not duly stamped and offers to pay the Stamp Duty Officer the amount of the proper duty, or the amount required to make up the same, and the Stamp Duty Officer is satisfied that the omission to duly stamp such instrument was occasioned by accident, mistake or urgent necessity, he may, instead of proceeding under sections 44 and 49, receive such amount, and proceed in the manner prescribed by section 51.

52. -(1) When the duty and penalty (if any) leviable in respect of any instrument have been paid under section 46, 49 or 50 the person admitting such instrument in evidence or the Stamp Duty Officer, as the case may be, shall certify by endorsement thereon the receipt of the proper duty or, as the case may be, the proper duty and penalty, stating the amount of each and the name and residence of the person paying the same.

53. The taking of proceedings or the payment of a penalty under this Part in respect of any instrument shall not bar the prosecution of any person who  appears  to  have  committed  an  offence  against  this  Act  or  the  Tax Administration Act in respect of such instrument.

54.(1) When any duty or penalty has been paid under section 46, 49 or section 50 by any person in respect of an instrument, and, by agreement or under the provision of section 40, or any other written law in force at the time when such instrument was executed, some other person was bound to bear  the  expense  of  providing  the  proper  stamp  for  such  instrument,  the first-mentioned person shall be entitled to recover from such other person the amount of the duty or penalty so paid.

(2)  For  the  purpose  of  recovery  of  any  sum  of  money  under subsection  (1)  any  certificate  granted  in  respect  of  such  instrument  under this Act shall be conclusive evidence of the matters certified unless the court is  satisfied  that  the  person  signing  the  certificate  did  not,  at  the  time  of signing it,  hold the  office  which  is  required  to  be  held  for  the  purpose  of

- 56.(1)  If  any  instrument  sent  to  a  Stamp  Duty  Officer  under subsection (2) of section 47 is lost, destroyed or damaged during transmission, the person sending the same shall not be liable for such loss, destruction or damage.

Provided that in the event of the loss, destruction or damage of the original instrument such authenticated copy shall be admissible in evidence in any court.

- 57. When  any  bill  of  exchange,  promissory  note  or  cheque  is presented  for  payment  unstamped  or  insufficiently  stamped,  the  person  to whom it is so presented may affix thereto the necessary adhesive stamp, and upon cancelling  the  same  in  manner  herein  before  provided,  may  pay  the sum payable upon such bill, note or cheque, and may charge the duty against the  person  who  ought  to  have  paid  the  same,  or  deduct  it  from  the  sum payable as aforesaid, and such bill, note, or cheque shall, so far as respects the duty, be deemed good and valid:

Provided that nothing herein contained shall relieve any person from any penalty or proceedings to which he may be liable for failure to properly stamp such bill, note or cheque.

58. Without prejudice to any other method of recovery of duty and penalties payable under the Act, where any amount of duty or penalty is due from any person, the Commissioner-General may lodge an appeal with the Tax Revenue Appeals Board, a certificate stating-

(b) the amount due, and  upon  such  certificate  being  lodged  with  such  Board,  such  certificate shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  decree  passed  by  such  Board  against  the  person named in the certificate for payment by such person to the Government of the amount stated in the certificate together with interest thereon at twenty per centum per annum from the date on which such certificate is filed until the  date  of  payment,  and every  such  decree  may  be  executed in  the  same manner as a decree passed by a court of a Resident Magistrate in a civil suit.

79. Where any person dies then, to the extent to which any stamp duty remains unpaid shall be a debt due and payable out of his estate.

80.(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this act, where the Commissioner has reason to believe that any person who is liable to pay stamp duty under any provision of this Act-

- (a) is about to leave the United Republic without having paid such duty; or
- (b) has left the United Republic without having paid such duty and his absence is unlikely to be only temporary,

he may, whether or not the due date for the payment of such duty has arrived, by notice in writing served on such person require-

- (i) that payment of the whole, or such part as remains unpaid,  or  payable  be  made  within  such  time  as may be specified in the notice; or

(2)  Where  any  notice  has  been  served  on  any  person  under  this section the amount of the stamp duty payable and required to be paid shall, notwithstanding that an appeal is pending or a request for reference to the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  has  been  made,  be  deemed  to  be  due  and payable on the  date specified in  such  notice  and  in  default  of  compliance with  such  notice  the  Commissioner  shall  in  addition  to  any  action  taken under subsection (3) of this section or under section 77 be entitled forthwith to recover the duty by suit or distress under this Act:

Provided that, if subsequent to the commencement of any suit under this  section  complies  is  made  with  such  notice,  any  such  suit  shall  be discontinued.

- (a) that an amount of stamp duty is due and payable by such person;
- (b) that such person has failed to comply with such notice; and
- (c) that  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  such  person  is  about  to leave the United Republic,

he may issue a warrant to arrest such person and bring him before the court to show cause why he should not pay such duty or give security therefor to the satisfaction of the Commissioner:

Provided that such a person shall not be arrested if he pays to the officer entrusted with the warrant the amount of the stamp duty due.

(4) Where any person is brought before a court under subsection (3) of this section fails to show cause as thereby required, the magistrate may order him either forthwith to pay the amount of stamp duty due or forthwith to  give  security  thereof  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Commissioner  and,  in default  of  compliance,  to  be  committed  to  prison  until  either  such  stamp duty due is paid or such security given:

Provided that-

- (a) no  such  person  shall  be  detained  in  prison  for  a  longer period than six months;
- (b) the detention in prison of any such person shall not release such person from the liability to pay such duty.

(5) In any proceedings under subsection (3) or (4) of this section the production of a certificate signed by the Commissioner giving the name and address of the person and the amount of stamp duty due and payable by him shall  be  sufficient  evidence  that  such  amount  of  stamp  duty  is  due  and payable by such person.

- (6)  The  compliance  by  any  person  with  a  notice  served  on  him under subsection (1) of this section shall not prejudice his right to appeal or to  request  for  reference  to  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  and  finally  if upon  determination,  the  amount  of  stamp  duty  due  and  payable  by  such person is-
- (a) less than the amount paid, then the amount overpaid shall be refunded together  with interest  thereon  at  such  rate  as  the court may order;
- (b) more than the amount paid, then the amount underpaid shall be payable as if it were a balance of stamp duty charged.

Collection of stamp duty by distrait Act No. 13 of 1996

s. 48

81.(1) Where any security has been given under subsection (1) of section 79 and such security consists of a form of guarantee under which, in default of payment of stamp duty in terms of the security, a person (in this section referred to as guarantor) is obliged to pay such duty the Commissioner may, in default of payment of the duty by notice in writing served on the guarantor require him to pay within ninety days of the notice, such amount of stamp duty (not exceeding the amount guaranteed by him) as shall be specified in such notice.

(2) The provisions of this Act relating to the collection and recovery of stamp duty shall apply to the collection and recovery of the amount of stamp duty specified in a notice added under this section as if that amount were stamp duty due and payable by the guarantor and as if the due date of the payment of that amount were the date upon which the amount was due for payment under the notice.

- 82.(1) In any case in which stamp duty is recoverable by suit by the Commissioner, he may, instead of suing for such stamp duty, recover the same by distress, and for that purpose may by order under his hand authorise any public officer or an officer of a court to execute such distress upon the goods and chattels of the person from whom such stamp duty is recoverable and  such  officer  may  at  the  cost  of  the  person  from  whom  such  duty  is recoverable, employ such servants or agents as he may think necessary to assist him in the execution of the distress:

## Provided that-

- (a) where the full amount of the stamp duty due and payable is not  recovered  by  such  distress,  the  Commissioner  may forthwith recover the deficiency in any other manner provided by this Act;
- (b) where the full amount of stamp duty due and payable has been paid after the issue of an order under this section and before  the  execution  of  distress,  any  costs  and  expenses incurred by the Commissioner prior to the payment of the stamp duty shall be deemed to be a debt due and payable to the Government by the person in respect of whom the order was issued and may be recovered by the Commissioner as stamp duty under this Act.
- (2)  For  the  purposes  of  levying  any  distress  under  this  section  an officer  authorised  under  subsection  (1)  of  this  section  together  with  such servants or agents as such person may consider necessary, may break open in  the  daytime any premises, and any such officer may require any police officer  to  be  present  while  such  distress  is  being  levied  and  any  police officer so required shall comply with such requirement.
- (3)  A  distress  levied  under  this  section  shall  be  kept  for  ten  days, either  at  the  premises  at  which  such  distress  was  levied  or  at  such  other place as the authorised officer may consider appropriate, at the cost of the person from whom the stamp duty is recoverable.
- (4) If the person from whom stamp duty is recoverable by distress does  not  pay  such  duty  together  with  the  costs  of  the  distress  within  the period of ten days referred to in subsection (3) of this section, the goods and chattels distrained upon shall be sold by public auction for payment of the duty due and payable and all such costs, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied first towards chattels distrained upon, then towards the duty due and  payable  and  any  remainder  of  such  proceeds  shall  be  restored  to  the

(5)  For  the  purpose  of  this  section,  the  provisions  of  the  Civil Procedure Code in relation to distress shall not apply and the Minister shall, by  regulations  published  in  the  Gazette,  provided  for  the  procedure  for distress for the purpose of this section.

83.(1) Where any person being the owner of land or any premises situated in the United Republic fails to make payment of any stamp duty due by him on or before the due date or fails to comply with a notice served on him  under  section  79,  the  Commissioner  may  by  notice  in  writing  notify such person of his intention to apply to the Registrar of Titles for such land or  premises  to  be  the  subject  of  security  for  stamp  duty  of  an  amount specified in the notice.

(2)  If  any  person  on  whom  a  notice  has  been  served  under  this section fails to make payment of the whole of the amount of the stamp duty specified  in  the  notice  within  thirty  days  of  the  date  of  the  service  of  the notice, the  Commissioner may by notice in writing direct the Registrar of Titles that the land or building, to the extent of the interest of such person therein, be the subject of security for stamp duty of a specified amount, and the  registrar  shall  without  fee,  register  such  direction  as  if  it  were  an instrument of mortgage over or charge on, as the case may be, such land or premises and thereupon such registration shall subject to any prior mortgage or charge operate while it subsists in all respects as a legal mortgage over or charge on such land or premises to secure the amount of the stamp duty.

(3) The Commissioner shall, upon the payment of the whole of the amount of the stamp duty secured under subsection (2) of this section  by notice in writing to the Registrar of Titles cancel the direction made under that subsection and the Registrar shall, without fee, record such cancellation and thereupon such direction shall cease to subsist.

84.(1) In addition to any other powers of collection of stamp duty provided in this Act, the Commissioner may in any case where stamp duty recoverable  by  suit  has  been  charged  on  any  person  who  carries  on  the business  of  ship-owner,  charterer  or  air  transport  operator,  issue  to  the proper officer of Customs by whom clearance may be granted a certificate containing the name of such person and the amount of the stamp duty due and payable and on receipt of such certificate the proper officer of Customs shall refuse clearance from any port or airport in the United Republic to any ship or aircraft owned by such person until such duty has been paid.

(2) No civil or criminal proceedings shall be instituted or maintained against the proper officer of Customs or any other authority in respect of a refusal of clearance under this section, nor shall the fact that a ship or aircraft is detained under this section affect the liability of the owner, charterer or agent to pay harbour or airport dues and charges for the period of detention.
