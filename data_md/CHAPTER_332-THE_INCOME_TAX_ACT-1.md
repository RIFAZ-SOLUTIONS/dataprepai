Cash basis accounting

Accrual basis accounting

22. Subject to this Act, a person who accounts for income tax purposes on a cash basis -.

- (a) derives  an  amount  and,  therefore,  shall  include the amount in calculating the person's income or otherwise account for the amount as required by this Act  when  payment  is  received  or  made available to the person; and
- (b) incurs  expenditure  and,  therefore,  may  deduct the expenditure in calculating the person's income or otherwise account for the expenditure as required by this Act when payment is made.
- 23.-( 1)    Subject  to  this  Act,  a  person  who  accounts for income tax purposes on an accrual basis-
- (a) derives an amount when it is receivable by the person; and
- (b) incurs expenditure when it is payable by the person.
- (2) Subject to this Act, an amount is receivable by a person when the person becomes entitled to receive it, even if  the  time  for  discharge  of  the  entitlement  is  postponed  or the entitlement is payable by instalments.
- (3)  Subject to this Act, an amount shall be treated as payable  by  a  person  when  all  the  events  that  determine liability have occurred and the amount of the liability can be  determined  with  reasonable  accuracy,  but  not  before economic performance with respect to the amount occurs.
- (4) For purposes of subsection (3), economic performance occurs -
- (a) with  respect  to  the  acquisition  of  services  or property, at the time the services or property are provided;
- (b) with respect to the use of an asset, at the time the asset is used; or

- (5)        Where  in  calculating  income  on  an  accrual basis -
- (a)
- a person  includes  a  payment  of  a  particular quantity to which the person is entitled or deducts

Claim of right

Reverse of amounts including bad debts Act No. 2 of 2014 s.34

a payment of a particular quantity that the person is obliged to make; and

- (b) subsequently  that  entitlement  or  obligation  is satisfied  by  a  payment  received  or  made  by  the person, as the case requires, of a different quantity,  including  by  reason  of  a  change  in currency valuations,

then  appropriate  adjustments  shall  be  made  at  the  time  the payment is received or made so as to remedy the inaccuracy.

- 24. For  purposes of sections 22 and 23, an amount shall  be  treated  as  derived  or  expenditure  incurred  by  a person notwithstanding that the person is not legally entitled to receive the amount or liable to make the payment, if the person  claims  to  be  legally  entitled  to  receive,  or  legally obliged to pay the amount.
- 25.(1)  Where a person has deducted expenditure in calculating the person's income and the person later recovers  the  expenditure,  the  person  shall,  at  the  time  of recovery, include the amount recovered in calculating the person's income.
- (2) Where  a  person  has  included  an  amount  in calculating  the  person's  income  and,  because  of  a  legal obligation to do so, the person later refunds the amount, the person  may,  at  the  time  of  refund,  deduct  the  amount refunded in calculating the person's income.
- (3)  Where in calculating income on an accrual basis a  person  deducts  expenditure  that  the  person  shall  be obliged to make and the person later disclaims an obligation to incur the expenditure, the person shall, at the time  of disclaimer, include  the amount  disclaimed  in calculating the person's income.
- (4)   Subject to the provisions of subsection (5), where in calculating income on an accrual basis a person includes an  amount  to  which  the  person  is  entitled  and  the  person later-

- (b) in  the  case  where  the  amount  constitutes  a  debt

Long-term contracts claim of the person, the person writes off the debt as bad,

- (5)  A person may disclaim the entitlement to  receive an amount or write off as a bad debt claim of the person -
- (a) in the case of a debt claim of a financial institution, after the debt claim has become a bad debt as determined in accordance with the relevant standards established by the Bank of Tanzania and that such institution has taken all reasonable steps in pursuing payment and the institution reasonably believes that debt claim will not be satisfied; and
- (b) in any other case, only after the person has taken all  reasonable  steps  in  pursuing  payment  and  the person reasonably believes that the entitlement or debt claim will not be satisfied.
- 26.(1)  In the case of a person accounting for income tax purposes on an accrual basis, amounts to be included or deducted  in  calculating  income  that  relate  to  a  long-term contract  shall  be  taken  into  account  on  the  basis  of  the percentage  of  the  contract  completed  during  each  year  of income.
- (2)  The percentage of completion shall be determined by comparing the total expenditure allocated to the contract and incurred before the end of the year of income with the estimated total contract expenditure as determined at the time of commencement of the contract.
- (3)  Where for the year of income in which a long-term contract  is  completed,  the  person  has  an  unrelieved  loss determined  under  section  19  for  the  year  of  income  or  a previous year of income that is attributable to the long-term contract, the Commissioner may allow the loss to be-
- (a) carried back to a previous year of income; and
- (b) treated as an unrelieved loss for that year.
- (4) The  amount  treated  as  an  unrelieved  loss  for  a year of income under subsection (3)(b) shall not exceed the amount by which amounts included in calculating income for

that  year  of  income  under  the  contract  exceed  deductions under the contract for the year.

- (5) An unrelieved loss for a year of income shall be attributable to a long-term contract to the extent that deductions in calculating the income from the business that relate  to  the  contract  exceed  inclusions  in  that  calculation that relate to the contract.
- (6) For  purposes of this section, "long-term contract'-
- (a) means a contract for manufacture, installation, or construction, or, in relation to each, the performance  of  related  services,  which  is  not completed  within  the  year  of  income  in  which work under the contract commences; but
