## 3.2.2 Currency for payments

Although  the  tax  returns  are  filed  in  United  States  Dollar  (USD)  and  translated  to Tanzanian  Shilling  (TZS),  the  tax  assessment  is  issued  in  Tanzanian  Shilling  (TZS). Accordingly, the charge/tax liability created by the system is in Tanzanian Shilling (TZS).

Thus, bank instructions for settling tax payments have to quote the amount in Tanzanian Shilling (TZS). This will ensure that an identical amount settles an identical charge/tax liability and that the amount paid in not held up in suspense.
