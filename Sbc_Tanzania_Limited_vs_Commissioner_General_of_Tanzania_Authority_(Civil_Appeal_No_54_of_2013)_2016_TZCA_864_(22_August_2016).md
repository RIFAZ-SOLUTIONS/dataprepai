## RULING OF THE COURT

16th   February, &amp; 22n d  August, 2016

## OTHMAN, CJ.

In  view  of the  record  of appeal,  in  which  is  attached  a  copy  of the decree signed only by the Chairman of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal, the  point  of  taw  raised  by  the  Court, suo motu, was  whether  or  not  the decree was proper or defective, respectively, rendering the appeal, competent or incompetent.

Mr.  Felix Haule,  learned Advocate for the respondent squarely relying on Midcom  Tanzania  Limited  v.  Commissioner  General  Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No.  13 of 2011 and  Mbeya Intertrade Company Limited v. The Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  68"A" of 2010 (All CAT,  unreported) submitted  that  as  required  under  Rule  21  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  Rules,  2011  (the  Rules)  the  decree  contained  in  the  record  of appeal should  have been signed  by all  members of the Tribunal who heard the  appeal.  As  it  was only signed by  the  Chairman,  it  was  defective, rendering the appeal incompetent.  He invited us to strike it out with costs.

In  reply,  Mr.  Wilbert  Kapinga,  learned  Advocate  for  the  appellant submitted that the appellant was appealing against both the decision  and decree  of the  Tribunal.  That  Rule  21  did  not  require  that  the  decree  be signed by the members. It only required the decision to be signed by them.

Midcom  Tanzania  Ltd. and Mbeya  Intertrade  Company  the  Ltd. cases were clearly distinguishable as they concerned  non-compliance with Rule  21  governing  decisions.  That  rule  was  silent  on  the  signing  and certification of a decree by the members.

Mr.  Kapinga, however, conceded that it was implied under Rule 23(2) that a  decree should be signed and certified by all the members who heard the  appeal.  The  point  of  law  was  therefore  sustainable  under  Rule  23(2) and  not  Rule  21.  He  yielded  that  the  decree  having  been  signed only by the Chairman, was defective and it rendered the appeal incompetent.

In view of  the application, mutatis  mutandis, of  the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, Cap.  141  R.E.  2002 and the Court of Appeal Rules, 2009 to appeals emanating from the Tax Appeals Tribunal to the Court of Appeal, a valid  decree  of the Tribunal  is  in  our considered  view  to  be  crowned  with utmost importance as one of the essential documents in an appeal against a decision of the Tribunal.  Both  Rule 96 (1) (h) and 96 (2) (e) of the Court of  Appeal  Rules,  2009  lists  a  decree  as  one  of  the  primary  documents required in a  record of appeal.  Mr.  Kapinga was therefore correct in saying that the appellant was appealing against both the decision and the decree of the Tribunal.

According to section  18(1) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap. 408 R.E. 2010 (the Act) proceedings before the Tribunal are judicial proceedings.  Rule  14(1)  provides  that three  members  of the Tribunal,  of whom  one  shall  be  Chairman  or  the  Vice  Chairman  shall  constitute  the

quoram for the proceedings.  Rule  17(3) stipulates that the  record of every proceeding  of  the  Tribunal shall be signed by  the Chairman  or  Vice Chairman  and  the  members  present.  The  members' joint  responsibly  for signing and duly certifying, is  further  reinforced  in  Rule  21  governing  a decision of the Tribunal. It reads:

"Rule 21. After the conclusion of the hearing of the evidence  and submissions of  the  parties the Tribunal  shall, as  soon as  practicable, make  a decision in the  presence of  the  parties or  their advocates or representatives and shall cause a copy duly signed and certified by the members of the Tribunal  v/hich  heard the  appeal to  be  served on each party to the proceeding"(Emphasis added).

Rule 23 on execution of a decision of the Tribunal states:

"23 (1) The decision  of the  Tribunal shall be enforced by making  application  to  the  Tribunal which  shall issue  a  decree  or order authorizing execution. (Emphasis added).

## In Midcom Tanzania  Limited and Mbeya  Intertrade  Company

Limited cases the Court read  into  Rule 21 the  requirement that as in the case  of the  decision,  the  order  or  decree  of the Tribunal  must equally  be signed  by  the  members  who  heard  the  appeal.  When  we  asked Mr. Kapinga  whether  he  was  inviting  us  to  depart  from  those  decisions,  he chose  instead  to  bank  on  Rule  23(1)  on  the  defectiveness  of the  decree, which he  graciously  admitted. Going by  those  decisions, which  form precedent, we find that the decree signed only by the Chairman was invalid in terms of Rule 21.

Furthermore, considering the scheme of the Act, the entire reading of the relevant Rules and adopting a purposive approach to the interpretation of Rule  23(1),  in  our  respective view,  the  framers  of the  Rules  could  only have  intended  that the  persons  vested  with  authority  to  sign  the  decree that  is  to  be  issued  by  the  Tribunal  thereunder  was  meant  to  be  the members who heard the appeal.

Both section 3 of the Act and  Rule 3 defines the Tribunal as "the Tax Appeals Tribunal  established  under  section  8  (1)".  That  section  provides: "There  shall  be  established  a  Tribunal  to  be  known  as  the  Tax  Appeals

Tribunal".  Rule 3  defines a  member of the Tribunal  as the Chairman,  Vice

Chairman  and the  members of the Tribunal  appointed  in  accordance  with section  8(2)  of the Act,  (See also section  3   of the Act).  It is the  members prescribed  under  section  8(2)  who  compose  the  Tribunal  and  who  have jurisdiction  to  hear  and  determine  appeals.  In  our  considered  view,  that they  were  the  ones  intended  to  sign  a  decree  arising  from  their  own decision  and  issued  by the Tribunal  under  Rule  23(1)  also  as  a  matter  of construction  flows  from  an  equal  prior  duty  that  they  have  to sign the records  of  every  meeting  of  the  Tribunal  under  Rule  17(3),  to sign the decision  in  which  they  heard  the  appeal  under  Rule  21,  as  well  as  the decree  or  order  thereof  as  held by  the  Court  in Midcom  Tanzania Limited and Mbeya Intertrade Company Limited cases.

Another reason fortifies our views. Borrowing from the Civil Procedure  Code,  Cap.  33  R.E.  2002,  which  according  to  section  24(3)  of the Act read together with  Rule 23(2) applies to the execution of a decree of the Tribunal, in our considered opinion, the signing of the decree by the members of the Tribunal  who  heard the appeal  rests on  sound  reason  as they are the best persons to ensure that the decee  has been  drawn  up  in accordance  with  the  decision  they  rendered  under  Rule  21(See, Ndwaty

Philemon  Ole  Saubul  v,  Solomon  Ole  Saibul, Civil  Appeal  No.  68  of 1998 (CAT, unreported).

As  pertinently  stated  by  the  learned  authors,  B.M.  Prasad  and  M . Mohan,  in THE  MU,  MANUAL OF THE CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE, Vol I,  15t h Ed. p.30:

"Unless and until decree is formally drawn up in terms of the  Judgment, there  can  neither  be  an  appeal  nor execution

Before  we  conclude  and  given  the  issues  raised,  in  our  respectful view,  the  Rules,  promulgated  in  2001  urgently  need  to  be  updated  and revised,  in  particular  on  the  signing  and  certification  of the  proceedings, decision,  decree  or  order  of the  Tribunal;  the  delegation  of some  of the judicial  functions of the  members to the  Registrar;  and  the certification  of the  instruments and  records of the Tribunal.  Moreover,  they also ,need  to be closely harmonized with the Appellate Jurisdiction Act and the  Court of Appeal Rules.'

In  the  result and  for  the  above  reasons,  we  are  constrained  to  find which  we  hereby do,  that the decree  in  the  record  of appeal  is defective,

which  renders the  purported appeal  incompetent. Accordingly,  we  uphold the point of law raised and proceed to strike out the appeal.

As the point of law was raised  by the Court, suo motu, we  make  no order as to costs.

Ordered accordingly.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 23r d  day of February, 2016.
