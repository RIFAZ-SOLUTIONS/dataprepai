## EXCHANGE OF NOTES TO THE 1973 TREATY

I

Excellency,

I have the honour to refer to the Protocol signed today at Rome amending the Convention between Italy and Tanzania for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, and Protocol, signed at Dar-Es-Salaam on 7th March, 1973 and to propose on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Italy that the two Governments shall agree:

- hat, with reference to Article 3 of the said Protocol: (a) t
- (i) profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of aircraft in international traffic shall not be subject to any local income tax imposed in the other Contracting State;
- (ii) when a Contracting State determines the profits derived from the operation of ships in international traffic by a percentage of the gross amount derived by an enterprise from transporting passengers or freight embarked in that State, this percentage shall not exceed 2 percent of said gross amount;
- (iii) if the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania concludes an Agreement with any other OECD country giving a treatment of shipping profits more favourable than that fixed by Article 3 of the above-mentioned Protocol and this Exchange of letters, the two Governments shall consult each other in order to extend the same treatment of Italy. The Government of Tanzania shall inform the Government of Italy about any new Agreement with OECD countries, which fixes the said more favourable treatment, as soon as possible;
- (b) that, with reference to Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Convention, the rate of 15 percent mentioned therein shall be reduced to 12.5 percent;
- (c) that, with reference to Article 8 of the said Protocol, the tax imposed in a Contracting State on management fees paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall not exceed 20 percent of such management fees.

I have furthermore the honour to propose that the present Note and Your Excellency's reply confirming the acceptance by the Government of Tanzania of the above proposals shall be regarded as constituting an agreement between the two Governments concerning the matters above mentioned.

I avail myself of this opportunity to extend to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.

Mario Mondello
