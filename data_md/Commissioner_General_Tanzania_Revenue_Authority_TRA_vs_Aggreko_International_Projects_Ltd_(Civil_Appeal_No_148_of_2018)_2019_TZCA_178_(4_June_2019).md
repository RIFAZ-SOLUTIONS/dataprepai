## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

7t h  June &amp; 4t h  July, 2019

## KOROSSO. 3.A.:

The  appeal  before  the  Court  arises  from  a  decision  of  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  (the  Tribunal)  dated  25t h   July  2018  in  Tax Appeal  No.  27 of 2016.  The appellant is the Commissioner General of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). TRA is a Revenue Authority established under Section 4 of the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act Cap 399 R.E. 2006, with  a  duty to assess,  collect and account for Government revenue in the

country. The  present appeal  arises from the fact that TRA is involved  in a tax  dispute  with  the  respondent,  Aggreko  International  Projects  Ltd.  who operate in Tanzania as a  branch of Aggreko International  Projects Limited, a  company  registered  in  the  United  Kingdom,  engaged  in  generation  of emergency/temporary power (electricity), and working mainly with Tanzania  National  Electricity  Supply  Company  Limited  (TANESCO)  as  the main customer.

The nature of the respondents' operations in Tanzania is centered on demand for emergency  power,  and  administrative functions  are executed by  the  head  office  situated  in  Dubai,  United  Arab  Emirates.  Records  of proceedings at the  Board  and the Tribunal  as contained  in the  records of appeal,  reveal that between the years 2011 to 2012, the respondent head office,  provided a  number of services on behalf of the respondent and the cost  of  these  services  was  allocated  to  the  respondent.  The  respondent paid  management  fees  to  the  head  office  for  services  rendered  on  its behalf  by the  head  office.  In  the  financial  year  2013-2014,  the  appellant (that  is  TRA)  conducted  an  audit  on  the  respondent's  tax  affairs  for  the years of income 2011 and 2012. Audit findings led the appellant to form a view that the  respondents' head  office costs are  part of the  management

fees attributed to the respondents' operations in the country and consequently subject to withholding tax.

With these audit findings, the appellant proceeded  to issue a withholding tax certificate to the respondent demanding for a total of Tshs. 2,220,852,775/-  where  Tshs.1,614,442,557/-  being  the  principal  tax  and Tshs. 606,410,218/- as interest thereto arising from management fees paid by the respondent for service rendered from non-resident service providers.  Upon  being  served  with  the  said  certificate,  the  respondent, dissatisfied with the assessments of withholding tax on  management fees, objected to the assessment but the appellant confirmed the assessments, arguing  that  it was  a  correct  reflection  of the  situation  and  the  law.  The respondent was aggrieved by this decision and lodged an appeal before the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  and  the Board upheld  the assessment by the appellant.  Being aggrieved by the decision of the Board the  respondent did  not stop there and  proceeded to file an  appeal  before the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  (the  Tribunal)  where  his  appeal  was allowed.

When  considering  the  respondent's  appeal  against  the  appellant withholding  tax  assessment,  the  Board  held  that  payments  made to  non-

residents for services performed outside  Tanzania have  a source in Tanzania hence  subject  to  withholding  tax and  that  for income  tax purposes  the  income  will  have  a  source  in  Tanzania  if  its  base  is  in Tanzania.  When  the  second  appeal  went  before  the  Tribunal, issues considered included the import of our decision in Commissioner General (TRA) vs Pan African Energy, Civil Appeal No.  146 of 2015 (unreported) where this Court considered  section  69(i)(i)  of the ITA,  2004  implications and stated that;

"Section 69(i)(i) does not impose a  liability on  an individual  company  to  withhold tax  where  service fee is paid in  relation  to  services rendered out of the  United  Republic  regardless  of  the  fact  that payment is made by a company registered in and is doing business in Tanzania

The  Tribunal  held  that  it  was  bound  by  this  decision  and  that  in essence  the appellant (then) had no obligation to withhold tax on payments  made  as  management  fees  for  services  rendered  by  its  head office  offshore.  This  meant that the Tribunal  reversed the  decision  of the Board  finding  in  favour  of  the  respondent  (in  the  current  appeal).  It  is against  the  Tribunal's  decision  that  this  appeal  is  now  before  this  Court having been filed by the appellant dissatisfied with the said decision.

The  memorandum  of  appeal  sets  out  three  grounds  of  appeal challenging the decision of the Tribunal, namely:

- 1.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law by holding  that the payments made by the respondent to non-residents  for  services  performed  outside  Tanzania have  no  source  in  Tanzania  hence  no  withholding  tax payable.
- 2.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that the Appellant was wrong in law to impose interests on the Respondent.
- 3.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law by disregarding the correct position of the law as contained in decision of  this Court in the case of Tullow Tanzania BV versus  Commissioner General, Civil Appeal No. 24 of  2018.

The appellant and  the  respondent counsel  filed  written  submissions for and against the appeal respectively in compliance with Rule 106(1) and subrule  (8)  of the Tanzania  Court  of Appeal  Rules  2009  (the  Rules)  and which  were  during  the  hearing  of  the  appeal  adopted  by  each  counsel subsequently.  On  the  date  of  hearing,  the  appellant  was  represented  by Mr.  Salvatory  Switi,  Learned  Advocate  and  the  respondent  enjoyed  the services of Mr. Wilson Kamugisha Mukebezi, Learned Advocate.

In  arguing  this appeal,  the  appellant's counsel  with the  leave of the Court proceeded to argue in unison the  1s t  and 3r d  grounds and  proceeded to  submit that  we  find  that the  Tribunal  erred  in  holding  that  payments made  by  the  respondent  to  non-resident  service  providers  for  services performed outside Tanzania have no source in Tanzania hence no withholding tax was payable. The counsel grounded his arguments on the fact that section 83(l)(b) of the ITA, 2004, applicable during the year of income  2011-2012  (the  period  of  the  disputed  assessment),  impose  an obligation to a  resident person who pays service fee which has a source in Tanzania to a non-resident to withhold income tax and remit it to Tanzania Revenue  Authority  (TRA).  Arguing  that  for  proper  construction  of  the principle of this provision it should be read together with section 6(l)(b) of the  ITA,  2004.  The  counsel  for  the  appellant  contended  further that  the combined effect of the two provisions is that,  payment of service fee by a non-resident is subject to withholding tax where it can  be proved that the source is in Tanzania.

It  was  further  submitted  by  the  appellant's  counsel,  that  for  tax purposes,  payments which have a source in Tanzania are dealt with under section  69  of the  ITA,  and  more  relevant for the current matter is section

69(i)(i) of  ITA. The  appellant's counsel submitted  that  whereas  the applicability of section 69(i)(i) of the ITA, 2004 to determine which income has a  source  in Tanzania  is  not doubted, the Court should find erroneous the  interpretation  made  by  the  respondents'  counsel  in  construction  of section  69(i)(i) of ITA,  2004,  saying that, for the income to have a source in  Tanzania  the  rendered  services  must  be  performed  in  Tanzania  solely, and  that  in  the  present  case  since  the  services  were  by  non-resident service providers the respondent had  no duty to withhold tax on  payment for  non-residents.  The  counsel  for  the  appellant  argued  that  the  above construction  by the  respondent on the said  provision  was adopted  by the Tribunal in its deliberation and hence the findings by the Tribunal, and thus the Court should also find that the Tribunal erred.

The  appellant  counsel  contended  that  when  a  non-resident  service provider  provides  service  to  a  non-resident  service  provider,  should  be considered to have supplied or delivered service in Tanzania irrespective of where the service came from. Contending further that applying this to the present  case  where  it  is  a  common  ground  that  non-resident  service provider rendered, supplied, delivered management  services to the respondent in respect of activities conducted by the respondent  in

Tanzania  and  therefore,  under  section  69(i)(i)  of the  ITA,  2004,  the  said service was  rendered  in Tanzania  irrespective of the fact that it was done from outside Tanzania.

The  appellant  counsel  submitted  further  that  while  understanding established  rules of interpretation  of legal  provisions and the  practice that tax  laws  should  be  interpreted  strictly,  it  is  imperative  that consideration must be  made on the  purpose of the Act as  a  whole  so as  not to create absurdity. Arguing that taking a purposive approach, the proper construction of section 69(i)(i) of ITA, 2004 is that, payment of service fee has  a  source  in  Tanzania  if  services  in  respect  of  which  the  payment  is made are rendered  in Tanzania,  a  position  he  prayed the Court to adopt. That  if  this  position  is  adopted  then  the  issue  for  determination  will  be whether the  services  rendered  by the  respondent to  non-resident service provider were rendered in Tanzania. That the Court should be guided by its own decisions, such as the Tullow Tanzania BV case, (supra), where at pg. 11  of  the  Judgment,  the  word  " rendered' was  defined  and  that applying the said interpretation, the phrase "service rendered' in Tanzania means "service supplied' or  " delivered ' in Tanzania.

It  was  further  argued  by  the  appellant's  counsel,  that  since  the services  were  consumed  in  Tanzania  in  line  with  the  holding  in Tullow Tanzania  BV (supra),  the  assumption  should  be  that the  services  were rendered  in  Tanzania,  and  thus  payment  of  service  fees  made  by  the respondent  company  to  non-resident  service  providers  had  a  source  in Tanzania,  meaning  that,  the  respondent  company  have  an  obligation  to withhold  tax  for  such  payment  and  remit the  same  to  TRA  and  pay  the requisite interest arising from delay in payment of accrued tax.

With  regard  to  the  decision  relied  upon  by the Tribunal  in  allowing the  appeal,  that  is,  the  case  of Pan  African  Energy  Tanzania  Ltd (supra),  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  urged  the  Court  to  find  the  said decision  distinguishable  because  the  findings  therein  were  substantially influenced by consideration of various provisions of the Indian Income Tax provisions  which  differ  materially  from  provisions  of  our  tax  laws.  The counsel  further  submitted  that the  holding  on this  issue  found  in Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra) whose respective findings have been reaffirmed  by this Court in Shell  Deep Water TZ BP vs Commissioner General for TRA, Civil Appeal  No.  123 of 2018 (unreported) and found to

be good law, should guide the deliberation and determination of the appeal before the Court.

Addressing the second ground of appeal, the counsel for the appellant argued that this ground addresses the interest payable which  is consequential  from the  principal  tax,  thus  if the first and third  grounds of appeal are allowed,  it should  follow that this ground  be allowed  since the principal tax is subject to interest and  in the  present case, the respondent failed  to  pay  requisite  withholding  tax  for  the  period  of  2011-2012,  and thus the  unpaid  amount  interest  is  also  due.  The  counsel  concluded  with prayers that all grounds of appeal be allowed with costs.

On the part of  the respondent, Mr. Wilson Mukebezi, learned Advocate  in  reply  to  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  counsel  for  the appellant when substantiating the appeal, submitted that all the presented grounds of appeal  are  devoid  of merit and  then  proceeded  to  submit on the  grounds  of  appeal  sequentially.  The  respondent's  counsel  started  by addressing the 3r d ground of appeal by challenging the contention advanced that had the Tribunal  members been  referred to the decision  of this Court in Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra), the Tribunal would  have arrived  at  a  different  decision  from  which  they  had  and  affirmed  the

decision by the Board. The counsel stated that this statement is erroneous because Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra) was decided in July 2018, and by  that  time, the  decision of  the  Tribunal had already been  given. Therefore  there  was  no  possibility  that  the  Tribunal  would  have  had  the opportunity to consider the decision of this Court in Tullow Tanzania  BV case (supra) prior to concluding the matter before them.

We will cogitate this assertion without delay. Having perused through the records of appeal we find that the decision of the Tribunal is dated 25t h July 2018 and that of this Court in Tullow Tanzania  BV case (supra)  is dated  4t h   July  2018.  Therefore  the  argument  by  the  respondent  counsel disputing the assertion by the learned counsel for the appellant is devoid of merit.  Although  at  the  same  time,  perusing  through  the  records  of  the Tribunal  we find  that the Tribunal  were aware of our decision  in Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra) because it is referred to in the Judgment of the Tribunal  as  seen  at  pgs.  211,  216,  218,  219  of  the  record  of  appeal rendering  the  argument  by the  appellant's  counsel  that  had  the Tribunal been  made aware  of the  decision  in Tullow Tanzania  BV case (supra) they  would have  confirmed  the  decision of  the Board, also without substance.

The counsel reminded the Court of the principle that tax statutes are to  be  construed  according  to  clear  words  of the  statute.  Arguing  that  in doing so, a true perspective of the law can  be achieved and thus avoiding a situation which is not contemplated by the legislature when enacting the law.  Expounding  further on this, the learned  counsel,  invited the Court to consider and  determine the  issue drawn,  by first discussing the  import of section 69(i)(i) of the ITA,  2004 stating that the said  provision impose the condition  that  services  must  be  rendered  in  this  country.  The  learned counsel for the respondent, submitted further that taxation is a creature of the  Constitution,  vide  Article  138(1)  of  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania Constitution  1977  (as  amended from time to time),  and  requires that tax should be imposed  through law. The  counsel  argued  that  the  cited provisions by the appellant's counsel, that is section 83(l)(b),  69(i)(i) and Section  6(1),  are  relevant  in  addressing  the  main  issue  for  the  Court's determination in this case and that is, whether the payment made to non­ resident service providers are subject to withholding tax. On their part the respondent prayers were that the Court find that they were not subject to withholding tax as found by the Tribunal.

The  respondent's  counsel  also  invited  the  Court  to  consider  our decision  in Commissioner General  of TRA vs.  Pan  African  Energy, arguing  that  on  their  part,  they  are  of the  view  that  the  decision  in  the Commissioner  of  TRA  vs  Pan  African  Energy (supra)  is  good  law especially how it dealt and addressed the relevant provisions therein which are  the  same  provisions  being  discussed  in  the  present  case.  It  was  the counsel's  contention  that  the  decision  in Tullow  Tanzania  BV's  case (supra)  should  not  be  followed  since  it  is  not  good  law  for the  following reasons:

"i. Because it imported definitions which do not tally the law. The  argument  being that when  you consider the said decision, at page 11 paragraph 3, the  Court attempted to  define  the  word " render" while the law says the person delivering has to be inside Tanzania ; and in this case the problem is with the services rendered in  Tanzania and from outside Tanzania.

ii. That the act of distinguishing  the Pan African Energy  case (supra) without  determining the import of the section ; important to be determined and only stating that the decision was influenced by the Indian Tax Law is not  proper.

- iii. That in deciding the case of Tullow Tanzania BV (supra),  the  Court imported  tax principles  on avoidance  and relied on  decisions  not relevant to the dispute and that this can be seen from a case discussed in section/paragraph 66 including a case

discussing section  66  whilst section  69(i)(i) is  very dear in itself.

iv. When  the Pan  African  Energy  case was decided\  this  Court  went  ahead  and  advised  the Government to change the law as the case in India. That section 3 of the Finance Act, 2016,  amending the  Income  Tax Act,  defines " ' services  rendered". That Tullow's  case (supra)  did not address  this problem.  That the Court Should uphold the law as it was then,  and rely on  the position propounded in the Pan African case (supra) decision since it was correctly decided".

Arguing further that, for section 69(i)(ii) to apply, it is only when the Government is the payer and it is then that the interpretation made by the Board and the appellants counsel applies. That this subsection addresses circumstances where  the  Government  is  the payer  for  the services rendered,  irrespective  of  place  of exercise  rendering  or  forbearance.  He further  submitted  that  in  earlier  versions  of  the  law  prior  to  the  2016

amendments, the word "rendered" was not defined and it is the insertion in  the  amendment  law that gives  rise to the  meaning  subscribed  by the appellant and  not the way  it was,  and  which  should  be  construed  in  the present appeal.

On  the  issue  of interest accrued  advanced  in  2n d   ground  of appeal, the  respondent  counsel  submitted  that the  position  by the Tribunal  was correct  and  thus  prayed  that  the  Court  should  dismiss  the  appeal  and uphold the decision of the Tribunal  and thus the claim for interest has to also fail.

In his brief reply, the  appellant's  counsel reiterated his earlier submissions and  disputed  the  assertion  by the  respondent's counsel  that the  service  provider  must  be  situated  in  Tanzania  and  stated  that  the decision in Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra), there was no consideration of the amended provisions of the law, that had inserted the definition of the word "rendered", and the purpose of the said amendment was  to  cure  the  confusion  which  obtained  at  the  time.  That  when considered  and  constructed jointly,  Section  83(l)(b),  Section  69(i)(i)  and Section  6(1)  of  ITA  2004  expound  that  withholding  tax  is  imposed  on

payment  to non-residents where  the source of payment  is United Republic, also referred to as the "source principle".

We  have  meticulously  considered  the  submissions  and  arguments presented  by  the  learned  counsel  both  in  support  of  and  against  the appeal. We find that the main issue before us for determination is whether or not the Tribunal erred  in  holding that the respondent company had  no obligation  to  withhold  tax  on  payments  made  as  management  fees  for services  rendered  by  its  head  office offshore and  this  being  the case the respondents  were  not supposed to  pay the  interest imposed.  In  effect it falls  on  the  interpretation  of Section  69(i)(i)  of ITA,  2004  and  its import. Consequential to this is whether the respondent is liable to pay interest as per the claims.

At the same time, we are of the view that all the grounds of appeal will be considered and determined in unison having regard to the fact that all the grounds of appeal are centered on the appellant's claim against the respondent company on withholding tax on management fees for services rendered by the respondent's head office offshore and in essence, address interpretation  of section  69(i)(i)  of the  ITA,  2004,  as  read  together  with section 6(l)(b) and 83(l)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

Before  proceeding  any  further,  we  endeavor  into  discussion  of  an important matter we feel  should  be addressed. That is understanding the concept  of  withholding  tax  and  what  it  entails.  We  recognize  that  this matter has been  previously addressed  by this Court and we thus proceed to  adopt  what  was  stated  by  this  Court  in Tullow Tanzania  BV case (supra), that "Withholding tax" is a tax that is required to be withheld  by the  person  making  "payment"  of  certain  amounts  to  another  person  in respect of goods supplied or services rendered to satisfy the recipients' tax liability.

Again, with the understanding that interpretation of provisions in tax matters is very important and having been invited by the counsel for both parties  to  do  this,  where on  the  part of the  appellants' counsel  the  plea was for this Court to  use a  purposive approach, whilst on the part of the respondents we were invited to construct the relevant provisions by use of the plain meaning approach accordingly, we find it is important to venture into a  discussion  of the rules of construction of taxing statutes, especially since  interpretation  of various  provision  of the  ITA,  2004  relevant to  the present case is imperative in the determination of this appeal.

We take leaf from a decision of this Court in Bulyanhulu Gold Mine Limited  vs.  Commissioner  General  (TRA), Consolidated  Civil  Appeal No.  89  and  90  of 2015  (unreported) where they adopted  excepts from  a book, "Income Tax Law in Tanzania Source Book, "DUP" (1996)  Ltd 2000,  cited  at  pgs.  8  and  9  of  the  Judgment  of  this  Court,  disclosing several  rules of construction which we find appropriate to also consider in the present case. These include:

- 1.  The  strict  construction  Rule (KHman  vs. Winkworth (1933)17 TC 569
- 2.  Considering  the Statute as a  whole Rule-  where there is an  irreconcilable  conflict ; in  that,  two provisions  on  the surface appear irreconcilable,  each has to be interpreted in a manner which will not negate the other
- 3. Words of the Statute must be read in context-  The main rule is that,  words and  phrases are to be construed in the sense in  which  they are ordinarily used,  but where  they have a technical meaning in law they must be construed in accordance with that meaning.
- 4. Departure  from  the  literal  construction  of the  statutory language-  The main rule of construing  taxing statutes is that  one  should  look  simply  at  what  is  clearly  said. However, courts may  sometimes  depart  from literal construction,  where such construction leads to an absurd

result which cannot have been contemplated. For instance where  such  literal  construction  can  lead  to  unfair  and highly inequitable results. (AG vs Hallet 2 H &amp; N. 368).

We are also guided by our decision in  Republic vs Mwesige Godfrey  and Another in Criminal Appeal No. 355 of 2014 (unreported), where we stated;

"Indeed it is axiomatic  that  when  the  words  of a statute are unambiguous, "judicial inquiry is complete".  There is no need for interpolations,  lest we stray into the exclusive preserve of  the legislature under the cloak of overzealous interpretation!'

That Court must always presume that what a legislature says in a statute means what it says there.  But went on to also state that:

"But this only holds true  in  the  dearest of cases. Where  there  is  an  obvious  lacuna  or  omission and/or ambiguity the  courts have a duty to  fill in the gaps or dear the ambiguity'

The  respondent counsel  submitted that the decision  by the Tribunal on  interpretation  of section  69(i)(i)  of  ITA,  2004  was  correct  because  it was  centered  in  construction  of  the  provision  in  a  manner  governing interpretation of tax statute that is, by reading the context and construing the meaning in the sense in which they are ordinarily used, as the wording

in this provision is clear, and  it  does  not  impose  obligation  to pay withholding  tax  to  non-  resident  service  providers,  a  position  upheld  by this  Court  in Pan African  Energy case (supra).  On  the  other  side,  the appellant is of the view that, construction of such a provision must be in a manner that preserves  its  purpose.  The appellant's  counsel  implored  the Court to use a purposive approach so as to bring in a reality perspective of the  provision  and  avoid  generating  a  situation  of  absurdity  or  one  not contemplated by the legislature.

At  this  juncture  to  have  an  overview  of  the  gist  of  the  provisions under consideration  it is pertinent to import all the relevant provisions we find relevant to the issue for determination:

Section 6(l)(b) of the Act, which addresses what is chargeable income to a non- resident person, provides thus:

'6(1) Subject  to  the  provision  of sub-section  (2), the  chargeable  income  of a person  for a  year of income from any employment business or investment shall be

(a  ) ............. N/A

(b)  In  the  case  of a  non-  resident  person ; the person's income from the employment ; business or

investment for the year of income,  but only to the extent that the income has a source in  the United Republic."

The import of this provision is that a non-resident person's income is taxable where the income has a source in the United Republic of Tanzania, and thus imposing the "source principle".

Section 83(l)(b) states:

'S. 83-(l) Subject to sub-section (2), a resident person who

- (a) .......... N/A
- (b) Pays a service fee or an insurance premium  with a source  in  United  Republic  to  a  non-resident  person shall withhold income tax from the payment at the rate provided for in paragraph 4(c) of  the First  schedule."

The  import  of this  provision  is  to  foist  obligation  for  withholding  tax  on payments  to  non-residents  to  the  extent  and  only  where  the  source  of payment is in the United Republic of Tanzania.

The other relevant provision is section 69(i)(i) of ITA that provides:

"The  following  payments  have  a  source  in  the United Republic

(a)(h) ......... N/A

- (i)  Payments,  including service fees,  of a  type not mentioned in paragraphs (g) or (h) or attributable to  employment  exercised,  service  rendered  or  a forbearance from exercising employment or rendering service.
- (i) in the United Republic, regardless of  the place of payment, or..."

Section  69  of ITA 2004 expounds on  payment with  a  source  in  the United Republic.  For reasons which shortly shall become apparent we find that we shall apply the purposive approach in construction of the relevant provision in this case finding it more appropriate under the circumstances.

Perusing  through  the  above  provisions,  we  entirely  subscribe  to  the holding  in Tullow Tanzania  BV case (supra), a  position  restated  in  the Shell  Deep Water TZ BP case (supra), there is no doubt in our minds that when  reading  through  sections  6(l)(b),  69(i)(i)  and  83(l)(b)  of ITA 2004,  all  together  gives two  conditions  for  payment to a  non-resident to be  subjected  to withholding tax. These are:  (1) the  service of which  the payment  is  made  must  be  rendered  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania and  (2)  the  payment  should  have  a  source  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania.  This  stance  has  not  been  challenged  by either  counsel  in  this appeal.

The counsel for the  respondent invited the Court to depart from the decision  of this  Court  in Tullow Tanzania  BV (supra)  and  reaffirm  the decision of this Court in Pan African Energy (supra) and also to find the decision  in BP Tanzania vs. The Commissioner for TRA, Civil  Appeal No. 125 of 2015 (unreported), which discussed matters related to withholding  tax  on payment  of  non-resident  service  providers  to  be distinguishable  because  it  addressed  section  69(e)  of  ITA  2004.  The weight of the respondent's counsel arguments is that the Court's interpretation  of  the  provision  should  augur  well  with  the  practice  in interpretation  of Tax  Statutes,  that is,  strict interpretation,  having  regard to  the  content  and  parameters  put  in  the  relevant  provision.  That  the Court  be  guided  by  the  decision  of this  Court  in Pan  African  Energy Tanzania  Ltd (supra)  and  that  in  the  present  appeal,  the  Court should not  depart  from  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal,  since  the  services  being taxed  were  performed  in Dubai  and not  Tanzania,  thus  withholding obligation did not arise in respect of the payments. The appellant's stance differed on this as already expounded hereinabove, finding the holding  in Pan African Energy (supra) to be distinguishable.

We  had  time  to  consider  our  decision  in  the  case  of Pan  African Energy (supra), where  having  considered the provisions of section 6(l)(b), 83(l)(c) and 69(i)(i) of ITA 2004, held that section 69(i)(i) is clear that income  tax  is  chargeable  for  services  rendered  in  Tanzania  and stressing  on  the  words "services  rendered" in  Tanzania  and  construed the  said  provision  not  to  impose  liability on  an  individual  company  to withhold tax where service fee is paid in relation to services rendered out of  the United Republic  of  Tanzania, except  where  the  payer  is  the Government and  then  Section  6(i)(ii)  will  apply.  We  share  the view  that the obtaining  circumstances in the appeal  under consideration  render the said  decision  to  be  distinguishable  because  as  also  held  in  the  case  of Tullow Tanzania  BV (supra)  and Shell  Deep  Water TZ  BP  case (supra), the Court in arriving at the decision in Pan African Energy case (supra)  seem  to  have  been  greatly  influenced  by  cases  and  laws  put before  the  Court  emanating  from  India,  including  the  provisions  of  the India  Income  Tax  law.  Provisions  which  at  the  time  were  not  similar  in context or construction to the relevant provisions in our Tax laws.

The Court in the Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra) was also of the view that the word "rendered" as used under section 69(i)(i) of ITA 2004,

is synonymous to the words "supplied" or "delivered", and thus,  in effect, meaning that a  non-resident person  who  provides services to a  resident, has  delivered/supplied  services  to  a  resident  of  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania.  This  position  was  reaffirmed  in Shell  Deep Water Tanzania BV (supra).

We firmly subscribe to the  position  held  by this Court as expounded in Tullow Tanzania  BV case (supra)  a  position  also  adopted  in Shell Deep  Water  Tanzania  BV (supra)  on  the  issue  of  "the  source"  and "service  rendered" and  also where  it was stated that,  as the  recipient of the service is the actual  payer for such services, the "source of payment" has to  be where the  payer resides.  Applying  the findings from  the cases cited above to the  present appeal, where the management services were conducted  from  Dubai,  by  a  branch  company  situated  in  Tanzania,  the situation  is  similar  in  that the  said  services  were  utilized  or  consumed  in the United Tanzania and thus  without doubt can  be said to be "sourced" in the United Republic of Tanzania.

There being no dispute that for the years 2011-2012, the respondent paid  management fees for service rendered on its behalf by its head office situated  outside  Tanzania,  that  is,  Dubai  and  that  during  the  period  the

respondent was engaged  in operations in Tanzania, we are thus satisfied that the respondent made payment for management services rendered by non-resident service  providers, for services sourced  in Tanzania,  and that this  imposed  a  duty  to  the  respondent to  withhold  tax  on  the  payment made.

In  the  event,  we  find  that  the  1st  and  3r d   ground  of  appeal  are meritorious  and  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  law  by  not  having  a  proper construction  of sections  6(l)(b),  69(i)(i)  and  83(l)(b),  especially the  fact that  read  together,  withholding  tax  is  imposed  on  payment of service  to non- resident service providers.

We think it is  important to also discuss albeit briefly the four issues raised  by the respondent when submitting and imploring this Court to find the decision in Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra) bad in law. We wish to state that the duty of this Court in this appeal was not one of reviewing our decision in Tullow  Tanzania  BV  case (supra), there  are remedies available  under the  Appellate Jurisdiction  Act,  Cap  141  RE  2002  where  a person  aggrieved  by a  decision  of this  Court  may  undertake to  move the Court to review its decision and that was not our task in this appeal before us.

In  the  final  analysis,  having  allowed  the  1 s t   and  3r d   ground  of  the appeal consequential to this is the duty for the respondent to pay interest for the principal sum and for the delay in  payment of commensurate tax. Thus the 2nd ground of appeal has merit and is therefore allowed.

The above said, the appeal is allowed with costs.
