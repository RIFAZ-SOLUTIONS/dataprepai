## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

29 April, 2022 &amp; lgh October,  2022

## LILA, JA:

In this appeal, the appellant KILOMBERO  SUGAR COMPANY LIMITED is faulting  the decision  by the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (TRAT) which sustained the Tax Revenue  Appeals Board's (TRAB) decision that she is liable to pay the respondent  1ZS. 32,006,125.00  being withholding  tax which she ought to have withheld when she effected payment of TZS. 188,000,00.00  to Zambia Sugar Company Limited (ZSCL) for directorate service office for Central Region which is in Zambia. The payment was in

the form of management fees. The instant appeal to the Court is a clear manifestation of dissatisfaction  with the finding.

the year of income 2011 and 2012, the respondent  conducted  an audit, the report of which revealed that the appellant paid TZS. 188,000,00.00 to ZSCL for the directorate service office for Central Region which is in zambia but dld not remit the relevant withholding  tax. Exercising its mandate under section 84 of the Income Tax Act, 2004 (the ITA), the respondent issued  a Withholding Tax Certificate nourying  the appellant her liability No. WHT/IRMDi9/2/2013 in the sum of TZS. 32,006,125.00.  It was not smoothly received by the appellant who challenged  it by preferring an objection which, however, after deliberation,  the respondent was not Appeals Act, the respondent latter issued a notice of confirmation  of assessment requiring  the appellant to pay  the aforementioned amount latest by L0l2l20l7 without fail otherwise an interest shall start to accrue on the said amount. That move triggered institution of an appeal by the appellant to the TRAB in which he advanced four points  of grievances  as hereu nder:It was common ground that upon the appellant filing final returns for inclined  to amend it. Consistent  with section 13 of the Tax Revenue

- "1. That the management seruices for the year of income 2012 were performed  outside Tanzania  (not sourced in the United Republic) are by the provisions  of Section 69(i) of the Income Tax Act, 2004 are not subject of withholding tax.
- 2. That by the provisions of the Double Taxation agreement  (DTA)  between Tanzania  and Zambia, the withholding tax obligation does not arise.
- 3. That since one of the grounds  of appeal in Appeal No. 19 of 2016 which was lodged in the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal on 4 august 2016 is touching the very tax which is subject of this appeal; the Respondentg  decision dated January 10, 2017 is res subjudice.
- 4. That the Resryndent's decision  dated January 10. 2017 is not suppofted by the reasons of the decision as required by law and is therefore in breach of the principles  of natural justice."

Addressing  itself to the issue "whether management fees paid to ZSCL is paft of industrial and commercial  profib" in terms of the Double Taxation Agreement  betvveen Zambia and Tanzania  (the DTA), hence not subject to withholding  tax, the TRAB, after quoting in extenso  Article IV(l) of the DT&amp; observed at  page 295 that:-

'Also looking at the clear words of the provisions  of Article IV(I) of the DTA, the words "industrial and commercial profits" signifies that, the DTA is applicable  only to the ertent where the taxable income relates to industrial and commercial profits. In the present  case, there is no dispute that, Zambia Sugar Company  Limited is incorporated in Zambia, hence is an enterprise and resident of Zambia with no permanent establishment in Tanzania. For that matter, the transactions related to industrial and commercial profits  of ZSCL are not taxable in Tanzania  in terms of the provisions  of Article IV(I) of the DTA."

The TRAB went fufther to state at page 296 that:-

"We think that management fee paid to ZSCL is not part of the industrial and commercial  profits.  In broader perspectivq  one may agree that seruices do form part of taxable income of any enterprise in any part of the world where such seruices are not classifted  as "unearned incomes"  and/or subjected to differential taxes (e.9. specific rates of final withholding taxes). However,  in the present case, reading the clear words used in the provisions  of Afticle IV(I) of the DTA, we frnd the Erm "seruice" not specifically referred to in Article

W(1) of the DTA. Therefore, in our view, the inclusion of  management fees under industial and @mmercial prcfiB is not justified. Also the term profit as defined  by the Oxford Dictionary  means 'b financial gain, especially the deference between the amount eamed and the amount srent in buying, operating or producing something". This means that, all expenses are dducted for total revenues allectd and management fee is simply payment which would be income to a company receiving  it (See Tullow Tanzania BV us. Commissioner General, TRA, Appeal No. 64 of 2013 (unreported). Thereforq  the appellantb  arguments that management seruices form part of industrial and @mmercial profit of ZSCL, a non-resident  enterprise cannot stand. The appellant  was thus obliged to withhold tax on management f* paid to Zambia Sugar Company Limited, We find the appellant?  appeal on the second ground to have no merib and we resolve the first issue affirmatively."

Having lost, the foregoing  finding was not free from criticism by the appellant who preferred  an appeal to the TRAT In Appeal No. 19 of 2016 before which four points of grievances  were a subject for determination. These are:-

\i)  By holding  that Management  fee is not part  of industrial  and commercial  profit; the Honourable Board misinterpreted the meaning of the term industrial and commercial  profrts  as applied in the Double Taxation Agreement between Tanzania  and Zambia;

(i0 Having stated that seruices do form part of taxable income of any enterprise in any paft of the world and therefore subjed to taxes such as withholding  tax, the Honourable  Board ered in law in differentiating  between "services"  and Management fee" by holding that it is not justified to include Management fee under industrial and commercial profits simply because  Article IV(I) of the DTA does not mention the term "seruice".

(iii) The Honourable Board erred in law by relying on the narrow interpretation of the term profit which is provided under the Oxford Dictbnary and in the decision of Tullow Tanzania BV w. commissioner General, TRA in Appeal No. 64 of 2Ol3 which was decided per in curium by the Board."

(4) The Honourable Board ered in law for not considering the Appelantb fundamental and or

## substantial arguments against the decision of the respondent. "

Like the TRAB, the TRAT was convinced that, given the clear wording of Article  IV(l) of the DTA, management  fees is not part of the industrial and commercial  profits envisaged hence, the DTA is inapplicable.  It fufther, based on a persuasive decision in the case of Cape Brady Syndicate vs. Inland Revenue Commissioner  (1921) 1KB 64 that there is no presumption  as to tax, "you read nothing in, you imply nothing" and the case of Tullow Tanzania BV Vs. Commissioner General, TRA (supra) where it was held that Article 7 of the DTA between Tanzania  and South provisions of Afticle IV(1) of the DTA between Tanzania and Zambia are equally inapplicable in the situation obtaining in the present case

Africa which had identical provisions with those in Article IV(l) of the DTA is inapplicable in withholding tax on service fees, the TRAT held that the essentially  because the Article  does not provide for the term "service".

Once again, the appellant was dissatisfied and sought to fault the TRAT decision on a three point memorandum  of appeal. However, at the hearing Mr. Ayoub Mtafya, learned counsel who represented  the appellant, with leave of the Court, abandoned  ground one (1) of appeal. Two points of  grievance  remained  which are:-

"1. That the Honourable  Tax Tribunal erred in law by holding that "management  fee cannot be included  under commercial and industrial profits because the Article  (Article IV of the DTA) does not provide  for the term service and that the terms and conditions  so  provided  in the said Atticle are centered on industrial and commercial profits and not payments  derived by the entity situated in a foreign country.

- 2. That the Honourable Tax Tribunal effed in law and or misinterpreted  the provisions of Atticle IV of the Double Taxation Agreement  between Tanzania and Zambia by holding that the Board was coffed in holding that inclusion of management fee under Industrial and Commercial Profit is not justified as the Atticle is centered  on profits while the instant appeal has nothing to do with profits."

Mr. Ayoub Mtafya, appeared for the appellant, as hinted above whereas Mr. Juma Kisongo and Ms. Consolata Andrew, both learned Principal State Attorneys and Ms. Salome Chambani, learned State Attorney,  joined  forces to represent the respondent  in resisting the appeal.

Amplifying on the grounds of appeal after adopting the written submissions he had lodged earlier as part of his submission, Mr. Mtafya

argued in respect  of both grounds of appeal which he took the view, and rightly  so, in our view, that they are closely related. They are actually inteftwined  or interwoven. Upon our  perusal  of the record of appeal against both written  and oral arguments  before us, we noted that, to a large extent his arguments bore semblance with the arguments and submlssions he lodged before the TRAB and TRAT. A common argument is that both the TRAB and TRAT took a narrow view of the word profit contrary  to its definition in paragraph  4  particularly  Articles  1, 72,73 and 74 of the OECD Commentary  2014 in the Materials on International TP and EU Tax Law by Kees Van Raad which, he stressed, is very important  in the interpretation  of the convention.  It is his further argument that article IV of the DTA covers all types of income as opposed to the view taken by both the TRAB and TRAT that it does not cover or provide the term service.  In his attempt to distinguish income referred  in Article IV(1) and IV(7) of the DT&amp; he contended  that the latter was not considered  by TRAB and TRAT for had they done so, they would have realized that the former covers all types of income while the latter restricts the application of Article IV(1) to a situation where a certain income is taken care of by other articles of the DTA.

Mr. Mtafya also referred  us to section 8(2) of the ITA which defines what is income from business in which service fees is amongst them and section 128(4) of the ITA which imposes a duty to the United Republic, in cases where it is a party to the international agreement  with a provision so requiring, to either exempt a certain income or  payment from being subjected  to  payment  of tax or reduce the amount of tax  payable. Principally,  he was insistent that the management fees paid by the IV(1) of the DTA it was not subject to withholding  tax as it was a payment for management  services by a company with a permanent establishment  in Zambia. appellant  to the ZSCL was a profit from business hence, in terms of Article

The foregoing view was strongly opposed  by Ms. Andrew and Mr. Kisongo who pressed for the Couft to find that Article IV(l) of the DTA does not provide for the term "service"  hence the management  fee paid is chargeable to withholding tax. They referred us to our earlier decision in Kilombero  Sugar Company Limited and the Commissioner General, TRA, Civil Appeal No. 218 of 2019 (unreported) where, at page 23 of the typed  judgment,  this Court interpreted Article 7 of the DTA between Tanzania and South Africa which is similar to article IV of the DTA

between Tanzania and Zambia. In that case, the Coud observed that it does not talk about service fees but business  profits  and concluded  that service fees by a South African entity for provision of  professional  services to withholding  tax under section 83(1)(b) of the ITA. They were not management fee as paft of or inclusive in industrial and Commercial profits.  Neither does it  provide  that service fee is proflt but is included in the person's gains  or profit  from conducting  business,  they argued. The position  was, according to them, properly propounded by TRAB in lts decision  in Tullow Tanzania BV vs Commissioner  General, TRA (supra)  which was later sustained by the TRAT. They impressed  upon the Couft to follow the same route and dismiss the appeal with costs. to a Tanzanian  entity do not form  part  of the business profits  thus subject agreeable with Mr. Mtarya that section 8(2Xa) of the ITA defines

We have examined  the proceedings  in the record of appeal and also given due weight to the rival arguments  by learned brains of both sides before the TRAB, TRAT and the  judgments  thereof and realized that, in both grounds of appeal, the bottom line of their contention  is whether Article  IV(l) of the DTA includes  management (service) fees. With that in mind and in order to have a smooth landing,  we find it compelling  that we

should,  at first, resolve  whether Artlcle IV(l) of the DTA bears any semblance  with Adicle 7 of the DTA between Tanzania and South Africa which was a subject of discussion by the Court in the case of Kilombero Sugar Company  Limited vs Commissioner General, TRA (supra). We shall refer the former agreement as the DTA and the later as DTA-TSA so as to avoid any confusion that may arise. And, for ease of reference,  we quote  them as hereunder:-

Beginning with the DT&amp; Article IV(l) states:-

## "Article IV

- 1. The indus.trial and commercial  profiB of an enterprise of a Contrading Sbte shall be bxable only in that sbte unless the enterprise carries on business  in the other Contrading  State through a Nrmanent  establishment situated therein. If the enfurprise carries on business as aforesaiQ  tax may be imposed in that other Contrading StuE but only on so much of them as is  attributable  to  the  permanent establishment."

And, Atticle 7 of the DTA-TSA provides:-

"Atticle 7

## Business Profits

[Conpare;  OECD Model  /  UN modeu

- 1. The profits  of an enterprise  of a Contrading Sbte shall be taxable only in that state unless the enterprise arries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits  of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable  to that permanent establishment."  [Emphasis addedl

Common in both provisions is the fact that it is the profit from business which is subject to tax. The distinction  appears to be that, while Article  IV(l) of the DTA refers to and is restrictive to profit  from industrial and commercial enterprises,  Article 7(1) of the DTA-TSA refers to profit a wider spectrum of sources of income. Stated in other words,  profib from other sources apaft from industrial and commercial enterprises  are subsets of it and are chargeable to tax. However, substantially in both Articles, it is the profit from the enterprise which is chargeable  to tax. In that context, we have noted no substantial and material differences  between from enterprises irrespective  of the kind or nature. So, the latter catches

the two Afticles save for the scope and the fact that the Contracting  States to which they are applicable  are different. Whether or not we shall accept the invitation by the learned Principal State Attorneys to follow the Courtb interpretation  of article 7(1) of the DTA-TSA  in Kilombero Sugar Company Limited and the Commissioner General, TRA in interpreting  Article IV(1) of the DTA is an issue the discussion of which we reserve  to a later stage in this  judgment.

Reverting  back to the substantive issue raised earlier on, it is crystal clear that the parties are in agreement  that the money paid (TZS. 188,000,000.00)  by the appellant  to ZSCL is income from business of an enterprise, Kilombero Sugar Company Limited which has a  permanent establishment  in Tanzania.  It was paid as management  or service fees. IV(l) of the DTA. We are  justified  to hold so bearing in mind the parties' concurring views in their respective  submissions.  In respect of the appellant.  in the concluding submission  in respect  of article IV of the DTA at  page  4 item 2.2.1, it is stated that:They, too, seem to have a common understanding of the impot of Article

"It  was the ap4lantb  argument that, since the said amount was paid to Zambia Sugar Company Limited, which  is  incorporated  in Zanbia,

withholding  tax or withholding obligations on the appellant does not arise for management  seruices because by the provisions  of Double Taxation Agreement  (DTA) between Tanzania and Zambia the withholding obligation does not arise as industrial and commercial profits of an enterprise of a contracting state shall only be taxable only in that state. "

And, on the part of the respondent,  in unambiguous  words, at page 4 of the reply submission,  it is stated that:-

"When the respondent  conduded  a bx audit for the year 2011 and 2012, came up with some audit findings  among others that the appellant  (who is a resident in Tanzania) had paid to Zambia Sugar Company Linited (a resident in Zambia), a Management Fee amounting  to Tshs. 188,000,000. From the transadion,  the respondent  subjected  the Appellant  to the withholding tax liability  at the sum of Tshs. 32,006,125.00  which was supposed to be withheld and remitted to the Respondent  when the appellant was making payments to zambia Sugar Company Limited for the said Management Fee of Tshs. 188,000,000..."

While it is accepted  by the parties that the  payment made was management fees, the bone of contention between them, as alluded to above, is narrowed  down to be whether or not Aticle IV(l) of the DTA embraces management or service fees hence not subject to withholding tax in Tanzania.  In actual fact, the Court is being called upon to expound the import of Article IV of the DTA. We shall do so while mindful of the principles governing interpretation of tax statutes. Luckily, the Court had an occasion to examine such principles of various  jurisdictions  and was not hesitant  to subscribe to a few of them in the case of Pan African EnetgY Tanzania Ltd vs Commissioner  General, Tanzania Revenue

Authority, Civil appeal no. 81 of 2019 (unreported).  These are:-

- 1. While construing a provision  that creates a righq, the couft must always lean in favour of a construction  that saves the right rather than on which defeats the right...However,  the interpretation should lead only to the logical end; it cannot go to the provision. Full effect should be given to the language used in the pmvision and a rigid or restricted interpretation must be extent of reading something  that is not stated in the

avoided.(see a book on "Law and Practice of Income Tax" by Kanga, Palkhivala  and Vyas Volume  1 ninth Edition pages  26 to 27).

- 2. In taxing clear words are necessary  in order to bx the subjed. Too wide and fanciful construdion  is often given  to that maxim, which does not mean that words are b be unduly restrided againil the Crown, or that there is to be any discrimination  against the Crown in those Acts.  It simply means that in bxing one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no noom for intendment There is no equity about tax. There is no presumption  as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied..,fsee the case of Capebrandy  Syndicate vs Inland Revenue Commissionerc  [1921]  1 KB 641.
- 3. The statutes  enaded for imposition and collection of income tax must be strictly @nstrued. "[see the case of Charles Herbert withers Brothers- Payne vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, Civil Appeal No.55 of 1968 EACA (unreported). (Emphasis added)

Guided by these principles and attaching the words their literal meaning since they are unambiguous, we find ourselves constrained  to

agree with the obseruation made by the TRAB and upheld by the TRAT on the context of Article IV(l) of the DTA. The TRAB, at page 10 of its judgment  found at page 295 of the record of appeal stated that:-

"In the light of the provisions of article IV(I) of the DTA, the industrial and commercial profits  of an enterprise of a Contacting State is taxable only in that State, that is in the country which the enterprise  is resident.  Where the enterprise  carries on business in that other Contrading  State through a permanent  establishment it will be taxable in that other Contrading  State in which it is resident."

That is, indeed, in our considered  view, the proper import of Afticle IV(l) of the DTA. That notwithstanding,  absence  of the word "service", was an issue to which the parties pafted ways whether or not that Article is applicable  in the  present  situation.  Without  mincing words, we entirely agree with the learned Principal State Attorneys  and even Mr. Mtafya did not suggest otherwise, that the word "service" is not reflected in that aticle.  However, the article makes reference  to industrial  and commercial profits. What then this entails? In the statement  of appeal to the TRAB, the appellant presented herself as a company involved  in the business of production and sale of sugar. As to how it generates profits, the TRAB

deduced the meaning of profit from Oxford Dictionary and observed, and in our view rightly so, that profit is a "financial gain, especially the difference between the amount earned and the amount spent in buying, operating or producing something. This means that, all expenses  are deducted  from the tobl revenue!'.In our further view, that ought not to have been the end of it. In order to resolve whether the Aticle ought to have expressly indicated the word "service" the TRAB and TRAT ought to have gone further to consider what is meant by income from business.  On this, we are persuaded by the explanation of the word business  provlded  at page 128 of the book INCOME TAX IN TANZANIA by Paul Joseph published in 1990 that:-

"Business  comes under different  forms and guises. The term business can be comfoftably applied to describe oommercial  speculative venfune4  a concern, a co-operative, a joint  venture,  a barter or an exchange of gods or commodities, a single or isolated transaction,  a merchandising or marketing enterprise and a host of other transactions in the naturc of a business, where buying and selling of goods or providing of services play an important role." (Emphasis  added).

It may be discerned,  therefore, that business  is a commerclal  venture and it is not restricted to sale or exchange of goods  only but it extends to provision  of services  for gain  or profit. For this reason, the author  goes further to state that:-

"In a market economy, business may be described as the purchase  and sale of goods motivated  with achieving  a gain or profit.

In the word of commerce  it may mean a person, a paftnership,  a co-operative, a parasbbl, a corporation  or a limifud ampany engaged in commefioq in trade or manufacturing  or ptoviding of a service, the motive always being profit,...in  one way or ol:lter will be subject b  the income bx laws identified under business income.  lEmphasis  added)

Without implying or involving ourselves in intendment  and giving the words their literal meaning, it is plain therefore that business includes provision  of service for gain  or profit and the latter is a commercial transaction  motivated  by obtaining a profit. Stated  simply,  provision  of service for gain  or profit is a commercial transaction.  Hence, the word "service" is embraced  in the phrase  "commercial  profit".  We would add that it would be demanding too much if we are to expect articles of this

nature to state each and every kind of business, business undedakings which generate profit subject to tax and also include every word. Others are matters  that are deducible from the article when read in its context. The afticles are couched in a general form so as to accommodate other matters  having a bearing with it. Ultimately, since the word commercial  is reflected in Article IV(l) of the DTA, the argument  by the learned  Principal Attorneys that it does not embrace  the word "service"  falls apart. For this reason, ground one of appeal succeeds.

Now, applying Article IV(l) of the DTA to the instant case, it seems obvious to us that the appellant  paid service fees (management  fees) to the ZSCL, which, applying the source and residence tests, would be subject to withholding tax in Tanzania  under sections 6(1Xb),  69(iXD and 83(1Xb) of the ITA not only because the appellant is a company resident in Tanzania but also because the income  paid  to ZSCL has a source in Tanzania.  Luckily,  it has never been an issue that the source of income paid  to ZSCL is Tanzania,  the services  were rendered in Tanzania  and the payer is a company resident in Tanzania. Such is the stance we took in the unreported  case of Tullow Tanzania BV vs The Commissioner

## General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 24 of 2018. For

clarity, we take pains  to recite the relevant part of that decision thus:-

"Reading sedions  6(1Xb) 69(i)(i) and 83(1)(b), all together gives two conditions  for payment  to a nonresident to be su\ed tu withholding  tax. These are: (1) the seruices of which the payment  is made must be rendered in the united republic of Tanzania, and (2) the payment should have a source in the United Republic  of Tanzania.

The withholding obligation under sedion 83(1Xb) of the Act applies to a payment  for seruice fee with a source in the United Republic of Tanzania  and section 69 stipulates what payment have a source in the united Republic  of Tanzania.

It is our strong view that the word rendered used under section 69(i)(0 is synonymous  to words "supplied" or "delivered". In this regar{ a nonresident who provides seruices to a resident has delivered/supplied services to a resident of the united Republic  of Tanzania. The recipient of the service is actually  the payer for such seruices, in which case, "source of payment"  cannot be any other  place except where the payer resides. In other words as the services of which payments were made were consumed or utilized by the

appellant  in the United  Republic of Tanzania for purposes  of earning income in the United republic, then payments made for such services had a source in the United republic  of Tanzania and the respondent had to withhold tax under sedion 83(1)(c) of the Act."

Given the above legal position,  the service fees paid by the appellant to the ZSCL would be subject to withholding  tax in Tanzania and the appellant  would have the obligation  to withhold tax. Such would also be the situation in zambia as ZSCL would receive such an amount as an income thereby  subjecting the same income to double Taxation  hence the introduction of Double Taxation Relief Agreements (DTA). Principally,  the agreements are intended to give tax relief to tax payers in such occurrences. The issue in the instant case would then be is the DTA of any assistance?

In the present case, Article IV(l) of the DTA, in very clear terms provides  that the industrial and commercial  profits of an enterprise  of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that state unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. The appellant, as we have said it repeatedly,  is resident in Tanzania, carries on business in Tanzania and has

no permanent establishment in Zambia. Hence it had an obligation to withhold tax. The assetion that the service fees paid to ZSCL is not subject to withholding  tax is therefore misplaced. The situation would be different if the appellant carried business in Zambia through a  permanent obligation  to withhold tax on the payment  for services rendered in Tanzania thereby subjecting itself to tax in Zambia in terms of Article  IV(l) of the DTA. The rationale  behind  is that such  payment  would amount to income in Zambia hence be, again, subjected to tax. For, once such payment is taxed in Tanzania  on account  of the residence and source test, the same payment would be taxed again thereby rendering  the DTA redundant. It is then when Article )0/I (1) of the DTA would come into play and exclude the tax withheld by the appellant  in the determination  of tax payable  by ZSCL in Zambia to which the management (service) fees paid fails and is dismissed. establishment situated  in Zambia  whereby it would be exempted from the will amount to an income subject to tax. Ground two (2) of appeal thereby

Just in passing, Mr. Mtafya had tried to impress  the Court that it is important  to have resort to the provisions  of the OECD Commentary 2014 every time we are faced with the problem  of interpreting  the articles

of the DTA. We think he would be true only to the extent of offering assistance  in situations  where the provisions of a given DTA are unclear. This was not the case in the present matter.

We lastly consider the invitation by the learned Principal State Attorneys that we should not depart from the position taken by the Court in the case of Kilombero Sugar Company Limited vs Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority  (supra).  We have read the decision and realized that it was decided in its own context quite unrelated to issues before us in the instant appeal. In that case, presence or absence of the word "service" in the DTA between  Tanzania  and South Africa was not an issue as opposed to the instant  case where it formed the crux of the case. Added to that, the meaning of the term "profit" in relation to costs incurred in the provision of services, constituted a significant discussion by the Court in that case which is not the case herein. Save for the fact that in both cases the appellant  has a legal obligation  to withhold tax and remit the same to the respondent, we find no material bearing between the two cases. Accordingly, the invitation ls hereby rejected.

All said, the appeal partly succeeds in that article IV(1) of the DTA embraces service fees paid by industrial and commercial  enterprises.

Otherwise  the appeal fails and the finding by both tribunals  (the TRAB and TRAT) that the appellant  had a liability to withhold tax and remit it to the respondent  is sustained. The appellant wrongly paid service or management  fee (TZS, 188,000,000.00)  to ZSCL without honouring her legal obligation to withhold tax and remit the same to the respondent.  The latter, therefore,  properly issued to the appellant  a notice for  payment  of the same. In view of the appeal is partly successful, we order each party  to bear lts own costs.
