## RULING OF THE COURT

22n d  &amp; 29th  July, 2020

KEREFU. J.A.:

This  ruling  is  in  respect of the application  for  review  lodged  by the applicant  inviting  the  Court  to  review  its  own  decision  dated  24t h   June, 2019  in  Civil  Application  No. 177/20  of  2019  dismissing  the  applicant's application for being misconceived. The application is made under section 4 (4)  of the  Appellate Jurisdiction  Act,  [Cap.  141  R.E  2019]  (the  AJA)  and

Rules 66 (1) (a) and (b) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009 (the Rules).

The  notice  of  motion  is  supported  by  an  affidavit  which  was  duly sworn  by  Mr.  John  Daniel  Kamugisha,  learned  counsel  for  the  applicant. The respondent, on the other hand/  opted not to file an affidavit in reply.

A brief background of this application as gathered from the record is to the  effect that,  the  applicant was  dissatisfied  with  the  decision  of the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  (Twaibu,  J.)  dated  9t h   July,  2015  in  Tax Appeals  No.  128 of 2013  hence she  lodged  Civil  Appeal  No.  144 of 2018 which  is still  pending  before  the  Court.  In  addition,  the  applicant  lodged Civil  Application  No.  177/20  of  2019  under  Rule  4  (2)  (a)  of  the  Rules seeking to  be granted  leave to adduce additional  evidence  in Civil Appeal No.  144 of 2018.  At the  hearing  of the said application, the Court invited the  parties  to  address  it  on  its  propriety  after  noting  that  it  was  not predicated  under  Rule  36  (1)  (b)  of the  Rules  which  is  the  specific  Rule regulating the modality of parties applying to adduce additional evidence in respect  of  an  appeal  pending  before  the  Court.  In  his  submission,  M r. Kamugisha,  who  was  representing  the  applicant  argued,  among  others,

that  the  application  was  of  peculiar  nature  and  has  been  brought  in  a separate  application under  Rule  4  (2) (a) of  the Rules  because  the impugned decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the TRAT) was not adjudicated under its original jurisdiction. It was therefore his view that the application was properly before the Court.  In  response,  Mr.  Noah Tito, who  appeared  for  the  respondent  opposed  the  application  and,  among others  argued  that  since  the  applicant  seeks  leave  to  adduce  additional evidence in  respect of Civil  Appeal  No.  144 of 2018  she was supposed to predicate  her  application  under  Rule  36  (1)  (b)  of the  Rules  which  is  a specific  Rule  on  that  aspect. Mr.  Tito  added  that,  because  the  said application  was  lodged  after  the  filing  of  the  said  appeal  the  applicant ought  to  have  sought  the  guidance  of the  Court  on  that  matter  at  the hearing of the pending appeal.

The Court having heard both sides, at pages 1 1  to 13 of its Ruling stated that: -

"Having considered the position  of the iaw as to  when the additionai evidence may be adduced and the reiated pre-conditions our answer is in the negative.  Moreover, we are inclined to say so, because, One, in the wake of the pending Civil Appeal No.  144 of  2018 that would be

the proper forum for the applicant to address the Court on the question of  adducing additional evidence in terms of  Rules 36 (1) (b) of  the Rules. Two, to entertain and determine this application is tantamount to pre-empting and rendering superfluous the pending Civil  Appeal No. 144  of  2018 where  the  applicant  may  utilize the opportunity to pursue an application for leave to adduce additional evidence. Three, since what is sought by the applicant can be addressed at the hearing of  the pending appeal under the specific Rule 36 (1) (b) of the Rules, the present application predicated under Rule 4 (2) (a) of the  Rules  is  indeed  misconceived...In  view  of the aforesaid,  we are constrained to dismiss the application with costs."

Following  the  above  decision,  the  applicant  lodged  the present application  for  review  as  indicated  above.  In  the  notice  of  motion,  the applicant sought for the following orders, that: -

- (a) This Honourable Court be pleased to review and set aside the Ruling and its Order in  Civil Application  No.  177/20 of 2019 dated 24h  June,  2019 ("Application") and restore the Application to be heard on merit; and
- (b) The  costs  of and incidental  to  this  application  abide  the result of  this application.

On the following grounds: -

- (1) That, the decision of  the Honourabie Court has serious manifest errors on the face of  the record  resulting in miscarriage of justicef  as  the  Court dismissed the applicant's Application  as misconceived for being predicated under Rule 4 (2) (a) of the Rules and ruled that the applicant can invoke Rule 36 (1) (b) of  the Rules at the hearing of  the pending Civil  Appeal No, 144 of 2018 to apply to adduce additional evidencef  which  is an inapplicable Rule in the circumstances of  this case;
- (2) That, the applicant has been wrongly deprived of  an opportunity to be heard when the Honourabie Court ruled that the  applicant's  Application  for  leave to  adduce  additional evidence  which  was before it,  be made at the hearing of the pending Civii Appeal No.  144 of  2018 but strangely,  the Court dismissed  (not struck  out)  with  costs  the  application  which effectively means it will no longer be open to the applicant to go  back  to  the  same  Court and revive  the  matter  which  is already dismissed with costs;

- (3) That)   the decision of the Honourable Court is erroneous as the Court  ventured  on  its  own  and  delved  into  the  merits  of applicant's Application  when it considered the position of the law on when the additional evidence may be adduced and the related pre-conditions and ruled against the applicant without hearing  the  parties  and  thereby  occasioning  an  egregious failure of  the right to be heard;
- (4) That , the decision is wrong in law for  giving the applicant rights that are uncertain and  subjective,  which will lead to miscarriage  of justice,  since  in  effect  the  Honourable  Court having ruled that the applicant's Application  was improperly made  under Rule  4  (2)  (a)  of the  Rules and proceeded  to dismiss it,  the applicant cannot now make a similar application at the hearing of the pending Civil Appeal No.  144 of 2018, hence a failure of  right to be heard;
- (5) That,  the decision of the Honorable Court is  wrong in law in regarding  the  applicant's Application  under Rule  36(1  )(b)  of the Rules,  without considering the situation and circumstances of  the case; and

- (6) That, the decision of  the Honourabie Court has serious manifest errors on the face of  record resuiting in miscarriage of  justice in that the Court overiooked the applicant's case and misapplied the legal import behind the application of  Rule 4 (2) (a) of  the Rules by  narrowing it down.

At the  hearing  of the  application,  the applicant was  represented  by Mr.  John  Daniel  Kamugisha,  learned  counsel  while  the  respondent  was represented by Mr. Noah Tito, learned State Attorney assisted by Ms. Grace Makao, also learned State Attorney.

Mr.  Kamugisha commenced  his oral  submission  by first adopting  his written submissions he filed on 18t h  October, 2019. He then opted to jointly argue the grounds of his complaints in two categories. One, the 1s t ,  5 t h  and 6t h  and two, the 2n d ,  3r d  and 4t h  grounds.

Submitting  in support of the  1 s t ,   5 t h   and  6t h   grounds and  in trying to show an error apparent on the face of record in the impugned  Ruling,  Mr. Kamugisha  argued  that, the Court  after hearing  the parties on  the propriety  or  otherwise  of  the  application,  ought  to  have  struck  out  the application for being incompetent instead of dismissing it because it did not hear  the  same  on  its  merits. He  added  that,  the  Court  did not  only erroneously dismiss the application  but it also  imposed  a  condition to the

applicant  to  apply  to  adduce  additional  evidence  at  the  hearing  of  the pending Civil Appeal  No.  144 of 2018  in terms of Rules  36  (1)  (b)  of the Rules.  He said,  Rule 36 (1) (b) of the Rules is not applicable, because the decision of the  TRAT  which is subject  of  the pending  appeal was determined  by the TRAT while acting  on  its appellate jurisdiction  and  not original jurisdiction envisaged under that Rule.  He thus insisted that, in the circumstances, the only applicable provision is Rule 4 (2) (a) of the Rules.

As for the  2n d ,   3r d   and  4t h   grounds,  M r.  Kamugisha  argued  that the dismissal order was erroneously given  because the Court did  not hear the application on merits and it was thus impossible for the applicant to make a similar application before the Court or even at the hearing of the pending appeal,  hence  resulted  into a  serious  miscarriage of justice as the  parties were  denied  their  rights  to  be  heard  on  the  matter.  To  buttress  his position, he cited to us cases of Joseph Ntongwisangu and Another v. The  Principal  Secretary  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Another, Civil Reference  No.  10 of 2005  and Emmanuel  Luoga v.  Republic, Criminal Appeal  No.  281 of 2013 (both unreported). He then finally prayed for the application  to  be  granted  with  costs  and  urged  the  Court  to  modify  its impugned decision and restore the Civil Application No. 177/20 of 2019.

On his part, Mr. Tito strongly opposed the application by arguing that the  same  is  not  befitting  the  provision  of  Rule  66  (1)  (a)  of  the  Rules because none of the applicant's grounds exposes any manifest error on the face of record.  He contended that, the manner in which the application  is crafted  signifies the applicant's dissatisfaction with  the  impugned  decision which he said, in any case, does not qualify to be a ground for review.

Specifically, on the 1s t ,   5 t h  and 6t h  grounds,  M r. Tito argued that,  Rule 4  (2)  (a)  of the  Rules  relied  upon  by  the  applicant  can  only  be  invoked when there is no other provision in the Rules to address such matter and the Court invited to direct on the modality to be used in the circumstances. He clarified that in that application the applicant believed that there is no applicable  provision  to  address  her  matter  that  is  why  she  predicated  it under  Rule 4 (2)  (a)  but the Court after  hearing the  parties,  it found the application  misconceived  and directed the applicant to submit her request at the  hearing  of the  pending  appeal  under  Rule  36  (1)  (b).  It was  the strong argument by Mr. Tito that, since the issue of applicability of Rules 4 (2)  (a)  and  36  (1)  (b)  in  the  applicant's  application  had  already  been determined by the Court, when considering Civil Application  No.  177/20 of

2019,  it was improper for the applicants to reopen the same. As such,  he found all the authorities cited by Mr. Kamugisha in Joseph Ntongwisangu  and  Another (supra)  and Emmanuel  Luoga (supra) irrelevant and distinguishable from the current application.

As for the 2n d ,   3r d  and 4t h  grounds,  M r. Tito argued that it was proper for the  Court to  dismiss the  application  because  it was  submitted  at the wrong forum as the Court was not seized with the record of the appeal. On the  right to  be  heard,  Mr.  Tito  argued that  in   the  impugned  decision the applicant  was  directed  to  go  and  be  heard  at  the  pending  appeal  but instead of  complying  she  lodged  this  application. It was  the  strong argument of Mr. Tito that the applicant was supposed to implement the directive of the Court and not otherwise. Based on his submission he urged us to dismiss the application with costs for being misconceived.

Having carefully considered the submissions made by the counsel for the  parties  and  examined  the  record  before  us  and  in  particular  the impugned decision, the issue for our determination is whether the applicant has made out a case warranting a review on account of a manifest error on the face of record resulting in the miscarriage of justice.

There is no doubt that this Court in terms of section 4 (4) of the AJA has jurisdiction to  review its own  decision  in  any case which  is geared  at ensuring that a manifest injustice does not go uncorrected. See Chandrakant Joshubhai  Patel v.  Republic [2004] TLR 218.  However, Rule 66 (1) (a) to (e) of the Rules provides for the following circumstances under which such review can be done, that: -

- "66  (1) The Court may review its judgment or order,  but no application  for  review  shall  be  entertained  except  on  the following grounds:-
- (a)  the decision was based on a manifest error on the face of the record  resulting in the miscarriage of  justice; or
- (b)  a  party  was  wrongly  deprived  of an  opportunity  to  be heard;
- (c)  the court's decision is a nullity; or
- (d)  the court had  no  jurisdiction to entertain the case; or
- (e)  the  judgment  was  procured  illegally, or  by  fraud  or perjury."

Therefore, since in the application at hand the review sought against the impugned decision is on the ground of a manifest error on the face of the  record,  we  deem  it  prudent  to  restate  what  does  such  an  error constitute. In the case of Nguza Vikings @ Babu Seya and Another v. Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 5  of 2010 (unreported) we said: -

"There is no dispute as to  what constitutes a manifest error apparent on the face of record.  It has to be such an  error  that  is  obvious  and patent  mistake  and not something  which  can  be  established by  a  iong-drawn process of  reasoning on points which may be conceivably be two opinions...

Moreover, MULLA, Commentary on the Indian Code of Civil Procedure, 1998, 14t h  Edition at pp 2335 - 6 defines a manifest error as: -   " A n  error  on the face of  record  must be such as can be seen by one who writes and reads..."

From the above authorities  it  is  clear that the term  an 'error on  the face of record' signifies an error which is evident from the record of the

case and it does not require detailed examination, scrutiny and clarification either of facts or legal exposition. Thus, if an error is not self-evident and its detection requires a   long debate and process of reasoning, it cannot be treated as an error on the face of record.  [See Chandrakant Joshubhai Patel (supra)].

In  the  matter at  hand,  we  have examined  the  six grounds  raised  by the applicant in the notice of motion together with the supporting affidavit and the  submission  made  by  Mr.  Kamugisha,  we  are  however  unable to see anything akin to a manifest error on the face of record resulting in the miscarriage of justice as alleged by the applicant.  It is on  record that, the main argument of Mr. Kamugisha is that after finding that the application is incompetent  the  Court  should  have  struck  out the  application  instead  of dismissing  it.  With  respect,  we find  this  line of argument to  be  wanting, because, as correctly argued  by Mr. Tito,  in  its decision, the Court did  not find  the application  incompetent but misconceived  for being  submitted  at the wrong forum.  For the sake of clarity, we deem  it crucial to  reproduce the decision of the Court found at pages 12 - 13 of the impugned decision, where the Court stated that:-

".. . since what  is  sought  by  the applicant can be addressed at the hearing of  the pending appeai under the  specific Ruie  36  (1)  (b)  of the  Rules,  the present application predicated under Rule 4 (2) (a) of the Rules is indeed  misconceived...In this regard, as earlier  stated at  the  hearing  of Civil  Appeal  No. 144  of 2018  the applicant  can  invoke  Rule  36  (1)  (b)  of the  Rules  to apply to adduce the additional evidence.  We thus agree with Mr. Tito that this application is indeed misconceived. In view of the aforesaid, we are constrained to dismiss the application with costs."

From the above extract,  it is clear that the Court after observing that the application was submitted to the wrong forum, it dismissed it for being misconceived  and  directed  the  applicant  to  apply  to  adduce  additional evidence at the appropriate forum, that is, at the hearing of the respective appeal  where the  Court will  be  seized  with  the  record  of appeal.  In  that regard,  we are  in  agreement with  M r.  Tito that decisions of the  Court  in Joseph  Ntongwisangu  and  Another (supra)  and Emmanuel  Luoga (supra) relied upon  by Mr.  Kamugisha in  his submission are irrelevant and

inapplicable in this matter because in those cases the Court found matters before it incompetent while in the matter at hand, the Court found that the application misconceived for being submitted at the wrong forum.

We must emphasize that, the basis of our decision was not only that the applicant could not approach the Court on a separate application under Rule 4 (2) (a) but also that, the applicant has to access the Court when the pending appeal is called on for hearing and apply to adduce additional evidence  on  the  same  under  Rule  36  (1)  (b)  of  the  Rules.  It  is  in   this regard  that  the  Court  dismissed  the  applicant's  application for being misconceived instead of striking it out.

We have thus noted with concern that, the applicant herein, instead of complying with the Court's directive to apply to adduce additional evidence at the hearing of the pending appeal, she decided to lodge this application, which  we find,  not only flooding  the  Court with  unnecessary applications but also an abuse of the court process.

We even find the submission by Mr.  Kamugisha  under the 2n d ,   3r d  and 5t h   grounds  unfounded,  because  in  the  impugned  decision,  as argued  by Mr. Tito, the Court did  not deny the applicant's right to be  heard as both

counsel for the parties were given ample time and opportunity to address us  as  to why  Rule  36  (1) (b) was  not  applicable. Based  on  their submissions  and  for  purposes  of  facilitating smooth  administration  of justice,  we  categorically  directed  the  applicant  to  utilize  her  right  at the hearing  of the  pending  appeal,  because  it is for the  Court,  when  hearing the appeal,  to decide whether to allow the respective party who seeks to adduce  additional  evidence  to  either  submit  the  application  formally  or informally. As  such,  even  the  submission  of  Mr. Kamugisha  that  the pending appeal  does not emanate from the decision of the Tribunal in  its original  jurisdiction  is  misplaced.  (See Sheikh  Issa  Seif  Gulu  and  3 Others v.  Rajabu  Mangara and 10 Others, Civil  Application  No.  63 of 2007 (unreported) which is reproduced at page 9 of the impugned Ruling.

In  the  circumstances,  we  are  satisfied  that  the  applicant  has  not shown  such  obvious  and  apparent  error  on  the  face  of  record.  It  is therefore  our  respectful  view  that,  since  the  Court  dismissed  the  matter after finding the same misconceived and properly directed the applicant to be heard at the pending appeal in terms of section 36 (1) (b) of the Rules, which she has  not complied with, then  her dissatisfaction with the finding of the Court cannot be said to constitute an error apparent on the face of

record  so  as  to  justify  a review. In  this regard,  we  are  entirely  in agreement  with  Mr.  Tito  that  the  application  is  misconceived  and  is  an abuse of court process.

For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit in the application and it is hereby dismissed with costs.
