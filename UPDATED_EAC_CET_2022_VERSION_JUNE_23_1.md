## INTRODUCTION

This publication contains the following:

The	text	of	the	Nomenclature	established	under	the	International	Convention	on	the	Harmonized	Commodity	Description and Coding System, approved by the Customs Co-operation Council on June 1983, amended as at 1 st  January 2022.

The	Handbook	includes	the	General	Rules	for	the	Interpretation	of	the	Harmonized	System,	abbreviations	and	symbols, Section, Chapter and Subheading Notes, and the headings and subheadings.

Each	heading	is	identified	by	four	digits,	the	first	two	indicating	the	Chapter	number	and	the	second	two	the	numerical order in which the heading appears within the Chapter.

The	heading	numbers	are	shown	in	the	first	column.	The	second	column	contains	the	eight-digit	codes	of	the	Harmonized System as transposed at the EAC level. The third column contains the text of the headings in bold and the texts of subheadings.		The	fourth	column	contains	units	of	quantity	for	use	when	reporting	statistics	based	on	the	Harmonized System.	The	fifth	column	contains	applicable	Common	External	Tariff	rates.

The Handbook comprises Schedule 1 with duty rates under the three-band tax structure and Schedule 2 with  duty rates of sensitive items.

The	fifth	 column	 of	 Schedule	 1	 contains	 applicable	 Common	External	Tariff	rates	and	where	the	abbreviation	'SI' (Sensitive	Items)	appears	the	applicable	duty	rates	shall	be	those	specified	in	Schedule	2.

## GENERAL INTERPRETATION RULES FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS

Classification	of	goods	in	the	Nomenclature	shall	be	governed	by	the	following	principles	:

- 1. The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification	shall	be	determined	according	to	the	terms	of	the	headings	and	any	relative	Section	or	Chapter Notes and, provided such headings  or Notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions :
- 2. (a) Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished,	provided	that,	as	presented,	the	incomplete	or	unfinished	article	has	the	essential	character of	the	complete	or	finished	article.		It	shall	also	be	taken	to	include	a	reference	to	that	article	complete	or finished	(or	falling	to	be	classified	as	complete	or	finished	by	virtue	of	this	Rule),	presented	unassembled or disassembled.
- (b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or  combinations of that  material  or  substance  with  other  materials  or  substances.   Any  reference  to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or	partly	of	such	material	or	substance.		The	classification	of	goods	consisting	of	more	than	one	material or substance shall be according to the principles of Rule 3.
- 3. When	by	application	of	Rule	2	(b)	or	for	any	other	reason,	goods	are,	prima	facie,	classifiable	under	two	or	more headings,	classification	shall	be	effected	as	follows	:
- (a) The	heading	which	provides	the	most	specific	description	shall	be	preferred	to	headings	providing	a more general description.  However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale,	those	headings	are	to	be	regarded	as	equally	specific	in	relation	to	those	goods,	even	if	one	of	them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods.
- (b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods	put	up	in	sets	for	retail	sale,	which	cannot	be	classified	by	reference	to	3	(a),	shall	be	classified	as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.

COMMON EXTERNAL TARIFF | 2022 VERSION

- (c) When	goods	cannot	be	classified	by	reference	to	3	(a)	or	3	(b),	they	shall	be	classified	under	the	heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.
- 4. Goods	which	cannot	be	classified	in	accordance	with	the	above	Rules	shall	be	classified	under	the	heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.
- 5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following Rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein :
- (a) Camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing instrument cases, necklace cases and similar	containers,	specially	shaped	or	fitted	to	contain	a	specific	article	or	set	of	articles,	suitable	for longterm	use	and	presented	with	the	articles	for	which	they	are	intended,	shall	be	classified	with	such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. This Rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character;
- (b) Subject to the provisions of Rule 5 (a) above, packing materials and packing containers presented with the	goods	therein	shall	be	classified	with	the	goods	if	they	are	of	a	kind	normally	used	for	packing	such goods.  However, this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use.
- 6. For	legal	purposes,	the	classification	of	goods	in	the	subheadings	of	a	heading	shall	be	determined	according	to the terms of those subheadings and any related Subheading Notes and, mutatis mutandis , to the above Rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable.  For the purposes of this Rule the relative Section and Chapter Notes also apply, unless the context otherwise requires.

## Notes.

- 1.The expression 'milk' means full cream milk or partially or completely skimmed milk.
- 2.For	the	purposes	of	heading	04.03,	yogurt	may	be	concentrated	or	flavoured	and	may	contain	added	sugar	or other sweetening matter, fruit, nuts, cocoa, chocolate, spices, coffee or coffee extracts, plants, parts of plants, cereals or bakers' wares, provided that any added substance is not used for the purpose of replacing, in whole or in part, any milk constituent, and the product retains the essential character of yogurt.
- 3.For the purposes of heading 04.05:
- (a) The term 'butter' means natural butter, whey butter or recombined butter (fresh, salted or rancid, including canned butter) derived exclusively from milk, with a milkfat content of 80% or more but not more than 95% by weight, a maximum milk solids-not-fat content of 2% by weight and a maximum water content of	16%	by	weight.		Butter	does	not	contain	added	emulsifiers,	but	may	contain	sodium	chloride,	food colours, neutralising salts and cultures of harmless lactic-acid-producing bacteria.
- (b) The expression 'dairy spreads' means a spreadable emulsion of the water-in-oil type, containing milkfat as the only fat in the product, with a milkfat content of 39% or more but less than 80% by weight.
- 4.Products	obtained	by	the	concentration	of	whey	and	with	the	addition	of	milk	or	milkfat	are	to	be	classified	as cheese in heading 04.06 provided that they have the three following characteristics:
- (a) a milkfat content, by weight of the dry matter, of 5% or more;
- (b) a dry matter content, by weight, of at least 70% but not exceeding 85%; and
- (c) they are moulded or capable of being moulded.
- 5.This Chapter does not cover:
- (a) Non-living	insects,	unfit	for	human	consumption	(heading	05.11);
- (b) Products obtained from whey, containing by weight more than 95% lactose, expressed as anhydrous lactose calculated on the dry matter (heading 17.02);
- (c) Products obtained from milk by replacing one or more of its natural constituents (for example, butyric fats) by another substance (for example, oleic fats) (heading 19.01 or 21.06); or
- (d) Albumins (including concentrates of two or more whey proteins, containing by weight more than 80% whey proteins, calculated on the dry matter) (heading 35.02) or globulins (heading 35.04).
- 6.For the purposes of heading 04.10, the term 'insects' means edible non-living insects, whole or in parts, fresh, chilled,	frozen,	dried,	smoked,	salted	or	in	brine,	as	well	as	flours	and	meals	of	insects,	fit	for	human	consumption. However, it does not cover edible non-living insects otherwise prepared or preserved (generally Section IV).

## Subheading Notes.

- 1.For	the	purposes	of	subheading	0404.10,	the	expression	'modified	whey'	means	products	consisting	of	whey constituents, that is, whey from which all or part of the lactose, proteins or minerals have been removed, whey to which natural whey constituents have been added, and products obtained by mixing natural whey constituents.
- 2.For  the  purposes  of  subheading  0405.10  the  term  'butter'  does  not  include  dehydrated  butter  or  ghee (subheading 0405.90).

## Chapter 8

## Edible fruit and nuts; peel of citrus fruit or melons

## Notes.

- 1.This Chapter does not cover inedible nuts or fruits.
- 2.Chilled	fruits	and	nuts	are	to	be	classified	in	the	same	headings	as	the	corresponding	fresh	fruits	and	nuts.
- 3.Dried fruit or dried nuts of this Chapter may be partially rehydrated, or treated for the following purposes:
- (a) For additional preservation or stabilisation (for example, by moderate heat treatment, sulphuring, the addition of sorbic acid or potassium sorbate),
- (b) To improve or maintain their appearance (for example, by the addition of vegetable oil or small quantities of glucose syrup),

provided that they retain the character of dried fruit or dried nuts.

- 4.Heading 08.12 applies to fruit and nuts which have been treated solely to ensure their provisional preservation during transport or storage prior to use (for example, by sulphur dioxide gas, in brine, in sulphur water or in other preservative solutions), provided they remain unsuitable for immediate consumption in that state.

## Chapter 10

## Cereals

## Notes.

- 1.(A) The	products	specified	in	the	headings	of	this	Chapter	are	to	be	classified	in	those	headings only if grains are present, whether or not in the ear or on the stalk.
- (B) The Chapter does not cover grains which have been hulled or otherwise worked. However, rice, husked, milled,	polished,	glazed,	parboiled	or	broken	remains	classified	in	heading	10.06.	Similarly,	quinoa	from which the pericarp has been wholly or partly removed in order to separate the saponin, but which has not undergone	any	other	processes,	remains	classified	in	heading	10.08.
- 2.Heading 10.05 does not cover sweet corn (Chapter 7).

## Subheading Note.

- 1The term 'durum wheat' means wheat of the Triticum durum species and the hybrids derived from the interspecific	crossing	of Triticum durum which have the same number (28) of chromosomes as that species.

## Note.

- 1.In this Section the term 'pellets' means products which have been agglomerated either directly by compression or by the addition of a binder in a proportion not exceeding 3% by weight.

## Chapter 16

## Preparations of meat, of fish, crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, or of insects

## Notes.

- 1.This	Chapter	does	not	cover	meat,	meat	offal,	fish,	crustaceans,	molluscs	or	other	aquatic	invertebrates,	as well	as	insects,	prepared	or	preserved	by	the	processes	specified	in	Chapter	2	or	3,	Note	6	to	Chapter	4	or	in heading 05.04.
- 2.Food preparations fall in this Chapter provided that they contain more than 20 % by weight of sausage, meat, meat	offal,	 blood,	 insects,	 fish	 or	 crustaceans,	 molluscs	 or	 other	 aquatic	 invertebrates,	 or	 any	 combination thereof.		In	cases	where	the	preparation	contains	two	or	more	of	the	products	mentioned	above,	it	is	classified in the heading of Chapter 16 corresponding to the component or components which predominate by weight. These provisions do not apply to the stuffed products of heading 19.02 or to the preparations of heading 21.03 or 21.04.

## Subheading Notes.

- 1.For the purposes of subheading 1602.10, the expression 'homogenised preparations' means preparations of meat,	meat	offal,	blood	or	insects,	finely	homogenised,	put	up	for	retail	sale	as	food	suitable	for	infants	or	young children or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net weight content not exceeding 250 g.  For the application of	this	definition	no	account	is	to	be	taken	of	small	quantities	of	any	ingredients	which	may	have	been	added	to the preparation for seasoning, preservation or other purposes.  These preparations may contain a small quantity of visible pieces of meat, meat offal or insects. This subheading takes precedence over all other subheadings of heading 16.02.
- 2.The		fish,	crustaceans,	molluscs	and	other	aquatic	invertebrates		specified	in	the	subheadings	of	heading	16.04 or 16.05 under their common names only, are of the same species as those mentioned in Chapter 3 under the same name.

## Subheading Notes

- 1.For the purposes of subheadings 1701.12, 1701.13 and 1701.14,  'raw sugar' means sugar whose content of sucrose by weight, in the dry state, corresponds to a polarimeter reading of less than 99.5¬∞.
- 2.Subheading 1701.13 covers only cane sugar obtained without  centrifugation, whose content of sucrose by weight, in the dry state,  corresponds to a polarimeter reading of 69¬∞ or more but less than 93¬∞. The product contains only natural anhedral microcrystals, of irregular shape, no visible to the naked eye, which are surrounded by residues of molasses and other constituents of sugar cane.

- (c) Sludges from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, consisting mainly of such oils (heading 27.10);
- (d) Basic slag of Chapter 31;
- (e) Slag wool, rock wool or similar mineral wools (heading 68.06);
- (f) Waste or scrap of precious metal or of metal clad with precious metal; other waste or scrap containing precious metal or precious metal compounds, of a kind used principally for the recovery of precious metal heading 71.12 or 85.49);or
- (g) Copper, nickel or cobalt mattes produced by any process of smelting (Section XV).
- 2.For the purposes of headings. 26.01 to 26.17, the term 'ores' means minerals of mineralogical species actually used in the metallurgical industry for the extraction of mercury, of the metals of heading 28.44 or of the metals of Section XIV or XV, even if they are intended for non-metallurgical purposes.  Headings. 26.01 to 26.17 do not, however, include minerals which have been submitted to processes not normal to the metallurgical industry.

## 3.Heading 26.20 applies only to:

- (a) Slag, ash and residues of a kind used in industry either for the extraction of metals or as a basis for the manufacture of chemical compounds of metals, excluding ash and residues from the incineration of municipal waste (heading 26.21); and
- (b) Slag, ash and residues containing arsenic, whether or not containg metals, of  a kind used either for the extraction of arsenic or metals or for the manufacture of their chemical compounds.

## Subheading Notes.

- 1.For the purposes of subheading 2620.21, 'leaded gasoline sludges and leaded anti-knock compound sludges' mean sludges obtained from storage  tanks of leaded gasoline and leaded anti-knock compounds (for example, tetraethyl lead), and consisting essentially of lead, lead compounds and iron oxide.
- 2.Slag, ash and residues containing  arsenic, mercury, thallium or their mixtures, of a kind used for the extraction of arsenic	or	those		metals	or	for	the	manufacture	of	their	chemical	compounds,	are	to	be	classified	in	subheading 2620.60.

## Chapter 27

## Mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their distillation; bituminous substances; mineral waxes

## Notes.

- 1.This Chapter does not cover:
- (a) Separate	chemically	defined	organic	compounds,	other	than	pure	methane	and	propane,	which	are	to	be classified	in	heading	27.11;
- (b) Medicaments of heading 30.03 or 30.04; or
- (c) Mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 33.01, 33.02 or 38.05.
- 2.References in heading 27.10 to 'petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals' include not only petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals but also similar oils, as well as those consisting mainly  of  mixed  unsaturated  hydrocarbons,  obtained  by  any  process,  provided  that  the  weight  of  the  nonaromatic constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents.
- However,	the	references	do	not	include	liquid	synthetic	polyolefins	of	which	less	than	60%	by	volume	distils	at 300 ¬∞C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (Chapter 39).
- 3.For the purposes of heading 27.10, 'waste oils' means waste containing mainly petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (as described in Note 2 to this Chapter), whether or not mixed with water. These include:
- (a) Such	oils	no	longer	fit	for	use	as	primary	products	(for	example,	used	lubricating	oils,	used	hydraulic	oils and used transformer oils);
- (b) Sludge oils from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and a high concentration of additives (for example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of the primary products; and
- (c) Such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water, such as those resulting from oil spills, storage tank washings, or from the use of cutting oils for machining operations.

## Subheading Notes.

- 1.For the purposes of subheading 2701.11, 'anthracite' means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineralmatter-free basis) not exceeding 14%.
- 2.For the purposes of subheading 2701.12, 'bituminous coal' means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free	basis)	exceeding	14%	and	a	calorific	value	limit	(on	a	moist,	mineral-matter-free	basis)	equal to or greater than 5,833 kcal/kg.
- 3.For	the	purposes	of	subheadings	2707.10,	2707.20,	2707.30,	and	2707.40,	the	terms	'benzol	(benzene)',	'toluol (toluene)', 'xylol (xylenes)' and 'naphthalene' apply to products which contain more than 50% by weight of benzene,	toluene,	xylene	or	naphthalene,	respectively.
- 4.For the purposes of subheading 2710.12, 'light oils and preparations' are those of which 90 % or more by volume (including losses) distil at 210 ¬∞C according to the ISO 3405 method (equivalent to the ASTM D 86 method).
- 5.For the purposes of the subheadings of heading 27.10, the term 'biodiesel' means mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids of a kind used as a fuel, derived from animal, vegetable or microbial fats and oils whether or not used.

For the purposes of this Note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together.
- If  no  single  comonomer  unit  predominates,  copolymers  or  polymer  blends,  as  the  case  may  be,  are  to  be classified	in	the	heading	which	occurs	last	in	numerical	order	among	those	which	equally	merit	consideration.
- 5.Chemically	modified	polymers,	that	is	those	in	which	only	appendages	to	the	main	polymer	chain	have	been changed	by	chemical	reaction,	are	to	be	classified	in	the	heading	appropriate	to	the	unmodified	polymer.	This provision does not apply to graft copolymers.
- 6.In headings 39.01 to 39.14, the expression 'primary forms' applies only to the following forms:
- (a) Liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions;

## Subheading Notes.

- 1.Within	any	one	heading	of	this	Chapter,	polymers	(including	copolymers)	and	chemically	modified	polymers	are to	be	classified	according	to	the	following	provisions:
- (a) Where there is a subheading named 'Other' in the same series:
- (1) The	designation	in	a	subheading	of	a	polymer	by	the	prefix	'poly'	(for	example,	polyethylene	and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content.
- (2) The copolymers named in subheadings 3901.30, 3901.40, 3903.20,   3903.30 and 3904.30 are to be			classified	in	those	subheadings,	provided		that	the	comonomer	units	of	the	named	copolymers contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total polymer content.
- (3) Chemically	modified	polymers	are	to	be	classified	in	the	subheading	named	'Other',	provided	that the	chemically	modified	polymers	are	not	more	specifically	covered	by	another	subheading.
- (4) Polymers	not	meeting	(1),	(2)	or	(3)	above,	are	to	be	classified	in	the	subheading,	among	the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together.  Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared.
- (b) Where there is no subheading named 'Other' in the same series:
- (1) Polymers	are	to	be	classified	in	the	subheading	covering	polymers	of	that	monomer	unit	which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together.  Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared.
- (2) Chemically	modified	polymers	are	to	be	classified	in	the	subheading	appropriate	to	the	unmodified polymer.

Polymer	blends	are	to	be	classified	in	the	same	subheading	as	polymers	of	the	same	monomer	units	in the same proportions.

2.- For the purposes of subheading 3920.43, the term 'plasticisers' includes secondary plasticisers.

- 4.In Note 1 to this Chapter and in heading 40.02, the expression 'synthetic rubber' applies to:
- (a) Unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation with sulphur into  non-thermoplastic  substances  which,  at  a  temperature  between  18¬∞C  and  29¬∞C,  will  not  break on  being  extended  to  three  times  their  original  length  and  will  return,  after  being  extended  to  twice their	original	length,	within	a	period	of	five	minutes,	to	a	length	not	greater	than	one	and	a	half	times their original length.  For the purposes of this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanising activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances as provided for by Note 5 (B) (ii) and (iii) is also permitted.  However, the presence of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking,	such	as	extenders,	plasticisers	and	fillers,	is	not	permitted;
- (b) Thioplasts (TM); and
- (c) Natural	rubber	modified	by	grafting	or	mixing	with	plastics,	depolymerised	natural	rubber,	mixtures	of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided that all the abovementioned products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanisation, elongation and recovery in (a) above.
- 5.(A) Headings 40.01 and 40.02 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after coagulation, with:
- (i) vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanised rubber latex);
- (ii) pigments  or  other  colouring  matter,  other  than  those  added  solely  for  the  purpose  of identification;
- (iii) plasticisers	or	extenders	(except	mineral	oil	in	the	case	of	oil-extended	rubber),	fillers, reinforcing  agents,  organic  solvents  or  any  other  substances,  except  those  permitted under (B);

COMMON EXTERNAL TARIFF | 2022 VERSION

- (B) The  presence  of  the  following  substances  in  any  rubber  or  mixture  of  rubbers  shall  not  affect  its classification	in	heading	40.01	or	40.02,	as	the	case	may	be,	provided	that	such	rubber	or	mixture	of rubbers retains its essential character as a raw material:
- (i) emulsifiers	or	anti-tack	agents;
- (ii) small	amounts	of	breakdown	products	of	emulsifiers;
- (iii) very small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents (generally for obtaining thermosensitive rubber  latexes),  cationic  surface-active  agents  (generally  for  obtaining  electro-positive  rubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptisers, preservatives, stabilisers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-purpose additives.
- 6.For the purposes of heading 40.04, the expression 'waste, parings and scrap' means rubber waste, parings and	scrap	from	the	manufacture	or	working	of	rubber	and	rubber	goods	definitely	not	usable	as	such	because of cutting-up, wear or other reasons.
- 7.Thread	wholly	of	vulcanised	rubber,	of	which	any	cross-sectional	dimension	exceeds	5	mm,	is	to	be	classified as	strip,	rods	or	profile	shapes,	of	heading	40.08.
- 8.Heading 40.10 includes conveyor or transmission belts or belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or  laminated  with  rubber  or  made  from  textile  yarn  or  cord  impregnated,  coated,  covered  or  sheathed  with rubber.
- 9.In headings 40.01, 40.02, 40.03, 40.05 and 40.08, the expressions 'plates', 'sheets' and 'strip' apply only to plates, sheets and strip and to blocks of regular geometric shape, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or not having the character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise surfaceworked, but not otherwise cut to shape or further worked.

In	heading	40.08	the	expressions	'rods'	and	'profile	shapes'	apply	only	to	such	products,	whether	or	not	cut	to length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked.

## Chapter 54

## Man-made filaments; strip and the like of man-made textile materials

## Notes.

- 1.Throughout	 the	 Nomenclature,	 the	 term	 'man-made	 fibres'	 means	 staple	 fibres	 and	 filaments	 of	 organic polymers produced by manufacturing processes, either:
- (a) By	polymerisation	of	organic	monomers	to	produce	polymers	such	as	polyamides,	polyesters,	polyolefins or	 polyurethanes,	 or	 by	 chemical	 modification	 of	 polymers	 produced	 by	 this	 process	 (for	 example, poly(vinyl alcohol) prepared by the hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate)); or
- (b) By dissolution or chemical treatment of natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose) to produce polymers	such	as	cuprammonium	rayon	(cupro)	or	viscose	rayon,	or	by	chemical	modification	of	natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose, casein and other proteins, or alginic acid), to produce  polymers such as cellulose acetate or alginates.

The	terms	'synthetic'	and	'artificial',	used	in	relation	to	fibres,	mean:	synthetic:	fibres	as	defined	at	(a); artificial:	fibres	as	defined	at	(b).	Strip	and	the	like	of	heading	54.04	or	54.05	are	not	considered	to	be man-made	fibres.

The	terms	'man-made',	'synthetic'	and	'artificial'	shall	have	the	same	meanings	when	used	in	relation to 'textile materials'.

- 2.Headings	54.02	and	54.03	do	not	apply	to	synthetic	or	artificial	filament	tow	of	Chapter	55.

- 2.The	term	'felt'	includes	needleloom	felt	and	fabrics	consisting	of	a	web	of	textile	fibres	the	cohesion	of	which	has been	enhanced	by	a	stitch-bonding	process	using	fibres	from	the	web	itself.
- 3.Headings 56.02 and 56.03 cover respectively felt and nonwovens, impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics or rubber whatever the nature of these materials (compact or cellular).
- Heading 56.03 also includes nonwovens in which plastics or rubber forms the bonding substance.
- Headings 56.02 and 56.03 do not, however, cover:
- (a) Felt impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics or rubber, containing 50 % or less by weight of textile material or felt completely embedded in plastics or rubber (Chapter 39 or 40);
- (b) Nonwovens, either completely embedded in plastics or rubber, or entirely coated or covered on both sides with such materials, provided that such coating or covering can be seen with the naked eye with no account being taken of any resulting change of colour (Chapter 39 or 40); or
- (c) Plates, sheets or strip of cellular plastics or cellular rubber combined with felt or nonwovens, where the textile material is present merely for reinforcing purposes (Chapter 39 or 40).
- 4.Heading 56.04 does not cover textile yarn, or strip or the like of heading 54.04 or 54.05, in which the impregnation, coating or covering cannot be seen with the naked eye (usually Chapters 50 to 55); for the purpose of this provision, no account should be taken of any resulting change of colour.

## Chapter 59

## Impregnated, coated, covered or laminated textile fabrics; textile articles of a kind suitable for industrial use

## Notes.

- 1.Except where the context otherwise requires, for the purposes of this Chapter the expression 'textile fabrics' applies only to the woven fabrics of Chapters 50 to 55 and headings 58.03 and 58.06, the braids and ornamental trimmings in the piece of heading 58.08 and the knitted or crocheted fabrics of heading 60.02 to 60.06.
- 2.Heading 59.03 applies to:
- (a) Textile fabrics, impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics, whatever the weight per square metre and whatever the nature of the plastic material (compact or cellular), other than:
- (1) Fabrics in which the impregnation, coating or covering cannot be seen with the naked eye (usually Chapters 50 to 55, 58 or 60); for the purpose of this provision, no account should be taken of any resulting change of colour;
- (2) Products which cannot, without fracturing, be bent manually around a cylinder of a diameter of 7 mm, at a temperature between 15 ¬∞C and 30 ¬∞C (usually Chapter 39);
- (3) Products in which the textile fabric is either completely embedded in plastics or entirely coated or covered on both sides with such material, provided that such coating or covering can be seen with the naked eye with no account being taken of any resulting change of colour (Chapter 39);
- (4) Fabrics partially coated or partially covered with plastics and bearing designs resulting from these treatments (usually Chapters 50 to 55, 58 or 60);
- (5) Plates, sheets or strip of cellular plastics, combined with textile fabric, where the textile fabric is present merely for reinforcing purposes (Chapter 39); or
- (6) Textile products of heading 58.11;
- (b) Fabrics made from yarn, strip or the like, impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with plastics, of heading 56.04.
- 3.For the purposes of heading 59.03, 'textile fabrics laminated with plastics' means products made by the assembly of	one	or	more	layers	of	fabrics	with	one	or	more	sheets	or	film	of	plastics	which	are	combined	by	any	process that	bonds	the	layers	together,	whether	or	not	the	sheets	or	film	of	plastics	are	visible	to	the	naked	eye	in	the cross-section.
- 4.For the purposes of heading 59.05, the expression 'textile wall coverings' applies to products in rolls, of a width of	not	less	than	45	cm,	suitable	for	wall	or	ceiling	decoration,	consisting	of	a	textile	surface	which	has	been	fixed on a backing or has been treated on the back (impregnated or coated to permit pasting).
- This	heading	does	not,	however,	apply	to	wall	coverings	consisting	of	textile	flock	or	dust	fixed	directly	on	a backing of paper (heading 48.14) or on a textile backing (generally heading 59.07).
- 5.For the purposes of heading 59.06, the expression 'rubberised textile fabrics' means:
- (a) Textile fabrics impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with rubber,

- (ii) Weighing more than 1,500 g/m2 and containing more than 50% by weight of textile material;
- (b) Fabrics  made  from  yarn,  strip  or  the  like,  impregnated,  coated,  covered  or  sheathed  with  rubber,  of heading 56.04; and
- (c) Fabrics  composed  of  parallel  textile  yarns  agglomerated  with  rubber,  irrespective  of  their  weight  per square metre.

This heading does not, however, apply to plates, sheets or strip of cellular rubber, combined with textile fabric, where the textile fabric is present merely for reinforcing purposes (Chapter 40), or textile products of heading 58.11.

- 6.Heading 59.07 does not apply to:

## Chapter 61

## Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted

## Notes.

- 1.This Chapter applies only to made up knitted or crocheted articles.
- 2.This Chapter does not cover:
- (a) Goods of heading 62.12;
- (b) Worn clothing or other worn articles of heading 63.09; or
- (c) Orthopaedic appliances, surgical belts, trusses or the like (heading 90.21).
- 3.For the purposes of headings 61.03 and 61.04:
- (a) The term 'suit' means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical fabric and comprising:
- -one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made from the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set and whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or jacket; and
- -one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.

All of the components of a 'suit' must be of the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must	also	be	of	the	same	style	and	of	corresponding	or	compatible	size.	However,	these	components may have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.

If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of trousers or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.

The	term	'suit'	includes	the	following	sets	of	garments,	whether	or	not	they	fulfil	all	the	above	conditions:

- -morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped trousers;
- -evening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;
- -dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt front) but has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels.
- (b) The term 'ensemble' means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading 61.07, 61.08 or 61.09), composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:
- -one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of pullovers which may form a second upper garment in the sole context of twin sets, and of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and
- -one or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.

All  of  the  components  of  an  ensemble  must  be  of  the  same  fabric  construction,  style,  colour  and composition;	they	also	must	be	of	corresponding	or	compatible	size.		The	term	'ensemble'	does	not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading 61.12.

- 4.Headings 61.05 and 61.06 do not cover garments with pockets below the waist, with a ribbed waistband or other means of tightening at the bottom of the garment, or garments having an average of less than 10 stitches per linear centimetre in each direction counted on an area measuring at least 10 cm x 10 cm.   Heading 61.05 does not cover sleeveless garments.
- 'Shirts' and 'shirt-blouses' are garments designed to cover the upper part of the body, having long or short sleeves	and	a	full	or	partial	opening	starting	at	the	neckline.		'Blouses'	are	loose-fitting	garments	also	designed to  cover  the  upper  part  of  the  body  but  may  be  sleeveless  and  with  or  without  an  opening  at  the  neckline. 'Shirts', 'shirt-blouses' and 'blouses' may also have a collar.
- 5.Heading 61.09 does not cover garments with a drawstring, ribbed waistband or other means of tightening at the bottom of the garment.
- 6.For the purposes of heading 61.11:
- (a) The expression 'babies' garments and clothing accessories' means articles for young children of a body height not exceeding 86 cm;
- (b) Articles	which	are,	prima	facie,	classifiable	both	in	heading	61.11	and	in	other	headings	of	this	Chapter are	to	be	classified	in	heading	61.11.
- 7.For the purposes of heading 61.12, 'ski suits' means garments or sets of garments which, by their general appearance	and	texture,	are	identifiable	as	intended	to	be	worn	principally	for	skiing	(cross-country	or	alpine). They consist either of:
- (a) a 'ski overall', that is, a one-piece garment designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to sleeves and a collar the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or
- (b) a 'ski ensemble', that is, a set of garments composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:
- -one  garment  such  as  an  anorak,  wind-cheater,  wind-jacket  or  similar  article,  closed  by  a  slide fastener	(zipper),	possibly	with	a	waistcoat	in	addition,	and
- -one pair of trousers whether or not extending above waist-level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.

The 'ski ensemble' may also consist of an overall similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of padded, sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.

All  the  components of a 'ski ensemble' must be made up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition	whether	or	not	of	the	same	colour;	they	also	must	be	of	corresponding	or	compatible	size.

- 8.Garments	which	are,	prima	facie,	classifiable	both	in	heading	61.13	and	in	other	headings	of	this	Chapter, excluding	heading	61.11,	are	to	be	classified	in	heading	61.13.
- 9.Garments of this Chapter designed for left over right closure at the front shall be regarded as men's or boys' garments, and those designed for right over left closure at the front as women's or girls' garments.  These provisions do not apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one or other of the sexes.

Garments	which	cannot	be	identified	as	either	men's	or	boys'	garments	or	as	women's	or	girls'	garments	are	to be	classified	in	the	headings	covering	women's	or	girls'	garments.

- 10.Articles of this Chapter may be made of metal thread.

## Chapter 62

## Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, not knitted or crocheted

## Notes.

- 1.This Chapter applies only to made up articles of any textile fabric other than wadding, excluding knitted or crocheted articles (other than those of heading 62.12).
- 2.This Chapter does not cover:
- (a) Worn clothing or other worn articles of heading 63.09; or
- (b) Orthopaedic appliances, surgical belts, trusses or the like (heading 90.21).
- 3.For the purposes of headings  62.03 and 62.04:
- (a) The term 'suit' means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical fabric and comprising:
- -one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made from the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set and whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or jacket; and
- -one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.

All of the components of a 'suit' must be of the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must	also	be	of	the	same	style	and	of	corresponding	or	compatible	size.		However,	these	components may have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.

If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of trousers or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.

The	term	'suit'	includes	the	following	sets	of	garments,	whether	or	not	they	fulfil	all	the	above	conditions:

- -morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped trousers;
- -evening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;
- -dinner  jacket  suits,  in  which  the  jacket  is  similar  in  style  to  an  ordinary  jacket  (though  perhaps revealing more of the shirt front), but has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels.
- (b) The term 'ensemble' means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading 62.07 or 62.08) composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:
- -one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and
- -one  or  two  different  garments,  designed  to  cover  the  lower  part  of  the  body  and  consisting  of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.

All  of  the  components  of  an  ensemble  must  be  of  the  same  fabric  construction,  style,  colour  and composition;	they	also	must		be	of	corresponding	or	compatible	size.		The	term	'ensemble'	does	not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading 62.11.

- (a) a 'ski overall', that is, a one-piece garment designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to sleeves and a collar the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or
- (b) a 'ski ensemble', that is, a set of garments composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:
- -one  garment  such  as  an  anorak,  wind-cheater,  wind-jacket  or  similar  article,  closed  by  a  slide fastener	(zipper),	possibly	with	a	waistcoat	in	addition,	and
- -one pair of trousers whether or not extending above waist-level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.

These provisions do not apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one or other of the sexes.
- Garments	which	cannot	be	identified	as	either	men's	or	boys'	garments	or	as	women's	or	girls'	garments	are	to be	classified	in	the	headings	covering	women's	or	girls'	garments.

10.- Articles of this Chapter may be made of metal thread.

2.- For the purposes of headings 70.03, 70.04 and 70.05:

(a) glass is not regarded as 'worked' by reason of any process it has undergone before annealing;

(b) cutting	to	shape	does	not	affect	the	classification	of	glass	in	sheets;

(c) the	 expression	 'absorbent,	 reflecting	 or	 non-reflecting	 layer'	 means	 a	 microscopically	 thin	 coating	 of metal or of a chemical compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example, infra-red light or	improves	the	reflecting	qualities	of	the	glass	while	still	allowing	it	to	retain	a	degree	of	transparency	or translucency;	or	which	prevents	light	from	being	reflected	on	the	surface	of	the	glass.

3.- The	 products	 referred	 to	 in	 heading	 70.06	 remain	 classified	 in	 that	 heading	 whether	 or	 not	 they	 have	 the character of articles.

4.- For the purposes of heading 70.19, the expression 'glass wool' means:

(a) Mineral wools with a silica (SiO ) content not less than 60% by weight; 2

COMMON EXTERNAL TARIFF | 2022 VERSION

- (a) An	alloy	of	base	metals	is	to	be	classified	as	an	alloy	of	the	metal	which	predominates	by	weight	over each of the other metals;
- (b) An alloy composed of base metals of this Section and of elements not falling within this Section is to be treated as an alloy of base metals of this Section if the total weight of such metals equals or exceeds the total weight of the other elements present;
- (c) In this Section the term 'alloys' includes sintered mixtures of metal powders, heterogeneous intimate mixtures obtained by melting (other than cermets) and intermetallic compounds.
- 6.Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference in the Nomenclature to a base metal includes a reference to	alloys	which,	by	virtue	of	Note	5	above,	are	to	be	classified	as	alloys	of	that	metal.

## 7.Classification	of	composite	articles:

Except where the headings otherwise require, articles of base metal (including articles of mixed materials treated as articles of base metal under the General Interpretative Rules) containing two or more base metals are to be treated as articles of the base metal predominating by weight over each of the other metals.

## For this purpose:

- (a) Iron and steel, or different kinds of iron or steel, are regarded as one and the same metal;
- (b) An alloy is regarded as being entirely composed of that metal as an alloy of which, by virtue of Note 5, it is	classified;	and
- (c) A cermet of heading 81.13 is regarded as a single base metal.
- 8.In this Section, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

## (a) Waste and scrap

- i) ( All metal waste and scrap;
- ii) ( Metal	goods	definitely	not	usable	as	such	because	of	breakage,	cutting-	up,	wear	or	other	reasons.

## (b) Powders

Products of which 90% or more by weight passes through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1 mm.

- 9.For the purposes of Chapters 74 to 76 and 78 to 81, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

## (a) Bars and rods

Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons	(including	'flattened	circles'	and	'modified	rectangles',	of	which	two	opposite	sides	are	convex	arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length.  The thickness of such	products	which	have	a	rectangular	(including	'modified	rectangular')	cross-section	exceeds	one-tenth	of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.

Wire-bars and billets of Chapter 74 with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire-rod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading 74.03.  This provision applies mutatis mutandis to the products of Chapter 81.

## (b) Profiles

Rolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross-section along their whole length,	which	do	not	conform	to	any	of	the	definitions	of	bars,	rods,	wire,	plates,	sheets,	strip,	foil,	tubes	or	pipes. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.

## (c) Wire

Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including	'flattened	circles'	and	'modified	rectangles',	of	which	two	opposite	sides	are	convex	arcs,	the	other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length.  The thickness of such products which	have	a	rectangular	(including	'modified	rectangular')	cross-section	exceeds	one-tenth	of	the	width

## (d) Plates, sheets, strip and foil

Flat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section	with	or	without	rounded	corners	(including	'modified	rectangles'	of	which	two	opposite	sides	are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are :

- -of rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width;
- -of	a	shape	other	than	rectangular	or	square,	of	any	size,	provided	that	they	do	not	assume	the	character of articles or products of other headings.

Headings for plates, sheets, strip, and foil apply, inter alia, to plates, sheets, strip, and foil with patterns (for example,	grooves,	ribs,	chequers,	tears,	buttons,	lozenges)	and	to	such	products	which	have	been	perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings.

## (e) Tubes and pipes

Hollow products coiled or not, which have a uniform cross-section with only one enclosed void along their whole length  in  the  shape  of  circles,  ovals,  rectangles  (including  squares),  equilateral  triangles  or  regular  convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall thickness.  Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal cross-section, which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be considered as tubes and pipes provided the inner and outer cross-sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation.  Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross-sections may be polished, coated, bent,	threaded,	drilled,	waisted,	expanded,	cone-shaped	or	fitted	with	flanges,	collars	or	rings.

Alloy steels containing by weight at least 0.6% but not more than 6% of silicon and not more than 0.08% of carbon.  They may also contain by weight not more than 1% of aluminium but no other element in a proportion that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel.

## (d) High speed steel

Alloy steels containing, with or without other elements, at least two of the three elements molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium with a combined content by weight of 7% or more, 0.6% or more of carbon and 3 to 6% of chromium.

## (e) Silico-manganese steel

Alloy steels containing by weight:

- not more than 0.7% of carbon,

- 0.5 % or more but not more than 1.9% of manganese, and

- 0.6% or more but not more than 2.3% of silicon, but no other element in a proportion that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel.

2.- For	the	classification	of	ferro-alloys	in	the	subheadings	of	heading	72.02	the	following	rule	should	be	observed	:

A	ferro-alloy	is	considered	as	binary	and	classified	under	the	relevant	subheading	(if	it	exists)	if	only	one	of	the alloy elements exceeds the minimum percentage laid down in Chapter Note 1 (c); by analogy, it is considered respectively as ternary or quaternary if two or three alloy elements exceed the minimum percentage.

For	the	application	of	this	rule	the	unspecified	'other	elements'	referred	to	in	Chapter	Note	1	(c)	must	each exceed 10% by weight.

## (b) Copper alloys

Metallic	substances	other	than	unrefined	copper	in	which	copper	predominates	by	weight	over	each	of the other elements, provided that:

- (i) the	content	by	weight	of	at	least	one	of	the	other	elements	is	greater	than	the	limit	specified	in the foregoing table; or
- (i) the total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 2.5%.

## (c) Master alloys

Alloys containing with other elements more than 10% by weight of copper, not usefully malleable and commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as de-oxidants, de-sulphurising agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy of non- ferrous metals. However, copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15% by weight of phosphorus falls in heading 28.53.

## Subheading Note.

- 1.In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:
- (a) Copper-zinc base alloys (brasses)

Alloys	of	copper	and	zinc,	with	or	without	other	elements.		When	other	elements	are	present:

- -zinc	predominates	by	weight	over	each	of	such	other	elements;
- -any	nickel	content	by	weight	is	less	than	5%	(see	copper-nickel-zinc	alloys	(nickel	silvers));	and
- -any	tin	content	by	weight	is	less	than	3%	(see	copper-tin	alloys	(bronzes)).

## (b) Copper-tin base alloys (bronzes)

Alloys of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present, tin predominates by	weight	over	each	of	such	other	elements,	except	that	when	the	tin	content	is	3%	or	more	the	zinc content by weight may exceed that of tin but must be less than 10%.

## (c) Copper-nickel-zinc base alloys (nickel silvers)

Alloys	of	copper,	nickel	and	zinc,	with	or	without	other	elements.		The	nickel	content	is	5%	or	more	by weight	(see	copper-zinc	alloys	(brasses)).

## (d) Copper-nickel base alloys

Alloys of copper and nickel, with or without other elements but in any case, containing by weight not more than	1%	of	zinc.		When	other	elements	are	present,	nickel	predominates	by	weight	over	each	of	such other elements

## (a) Nickel, not alloyed

Metal containing by weight at least 99% of nickel plus cobalt, provided that:

- (i) the cobalt content by weight does not exceed 1.5%, and
- (ii) the	content	by	weight	of	any	other	element	does	not	exceed	the	limit	specified	in	the	following table:

TABLE - Other elements

| Element              |   Limiting content %by weight |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fe Iron              |                           0.5 |
| O Oxygen             |                           0.4 |
| Other elements, each |                           0.3 |

## (b) Nickel alloys

Metallic substances in which nickel predominates by weight over each of the other elements provided that:

- (i) the content by weight of cobalt exceeds 1.5%,
- (ii) the	content	by	weight	of	at	least	one	of	the	other	elements	is	greater	than	the	limit	specified	in the foregoing table, or
- (iii) the total content by weight of elements other than nickel plus cobalt exceeds 1 %.
- 2.Notwithstanding the provisions of Note 9(c) to Section XV for the purposes of subheading 7508.10 the term 'wire' applies only to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 6 mm.

## Aluminium and articles thereof

## Subheading Notes.

- 1.In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

## (a) Aluminium, not alloyed

Metal containing by weight at least 99 % of aluminium, provided that the content by weight of any other element	does	not	exceed	the	limit	specified	in	the	following	table:

TABLE - Other elements

| Element                     | Limiting content %by weight   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fe + Si (iron plus silicon) | 1                             |
| Other elements (1) , each   | 0.1 (2)                       |

- (1) Other elements are, for example Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn.
- (2) Copper is permitted in a proportion greater than 0.1% but not more than 0.2%, provided that neither the chromium nor manganese content exceeds 0.05%.

## (b) Aluminium alloys

Metallic substances in which aluminium predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:

- (i) the content by weight of at least one of the other elements or of iron plus silicon taken together is	greater	than	the	limit	specified	in	the	foregoing	table;	or
- (ii) the total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 1%.
- 2.Notwithstanding the provisions of Note 9 (c) to Section XV, for the purposes of subheading 7616.91 the term 'wire' applies only to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 6 mm.

## Additional Notes

- 1.(A) Tools for the assembly or maintenance of machines

To	be	classified	with	the	appropriate	machines,	assembly	or	maintenance	tools	must	satisfy	the	following three conditions concerning their nature, intended use and presentation:

- (a) they must be tools, i.e., hand tools of heading No 4417 00 or 8205 or, for example, tools falling within subheading 8203 20, 8203 30, 8203 40, 8204 11, 8204 12, 9603 29, 9603 30, 9603 40, 9603 90.
- Measuring and checking instruments of chapter 90 are excluded in all cases;
- (b) they must be intended for the assembly or maintenance of the appropriate machine. Where the tools	are	identical,	only	those	which	must	be	used	simultaneously	are	to	be	classified	with	their machines. Where they are different, only one of each kind of tool is allowed;
- (c) they must be presented for customs clearance at the same time as the appropriate machines.
- (B) Interchangeable tools

To	be	classified	with	the	appropriate	machines,	interchangeable	tools	must	fulfil	three	conditions:

- (a) they must be tools, i.e., tools falling within heading No 8207 or, for example, tools falling within heading Nos 4016, 4204, 5911 and 6909 or within subheading 6804 10, 6804 21, 6804 22, 6804 23 or 9603 50.
- Moulds (heading No 8480) and accessories, including accessory apparatus (of, for example, heading  No  8466)  are  not  considered  as  tools  and  consequently  do  not  qualify  under  this Additional Note;
- (b) they must form part of the normal equipment of the appropriate machines.

The following are considered part of the normal equipment of a machine:

- (i) any number of identical tools which can be accommodated on the machine simultaneously;
- (ii) one of each kind of tool if the tools are different;
- (c) they must normally be sold with the appropriate machine and be presented for customs clearance with it.
- 2.A machine in a disassembled or unassembled state may be imported in several consignments over a period of time if this is necessary for convenience of trade or transport.

In order to be able to declare the different constituent parts under the same tariff heading or subheading as the assembled	machine,	the	declarant	must	make	a	request	in	writing	to	the	customs	post	not	later	than	the	first consignment and attach:

- (a) a manual, diagram or, if necessary several diagrams, of the machine showing the serial numbers of the most important constituent parts;
- (b) a general inventory containing an indication of the characteristics and approximate weights of the different parts and the serial numbers of the principal parts referred to above.

The	application	may	only	be	accepted	in	fulfilment	of	a	contract	for	the	supply	of	a	machine	which	can	be regarded as complete for the purposes of the EAC tariff Nomenclature.

All the constituent parts must be imported through the same entry point within the allowed time. However, in	special	cases,	the	competent	authorities	may	authorize	importation	through	several	points	of	entry. This	time	limit	may	not	be	exceeded	unless	a	reasoned	and	justified	request	for	an	extension	is	made	to the competent authorities.

Upon each partial importation, a list of the parts making up the consignment with references to the above mentioned general inventory must be provided. The customs declaration for each consignment must contain descriptions of both the part or parts making up the consignment and the complete machine.

## Chapter 88

## Aircraft, spacecraft, and parts thereof

## Note.

- 1.For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression 'unmanned aircraft' means any aircraft, other than those of heading	88.01,	designed	to	be	flown	without	a	pilot	on	board.		They	may	be	designed	to	carry	a	payload	or equipped with permanently integrated digital cameras or other equipment which would enable them to perform utilitarian	functions	during	their	flight.

The	 expression	 'unmanned	 aircraft',	 however,	 does	 not	 cover	 flying	 toys,	 designed	 solely	 for	 amusement purposes (heading 95.03).

## Subheading Notes.

- 1. For the purposes of subheadings 8802.11 to 8802.40, the expression 'unladen weight' means the weight of the	 machine	in	normal	flying	order,	excluding	the	weight	of	the	crew	and	of	fuel	and	equipment	other	than permanently	fitted	items	of	equipment.
- 2. For the purposes of subheadings 8806.21 to 8806.24 and 8806.91 to 8806.94, the expression 'maximum takeoff	weight'	means	the	maximum	weight	of	the	machine	in	normal	flying	order,	at	take-off,	including	the	weight	of payload, equipment and fuel.

## Chapter 91

## Clocks and watches and parts thereof

## Notes.

- 1.This Chapter does not cover:
- (a) Clock	or	watch	glasses	or	weights	(classified	according	to	their	constituent	material);
- (b) Watch chains (heading 71.13 or 71.17, as the case may be);
- (c) Parts	of	general	use	defined	in	Note	2	to	Section	XV,	of	base	metal	(Section	XV),	or	similar	goods	of plastics (Chapter 39) or of precious metal or metal clad with precious metal (generally heading 71.15); clock	or	watch	springs	are,	however,	to	be	classified	as	clock	or	watch	parts	(heading	91.14);
- (d) Bearing balls (heading 73.26 or 84.82, as the case may be);
- (e) Articles of heading 84.12 constructed to work without an escapement;
- (f) Ball bearings (heading 84.82); or
- (g) Articles  of  Chapter  85  not  yet  assembled  together  or  with  other  components  into  watch  or  clock movements or into articles suitable for use solely or principally as parts of such movements (Chapter 85).
- 2.Heading 91.01 covers only watches with case wholly of precious metal or of metal clad with precious metal, or of the same materials combined with natural or cultured pearls, or precious or semi-precious stones (natural, synthetic or reconstructed) of headings 71.01 to 71.04. Watches with case of base metal inlaid with precious metal fall in heading 91.02.
- 3.For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression 'watch movements' means devices regulated by a balancewheel	and	hairspring,	quartz	crystal	or	any	other	system	capable	of	determining	intervals	of	time,	with	a	display or a system to which a mechanical display can be incorporated. Such watch movements shall not exceed 12 mm in thickness and 50 mm in width, length or diameter.
- 4.Except as provided in Note 1, movements and other parts suitable for use both in clocks or watches and in other articles	(for	example,	precision	instruments)	are	to	be	classified	in	this	Chapter.

COMMON EXTERNAL TARIFF | 2022 VERSION

- 4.For	the	purposes	of	heading	94.06,	the	expression	'prefabricated	buildings'	means	buildings	which	are	finished in the factory or put up as elements, presented together, to be assembled on site, such as housing or worksite accommodation,	offices,	schools,	shops,	sheds,	garages	or	similar	buildings.

Prefabricated	buildings	include	'modular	building	units'	of	steel,	normally	presented	in	the	size	and	shape	of	a standard	shipping	container,	but	substantially	or	completely	pre-fitted	internally.		Such	modular	building	units	are normally designed to be assembled together to form permanent buildings.

## Additional note

- 1.A prefabricated buildings may be imported in several consignments over a period of time if this is necessary for convenience of trade or transport.
- In order to be able to declare the different constituent parts under the same tariff heading or subheading as the assembled prefabricated building, the declarant must make a request in writing to the customs post not later than the	first	consignment	and	attach:
- (a) a  manual,  diagram  or,  if  necessary  several  diagrams,  of  the  prefabricated  building  showing  the  serial numbers of the most important constituent parts;
- (b) a general inventory containing an indication of the characteristics and approximate weights of the different parts and the serial numbers of the principal parts referred to above.

The	application	may	only	be	accepted	in	fulfilment	of	a	contract	for	the	supply	of	prefabricated	building	which	can be regarded as complete for the purposes of the EAC Tariff Nomenclature.

All the constituent parts must be imported through the same entry point within the allowed time. However, in special cases,	the	competent	authorities	may	authorize	importation	through	several	points	of	entry.	This	time	limit	may	not be	exceeded	unless	a	reasoned	and	justified	request	for	an	extension	is	made	to	the	competent	authorities.

Upon each partial importation, a list of the parts making up the consignment with references to the above mentioned general inventory must be provided. The customs declaration for each consignment must contain descriptions of both the part or parts making up the consignment and the complete prefabricated building.
