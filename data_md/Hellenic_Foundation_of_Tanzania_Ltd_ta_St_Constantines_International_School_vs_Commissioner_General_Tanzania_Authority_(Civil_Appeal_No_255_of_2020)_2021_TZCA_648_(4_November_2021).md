## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

18t h  October &amp; 4t h  November. 2021

## KAIRO, J.A.:

This  is  an  appeal  against  the  judgment  and  decree  of  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal)  dated  the  28t h   day of January, 2020 in Tax Appeal  No.  17 of 2019. The factual  background culminating to this appeal is as follows:-

The appellant is a  corporate body engaged in providing education to the public.  It owns and operates nursery,  primary and secondary schools in the name of St. Constantine's International School in Arusha.

On  20t h   June,  2017,  the  respondent  served  the  appellant  with  a letter indicating  that  it  had defaulted in the  payment  of  Skills  and Development  Levy  (hereinafter  SDL)  for  years  of  income  2013  through 2017. Thereafter,  it  proceeded to issue certificates of assessment of the SDL for the years in question  plus interests thereon.  Upon  receipt of the said certificates, on 29t h  November,  2017, the appellant lodged notices of objection against the assessments made. After some  exchange  of proposals for the settlement on the adjusted  assessments,  on  10t h  April, 2018, the appellant received Notices of Confirmation of Assessment which it was asked to settle.

Aggrieved,  the  appellant lodged Tax appeals  Nos.  209,  210,  211  and 212,  all  of  2018  before  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  Board) complaining against the imposition of SDL to the appellant for the reason that it was exempted from such liability.

The issues before the Board were one, whether the SDL assessments were lawful and justifiable; two, whether the appellant qualified for SDL payment  exemption.  The  appeals  were  later  consolidated,  argued  and determined together as appeal No. 209 of 2018. The Board dismissed the appeal after finding that the appellant was not a charitable organization, thus liable to pay the SDL. The Board also found that, the respondent had

conducted due diligence on the status of the appellant and satisfied that the appellant's entity did not qualify as an exempted charitable organization  under  the  provisions  of  section  19  (2)  of  the  Vocational Education  and  Training  Act,  Cap.  82  R.E.  2006  [as  amended  by  the Finance Act, 2014] (the VETA Act).

The appellant was further aggrieved and  lodged an appeal  before the Tax Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) which sustained the Board's decision, hence this appeal on three grounds of appeal as follows: -

- 1.  That the Honourable Tribunal erred in both law and fact by holding that the appellant is not a charitable organization in terms of  section 19 (2) of the  Vocational Education and  Training Act,  Cap.82 R.E. 2006  as  amended  by  the  Finance  Act,  2014  regardless  of an admission by the respondent in the pleadings to the contrary.
- 2.  That  the  Honourable  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  holding  that  the appellant is liable for the payment of Skills and Development Levy on the basis of an assumption that the respondent had conducted due diligence  without any proof and without any pleading on that regard by the respondent.
- 3.  That having held that there is no any  procedure for conducting due diligence on the status of  the appellant in respect of  chargeabiiity of SDL,  and having held that there  was no proof that due diligence was conducted by the respondent, the Honourable Tribunal erred in

law by holding that the appellant is liable to pay SDL  without dear provision of  the law.

When  the  appeal  was  called  on  for  hearing,  the  appellant  was represented  by  Mr. Edward  Peter  Chuwa,  learned  counsel  while  the respondent  had  the  services  of  Messrs.  Harold  Gugami  and  Amandus Ndayeza, together with Ms. Grace Makoa, all Senior State Attorneys.

Mr.  Chuwa  adopted  the appellant's written  submissions  in  support of the appeal  before addressing  us orally on some of the aspects of the appeal.

In essence,  the  submissions  of  Mr.  Chuwa  on  the  1 s t   ground, revolves around the issues whether the respondent by noting some of the appellant's statements of facts in  the appeal  amounted  to an  admission and whether the appellant is a charitable organization in terms of section 19 (2) of the VETA Act as amended by the Finance Act, 2014.

Mr.  Chuwa  argued  that  by  noting  the  appellant's  pleadings  before the  Board  and Tribunal,  the  respondent admitted that the appellant is a charitable  organization  doing  business  for  the  public  good  and  thus eligible  for  SDL exemption  under the VETA Act.  He  impressed  on  us on the  cherished  legal  principle  that  parties  are  bound  by  their  pleadings citing  the  case  of Pauline  Samson  Ndawavya  v.  Theresia  Thomas

Madaha, Civil Appeal No.  45  of  2017  (unreported)  to  back  up  his argument.

In  his  reply, Mr.  Gugami  who  had  adopted  the  contents  of  his written  submissions conceded  that the  respondent's  noting  the contents of paras  3.1.1,  3.1.2  and  3.1.3  of the  statements  of the  appeal  filed  by the appellant at the Board did  not amount to admission of the assertions therein. He argued that the two words are not synonymous. In elaboration,  Mr.  Gugami  stated  that,  the  word  "noted"  was  an  evasive answer which  means that the  respondent  neither admitted  nor disputed the  asserted  facts.  Alternatively,  even  if  he  did,  his  admission  did  not supersede the requirement of section 19 (2) of the VETA Act.

We are mindful of the principle that parties are bound  by their own pleadings as reiterated in many  cases  including, Pauline  Samson Ndawavya (supra).  However,  in  the  appeal  at  hand  we  do  not  agree that by noting the appellant's averments in the statements of appeal, the respondent admitted that the appellant was exempted from  paying  SDL We  think  that  by  noting  the  contents  of the  aforesaid  paragraphs,  the respondent  did not  dispute  the  appellant's  assertions  that  it  was  a registered  international  school  providing  nursery,  primary and  secondary education;  that  the  appellant  was  a   registered  charitable  organization;

and that its business was for the  public good.  However,  we  note that in paragraph  7  of  its  replies  to  the  statements  of  appeal,  at  pages  145 through  148  of  the  record  of  appeal,  the  respondent  pleaded  that  the appellant  was  liable  to  pay  SDL.  This  averment  crucially  negated  any impression  that  the  respondent  admitted  the  claimed  exemption  from SDL.  That  said,  we  find  no  merit  in  the  1 s t   ground  of  appeal  and  we dismiss it.

As  for  the  2n d   and  3r d   grounds  of  appeal,  M r.  Chuwa's  contention was that it was an error for the Tribunal to hold that the appellant is liable to pay SDL basing on assumption that due diligence was conducted while there  is  no  proof  to  that  effect  nor  any  procedure  for  conducting  it  in place.  The  crux  of  his  submission  was  two  pronged: one, what  was pleaded  and  submitted, two, on  the  principles  of  interpretation  of  tax statutes.

Mr.  Chuwa  faulted  the  Tribunal  in  upholding  the  Board's  decision that due diligence was done despite its finding that section  19  (2) of the VETA was  silent  on  the  modality  of conducting  the  same.  According  to him, that reasoning  was  not  backed by  the pleadings, neither  any evidence on record while the fact that it was not done is supported by the pleadings of the appellant. It was  his further submission  that the  mere

fact  that  the  respondent  was  in  possession  of  the  appellant's  business documents  could  not  be  the  basis  of  holding  that  due  diligence  was conducted. He argued that, if due diligence would have been done on the basis of the said  documents, the  respondent would  have confirmed that the  appellant  was  providing  education  for  the  public  good,  thus  not subject to  SDL  payment.  He  also  contended  that  neither the  Board  nor the  Tribunal  considered  exhibit  Al;  a  certificate  of  registration  of  the appellant  and  exhibit  A2;  a  letter  from  the  Ministry  of  Education  and Vocational  Training  addressed  to  the  Permanent  Secretary,  Ministry  of Finance  dated  26t h   March,  2014.  Had  they  done  so,  he  argued,  they would  not  have  reached  wrong  decisions  as  they  did. In  addition,  he contended  that  having  found  that  section  1 1   of the  Tax  Administration Act, 2015 which provides for private ruling and the Income Tax Act, 2004 were not applicable, the Tribunal should not have concluded that the final assessment of the SDL verified  that the  respondent  had  conducted  due diligence.

Mr.  Chuwa  submitted  further that the  decisions  of the  Board  and Tribunal  were  based  on  assumptions and  incorrect understanding  of the law  which  was  an  error  on  their  part. He  elaborated  that,  the  legal provisions  which  creates  tax  liability  have  to  be  strictly  adhered  and should  there  be  any  ambiguity  or  uncertainty,  the  same  has  to  be interpreted  in  favour  of  the  taxpayer.  He  referred  us  to  the  cases  of North  Mara  Gold  Mine  Limited  vs.  Commissioner General  (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 78  of  2015  and Bulyanhulu  Gold  Mine  Ltd  vs. Commissioner General (TRA), Consolidated Civil Appeals Nos. 89 &amp; 90 of 2015 (both unreported) to bolster his argument.  Mr. Chuwa concluded by urging the Court to allow the appeal with costs.

In  rebuttal,  Mr.  Gugami  refuted  the  appellant's  argument that the respondent did  not address the  legal  points in  his submission  before the Board.  He  elaborated  that  the  respondent  thoroughly  submitted  before the Board on the applicability of the VETA Act as well as section  1 1  of the Tax Administration Act,  2015  while addressing  the  legal  points  raised  by the appellant. He also refuted the appellant's submission that the respondent did not conduct due diligence.

Regarding the appellant's contention that neither the Board  nor the Tribunal  considered  exhibits  A1  and  A2,  the  learned  counsel  submitted that the said evidence  had  nothing to do with  proof of the status of the appellant as a charitable organization for the purpose of exemption from SDL.  He argued that the determining factor on the status of the appellant is  stipulated  in  section  1 9   (1)  and  (2)  of the VETA Act which  deals with

the SDL exemption regime and which is at the centre of contention in the appeal.  He  rebutted  the  appellant's  submission  that  the  Board  and  the Tribunal's decisions to subject the appellant to SDL payment were based on assumptions and argued that the decisions hinged on section  19 (2) of the  VETA  Act  whereby  the  respondent  was  satisfied  that  the  appellant was not eligible for exemption  from  SDL liability.  He also added that the Tribunal  sustained  the  Board's  decision  on  the  ground  that,  issuance  of the  final  assessments  by  the  respondent  after  the  objection  settlement verified  that  the  respondent  was  satisfied  that  the  appellant  was  not  a charitable organization eligible for SDL exemption.  He concluded that the position of the law in this matter particularly section  19 (1) and (2) of the VETA Act is clear and free from any ambiguity or uncertainty to warrant its  interpretation  in favour of the appellant.  As such,  he argued the cited cases of North Mara Gold Mine Limited and Bulyanhulu Gold Mine Limited (supra) are distinguishable to the instant appeal.

In his brief rejoinder,  Mr. Chuwa repeated what he had submitted in chief and prayed the Court to allow the appeal with costs.

Having  examined  the  competing  arguments  on  the  2n d   and  3r d grounds,  the  issue  for  our  determination  is  whether  the  Tribunal  was correct in  upholding  the  Board's finding  that the  appellant was  liable to pay SDL as assessed by the respondent.

It  is  trite  that  the  chargeability  of SDL  regime  is  governed  by  the VETA Act. Section 14 (1) the VETA Act provides:

"14.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this Part,  there shall be charged,  levied and payable to the Commissioner at the  end of every month, from every employer who has in his employment four or more employees, a levy to be known as the skills and development levy."

However,  the  Act  exempts  some  organizations  from  payment  of  SDL including a charitable organization  under the provisions of section  1 9   (1) of the VETA Act which stipulates:

"19(1).  The provision of  section 14 shall not apply to:

## (f) Charitable organizations,

The term charitable organization has been defined under section 19 (2) of VETA Act as hereunder: -

"19(2). For  the  purpose  of  this  section, charitable organization means  resident entity of a public character registered as

such and  performs its functions solely for:

- (a) N/A
- (b) Provision of  education or public health, and  the Commissioner  Genera / is upon due diligence making, satisfied that the business conducted by such entity is for public good. "  [Emphasis supplied]

The  appellant's  case  has  been  that  it  is  involved  in  providing education  to  the  public,  thus  a  charitable  organization  exempted  from paying  SDL. However,  from  the  quoted provisions, for a charitable organization  to  be  so  treated  for  the  purpose  of  SDL  exemption,  the condition set out under section 19 (2) of the VETA Act has to be satisfied. We  have  found  no  evidence  in  the  record  of  appeal  proving  that  the appellant met  the  condition. Thus, Mr  Chuwa's  argument  that  the appellant  was  subjected  to  pay  SDL  basing  on  uncertain  or  ambiguous provision of the law, holds no water. In the same vein, the cited cases of North  Mara Gold  Mine Limited {supra) and Bulyanhulu  Gold  Mine Limited {supra) are irrelevant.

We  noted  a  sharp  disagreement  between  the  learned  counsel  for the  parties  on  whether  or  not  the  respondent  conducted  due  diligence

pursuant to section  19  (2) of the VETA Act to determine if the appellant was an exempted organization within the meaning of the said provisions. In our view, the issue in the context of this matter is not whether or not due  diligence  was  conducted. We  think  since  the  appellant  was  an employer within the meaning of section  14 (1) of the VETA Act who has in  its  employment four or  more employees was  liable to  pay SDL at the end  of  every  month  unless  it  had  satisfied  the  respondent  that  it  was entitled to an exemption from  paying the levy pursuant to section  1 9  (2) of the  VETA  Act. We are  also  of the  view  that  section  1 9   (2)  has  no automatic  application  to  exempt  employers  from  payment  of  SDL.  In order for the respondent to be satisfied that the appellant as an employer was not liable to pay SDL it was incumbent upon the appellant to furnish necessary  documentation  or  other  evidence  to  establish  that  it  is  a charitable organization providing education for the public good.

As the appellant was in  existence when the  law on  SDL came into force, logic and common sense would dictate that evidence ought to have been  furnished  to  the  respondent  as  soon  as  possible.  In  this  appeal, there is no proof that the appellant furnished any evidence,  at least until when the assessments were made by the respondent.  Regardless of the finding  by the  Board  that there  exists  no  procedure  for  conducting  due

diligence  under section  19 (2) of the VETA Act, the issue whether or not due  diligence  was  conducted  on  the  appellant  does  not  arise  in  the present circumstances. On that basis, we find no merit in the 2n d  and 3r d grounds of appeal. They stand dismissed.

Having  so  found,  we  find  nothing  to  fault  the  decision  of  the Tribunal. Consequently, we dismiss the appeal in its entirety with costs.
