## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

2nd  June &amp; 13t h  October, 2023

## LEVIRA. J.A.:

The appellant, Game Discount World Tanzania Limited, a company trading  in  both  locally  made  and  imported  goods  tost  before  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  at  Dar  es  Salaam  (the  Tribunal)  where  she had  appealed  in  Tax  Appeal  No.  26  of  2020  (subject  of  this  appeal) against the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board at Dar es Salaam (the Board). Before the Board, the appellant unsuccessfully challenged the respondent's assessment and decision on tax  demand  of TZS.2,766,872,664.92 advancing  three grounds;  to wit, underevaluation of imported goods; split of head office costs recoveries

and  warehousing  costs;  and,  undeclared  foreign  transport  costs.  As intimated above, the Tribunal upheld the decision of the  Board where it stated  that,  the  Board  was  right  in  holding  that  the  respondent  was justified to assess and demand payment  of  tax liability of  TZS. 1,589,305,287.57 on warehousing costs and additional duties on import VAT amounting to TZS.  1,218,440,122.62 on foreign transport costs.

A  brief  background  of  this  matter  according  to  the  record  of appeal  and  as  introduced  above  is  that,  the  appellant  is  a  company incorporated  in Tanzania  as subsidiary of Masstores  Proprietary  Limited based  and  registered  in  South  Africa. The appellant  being  a  company trading  as  a  super  store  in  both  locally  manufactured,  produced  and imported goods is subject to respondent's tax audit.

The dispute between the parties herein arose when the respondent  conducted  a  post  clearance  tax  audit  covering  years  of income 2012, 2013 and 2014 and prepared a report which was objected by the appellant.  The  audit was  aimed  at verifying  the  appellant's  tax compliance.  After  completion  of  the  audit,  the  respondent  issued  a demand  notice  for  payment  of  short  levied  duties  amounting  TZS. 3,890,948,213.78. However,  the  appellant  was  not  satisfied  and  thus lodged a complaint  with the respondent  where  that  amount  was reviewed  and  the demand was reduced to TZS.  2,886,323,526.41. The

appellant paid TZS.  119,450,861.49 remaining with a balance of TZS.2,766,872,664.92 allegedly resulting from underdeclared warehousing  costs  and  foreign  transport  costs. It transpired  that,  the appellant disputed the said  balance and thus unsuccessfully appealed to the  Board  and  Tribunal;  hence,  the  present  appeal.  The  appellant  has presented  before  us  five  grounds  of appeal,  which  for  the  reasons  to come into light shortly, we shall  not reproduce all of them herein except the first ground, which reads:

- "1.  The Hon.  Vice Chairperson erred by misinterpreting the  appiication  o f paragraph  9  (2)  (b)  o f  the Fourth  Schedule  to  the  East African  Community Customs Management Act in connection with head office  costs  recoveries  subject  o f  the  disputed customs  and  excise  taxes  leading  to  erroneous finding that head office costs are part of warehousing  costs  which  ought  to  have  been declared by the Appellant as part o f  customs value o f stock,  that is,  goods for  valuation  o f imported goods for tax purposes, resulting in undervaluation o f vatable supplies."

At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was represented by Dr. Alexander X  Nguluma,  learned  advocate,  whereas  the  respondent  had the services of Ms.  Consolatha Andrew, learned  Principal  State Attorney

assisted  by Mses.  Grace  Makoa and Juliana  Ezekiel,  both  learned  Senior State Attorneys.

Before  hearing  of  the  appeal  could  take  place  in  earnest,  we engaged the parties in a brief dialogue regarding the propriety of appeal in terms of section 25 (2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap 408 R.E. 2019  (the TRAA). Dr.  Nguluma was quick to  realize  and  respond  that four  grounds  of appeal  out  of five  presented  were  not  pure  points  of law;  a  position  which  was  also  shared  by  Ms.  Andrew.  He  therefore abandoned the said  four grounds. As a  result,  the  parties agued  only the  first  ground  of appeal  which  was  on  pure  point  of  law  as  quoted above.

Dr.  Nguluma  adopted the appellant's written submissions and  the list of authorities he had filed  in  Court on  18th   March 2022 and 29th  May 2023  respectively,  to  form  part  of  his  oral  arguments.  Thereafter,  he submitted that the contentious issue in this appeal  is the  interpretation of paragraph 9 (2) (b) of Fourth Schedule to the East African Community Customs  Management Act,  2004  (the  EACCMA)  which  was relied  upon  by  the  Tribunal  holding  that  head  office  recoveries  and warehousing costs are one and the same while evaluating the appellant's tax liability. According to him, that interpretation was wrong. He referred us to page 1452 of the record of appeal where the Tribunal observed that Head office costs recoveries are part of warehousing costs and  as  such,  ought to  have  been  declared  by  the  appellant  as  part of costs of goods for valuation of imported goods for customs purposes as required  by  the  above  paragraph. He  argued  that the  finding  by  the Tribunal  was  wrong  because  the  appellant  provided  her  head  office's account to  the  respondent  to justify  how  the  warehousing  costs  were derived  by  showing  her  new  treatment  of  warehousing  costs  and  the applicable supplier's rebates.

He  submitted  further  in  respect  of costs  incurred  in  running  the warehouse;  including,  rebates through which the appellant received  her goods for the Tanzania  market. He said,  according to the evidence on record,  Jonathan  Bastow  (AW2)  testified  on  how the arrangement was structured. He elaborated that, when the respondent's  Tax  Audit Department  carried  out  an  audit  of the  books  of  accounts,  it  did  not request  the  cost  for  running  the  center  from  South  Africa. In  the circumstances,  he argued, the appellant discharged  her burden of proof contrary  to  the  observation  made  by  the  Board  and  Tribunal  on  that issue  and  thus  she  cannot  be  faulted. He argued  further that,  it was equally  wrong  for  the  Tribunal  to  address  the  warehousing  costs  in terms  of  their  recovery  and  calculation,  the  split  of  Head  office  costs recoveries and the warehousing costs, the  appellant's trial  balance and

the  new  method  for  charging  warehousing  costs  to  claim  that  these costs were undeclared and that foreign transport costs (loading, unloading  and  handling)  should  be  included  in  the  dutiable  customs value or value of stock/goods. In support of his argument, he cited two persuasive  foreign  authorities  from  Uganda  and  Kenya,  respectively. These were: Auto Express Limited v. The Commissions of Customs  and  Border  Control, Appeal No. 119  of  2018, Kenya Revenue Appeals Tribunal and Testimony Motors Limited v. The Commissioner of Customs, Uganda  Revenue Authority, Civil  Suit No. 212 of 2012.

Dr. Nguluma  emphasized  that  the  matter  before us involves interpretation  of the  EACCMA,  2004  as  related  to  the  interpretation  of goods  imported  in  Tanzania.  According  to  him,  the  Tribunal  failed  to consider  the  method  of  valuation  used  to  determine  tax  payable  to goods imported in Tanzania. He submitted further that, section  122 (1) of  the  EACCMA  provides  for  conditions  as  it  stipulates  that  customs valuation for imported goods liable to ad  valorem  duty shall be determined  in  accordance  with  the  Fourth  Schedule.  In  addition,  he stated,  Paragraph  2 of  Part  1   of the  Fourth  Schedule  specifies that the customs value of imported goods shall be the transaction value, which is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to

the Partner State. Paragraph 2 provides that the customs value shall be the transaction  value  and  it also spell  out the  adjustments to  be  made to the value.

Therefore,  it  was  the  argument  by  Dr. Nguluma  that  although Grace  Julius  Tibanywana  (RW1)  in  her  evidence  doubted  the  values declared  by  the  appellant,  however  she  did  not  place  any  evidence before the Tribunal to support her claim  on  record  but merely asserted at  page  1062  of  the  record  of  appeal  that,  "the  treatment  by  the appellant o f these costs, together with foreign charges o f transport cost formed part  o f the  computation  o f the  duties  and  taxes  under  the custom  laws. Then  based on  that we correctly computed duties and taxes on transport costs."  This, he said, is contrary to the requirements of section  110 of the Evidence Act, Cap 6 R.E. 2019 (the Evidence Act).

He  referred us  to pages  11  to 14  of  the  appellant's  written submissions  where, he said, the  appellant  demonstrated how  she discharged her burden  of  proof  as  she  established  the  costs  and recoveries. Therefore,  he  argued  that  both  the  Board  and  Tribunal failed  to  interpret  head  office  recoveries,  warehouse  recoveries  and transport costs,  as  a  result the Tribunal  misinterpreted  the  costs to  be paid. According to him, these were distinct.  In  the circumstances,  Dr. Nguluma  argued  that  the  Board  and  Tribunal  erred  in  finding  that the

appellant was not entitled to costs recovery on the three items mentioned  above. In  fact,  they  were  entitled,  he  insisted.  Finally,  he prayed for the appeal to be allowed with costs.

Responding  to  the  appellant's  arguments,  Ms.  Andrew  submitted that the dispute between the parties herein started when the respondent conducted  a  post  clearance  tax,  covering  years  of  income 2012,  2013  and  2014. The audit aimed at verifying the appellant's tax compliance. The  respondent discovered that there was noncompliance and  thus  issued  a  demand  notice  for  payment  of  short  levied  duties which the appellant disputed before the Board and Tribunal unsuccessfully.  She adopted the whole decision of the Tribunal  and the respondent's written  submissions as  part of her  submission. She went on to  submit that this  appeal  raises three  issues,  to  wit,  first,  whether the Tribunal erred  by misinterpreting the application of paragraph 9 (2) (b)  of  the  Fourth  Schedule  to  the  EACCMA  in  connection  with  Head Office Costs recoveries subject of the disputed customs and excise taxes leading  to  the  finding  that  Head  Office  Costs  recoveries  are  part  of warehousing costs which ought to have been declared  by the appellant as  part  of customs  value  of  stock. According  to  the  respondent,  the Tribunal did  not error and it did  not misinterpret paragraph 9  (2)  (b) of the  Fourth  Schedule  to  the  EACCMA which  requires  loading,  unloading

and other handling charges associated with transport of imported goods to  be  part  of  the  value  of  stock. According  to  her,  although  the appellant  claimed  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  its  finding,  she  did  not adduce  evidence  to  prove  the  actual  agreements,  actual  warehousing costs  and  the  applicable  supplier's  rebate,  but  it  is  also  true  that  the appellant did  not  prove  the  allegation  that there  was  a  rebate  or  that she  incurred  costs  contrary  to  the  requirements  of  section  111  of the Evidence Act.  In support,  she cited the case of Attorney General and 2  Others  v.  Eligi  Edward  Massawe  and  104  others, Civil  Appeal No.86 of 2002 (unreported).

Ms. Andrew contended that the respondent was justified to assess and  demand  payment  of TZS.  1,589,305,287.57  which  resulted  from underdeclared  warehouse  costs  of  goods  imported  by  the  appellant during the  period  under review. According to her, the appellant use of the  term  "Head  Office  Cost  Recoveries"  is just  a  matter  of  semantics which  should  not distort the  actual  meaning. The  nature  of expenses are warehousing  costs which were  not shown and  stated  as  such.  She referrec|   us  to  page  1723  of the  record  of appeal  and  stated  that  the Tribunal  was  correct  in  its  finding  that,  warehousing  costs  incurred  by the appellant in  importing  goods are part of costs of goods or value of imported goods.

Regarding the appellant's complaint that the Tribunal  did  not follow the sequence of the method of customs valuation provided for under the Fourth Schedule to the EACCMA 2004,  Ms. Andrew supported what was stated  by the Tribunal  in  that respect. Indeed,  she added, that is  how the  respondent  has  been  applying  those  valuation  methods  and  the same  were considered while making valuation of the appellant's imported  goods and finally decided to  make adjustment to the value of imported  goods  in  accordance with  paragraph  9  (2)  because  the  costs were incurred for the benefit of the seller but they were not included in the  price  actually  paid  or  payable. She thus  urged  us  not to  consider the decisions of Uganda and Kenya cited by the appellant because they are  distinguishable  from  the  facts  of the  current  matter.  According  to her,  valuation  of  imported  goods  was  done  in  accordance  with  the Fourth Schedule as required by section  122 of the EACCMA.

Ms.  Andrew  challenged  the  appellant's  submission  in  respect  of Head  Office  costs,  where  it was  claimed  that the  appellant  discharged the  burden  of  proving  that  the  Head  Office  costs  recoveries  do  not include  warehousing  costs,  which  the  respondent  included  in  the  total costs for valuation of imported goods to be purely factual  matters which should not be considered by the Court.  However, without prejudice, she said,  the  ascertainment  by  the  appellant  in  that  respect  is  incorrect

because there was no evidence whatsoever from the appellant's witness to prove that there was a rebate which was higher than the warehousing costs owed to Tanzania Game branch.

Emphatically,  Ms. Andrew submitted that the appellant has treated the  warehousing  costs  twice  differently  and  contradictorily. First, by showing  that  the  costs  are  included  in  the  invoice  of the  stock  before being exported from South Africa to Tanzania and second, that the costs were not paid at all as there was rebates on the years  under review as per the  notice  of intention  to  amend  demand  note  and  the  appellant's letter with  reference to the  notice to amend the demand  note  (Exhibits A1 and  A4  respectively). She  went  on  to  state  that  in 2012  the respondent conducted an audit covering the  period  from  2007 to 2012 which  revealed that the appellant did  not declare warehousing costs as part of the costs for the stock imported  during  the  period  of audit and finally  admitted  the  undervaluation  and  paid  the  resultant  duties  and taxes. In  addition,  she  said,  in  2015  during  an  audit,  it  was  revealed that there  were  undeclared  warehousing  costs  as  usual,  but,  this  time without any proof, the appellant called them Head Office costs recoveries. According  to  Ms.  Andrew,  this  was  another  tax  avoidance plan.

As  regards the  second  issue,  whether the Tribunal  was  correct to hold  that the  respondent was justified  to  assess  and  demand  payment of  tax  liability  on  Head  Office  costs  recoveries,  it  was  her  submission that the respondent was justified to assess and demand payment of tax liability  of TZS.  1,589,305,287.57  on  Head  Office  costs  recoveries  as  it was  correctly  found  by  the  Tribunal,  that  foreign  transport  costs  are dutiable  costs  of  imported  goods. This,  she  said,  is  because  the  law requires  loading,  unloading  and  handling  charges to  be  added  to costs and form part of value of imported goods. Finally,  Ms.  Andrew urged  us to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  rejoinder,  Dr.  Nguluma  reiterated  his  submission  in  chief  and insisted  that  Head  Office  costs  recoveries  are  not  part  of warehousing costs;  therefore,  it  was  wrong  for  the  respondent  to  think  that  the appellant  changed  the  name  to  avoid  tax.  He  urged  us  to  allow  the appeal with costs.

We  have  carefully  considered  the  ground  of  appeal, parties' submissions and the entire record of appeal. The main  issue calling for our determination  is,  whether the Tribunal  erred  by misinterpreting  the application of  paragraph  9 (2) (b)  of  the Fourth  Schedule  to  the EACCMA in connection with the Head Office costs recoveries subject of the disputed customs and excise taxes leading to the finding that Head

Office  costs  recoveries  are  part  of  warehousing  costs  which  ought  to have been declared  by the appellant as part of customs value of stock. It was the appellant's contention that warehousing costs were  part and parcel  of the  Head  Office costs  recoveries and  thus could  not be taken in assessing  the  value  of  stock  of  imported  goods.  This  averment, however,  was  strongly  disputed  by the  respondent  as  she  maintained that  warehousing  costs  must  be  considered  in  assessing  value  of  the stock of imported goods for duty purposes.

According to  Email  printout found  at  page  1015  of the  record  of appeal  (Exhibit  Rl),  costs  relating  to  warehouse  service  were  charged and  pegged  to  the  Head  Office  but was  not declared  for  duty  and  tax purposes during  importation  of the goods.  The  appellant's trial  balance (Exhibit R2) for the respective years under review  reflected the amount incurred as warehousing costs and costs recovery, but such amount was shifted  to  the  Head  Office  costs  recovery  account  while  the  former account  remained  Nil,  the  same  act  is  seen  in  Exhibit  R3  where  the warehousing costs were shifted to Head Office costs recovery account.

It is undisputed fact that the appellant is a subsidiary of Masstores Proprietary Limited with  its Head Office located  in  Durban,  South Africa. The goods were imported in Tanzania (her subsidiary company) but the warehousing  costs  subject of this dispute were  accounted  for  in  South

Africa  (the Head Office) forming  part of the  Head Office costs recovery. Paragraph 9 (2) of the EACCMA, 2004 provides as follows:

- (2)  In determining the  value for duty purpose o f  any imported goods,  there  shail be  added to  the price  actually paid or payable for the goods:
- (a) the cost o f transport o f the imported goods to  the port or place o f  importation into the Partner State; Provided that in case o f  im ports by air no freight cost shall be added to the price paid or  payable;
- (b) loading,  unloading  and handling  charges  associated  with the transport o f the imported goods to the port or place o f importation into the Partner State; and
- (c)  the cost o f  insurance.

The above provision indicates clearly that the value of any imported goods for duty  purposes  is  determined  by  adding  to  the  price  actually paid  or  payable  for  the  goods  the  cost  of  transport  of  the  imported goods to the  port or  place  of importation  into  the  Partner  State.  Also, the cost of loading, unloading and handling associated with the transport of the imported goods to the port or place of importation  into the Partner State add to the value of the said goods. It should be noted that  when  the  language  of  statute  is  clear,  it  is  not  open  to  further interpretation. This position has been stated in a number  of  our decisions  including Standard  Chartered  Bank  (Hong  Cong)  Ltd.  v

Mechmar  Corporation (Malaysia) Berhad &amp;  7 Others, Civil Revision No. 1 of  2012  (unreported),  where  the  Court  quoted  with approval the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R.  Multiform Manufacturing Co, (1990) 2 S. C.  R. 624 where it stated:

"When the courts are called upon to interpret a statute,  their task is to discover the intension o f Parliament.  When the words used in a statute are dear  and unambiguous, no further step Is needed  to  identify  the  intention  o f Parliam ent There is no need for further construction  when Parliament has clearly expressed its intention in the words used in the statute. "

In  the  instant case,  we  are  settled  that the  language  used  in  the provision  under  consideration  is  plain  and  thus  it  did  not  require  any further interpretation.

It is worth noting that the  cases cited by  the appellant  of Testimony Motors Ltd (supra) and Auto Express Limited (supra) of Uganda and Kenya, respectively, are distinguishable from the circumstances of the  current  case.  In  the  case  of Testimony Motors Limited, the issues before the High Court of Uganda were, whether the suspension  of  the  operation  of  the  transaction  value  method  by  the defendant contravened the provisions of section  122 of the EACCMA and if  the  first  issue  is  answered  in  favour  of  the  plaintiffs,  whether  the

plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  reassessment  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The High  Court  of  Uganda  mainly  dealt  with  the  applicability  of  Order  37 Rule 6 of Civil  Procedure Code of Uganda  in determining the first issue. It  went  further  stating  that  it  is  supposed  to  determine  the  question whether  the  directive  of  the  Commissioner  of  Customs  of  Uganda Revenue  Authority  to  suspend  the  operation  of  the  transaction  value method  set  out  under  section  122  and  the  Fourth  Schedule  of  the EACCMA is lawful. This is a  question of enforcement of the Act and  not construction  of  section  122  of  the  EACCMA  and  thus  distinguishable from the facts of current matter as alluded to above.

Likewise, in the latter case of Kenya, the court dealt with the issue as to whether the respondent's act of departing from transactional value method in evaluating the appellant's goods  without  affording the appellant an opportunity to justify the values declared was lawful. While, in  the  present case,  the  Court  is enjoined  to  interpret  paragraph  9  (2) (b) of  the Fourth Schedule  to the EACCMA  as  quoted  above  in determining the custom value of imported goods by the appellant.

We are aware that in terms of section 25 (1) of the TRAA appeals to the Court against the decisions of the Tribunal are on  matters of law only. However, although the appellant's complaint hinges on the misinterpretation of the application of paragraph  9 (2) (b) of the Fourth

Schedule  to  the  EACCMA  which  is  a  point  of  law,  the  appellant  has raised  factual  issues  which  were  finally  dealt  with  before  the  Tribunal and this should not have been reopened before the Court.

Without prejudice to the aforesaid, in the instant case, the appellant undeclared warehousing costs and further shifted the same as it appears in her trial  balance to the Head Office recovery costs. Thus,  it is  obvious that the  appellant did  not declare the  warehousing  costs  as part of the cost of the imported goods for duty purpose.

Also,  regarding  the cost of imported  goods on foreign transport. It  is  the  appellant's  argument  that  the  cost  of  transport  of  imported goods (stock) as seen in  the trial  balance were  in  respect of the goods imported  in  previous  period  and  sold  during  the  years  under  review. However, the respondent disputes this averment on the ground that the appellant has not given any proof on such contention.  For example, she has not stated the closing  balance of the stock for the respective years, what were added to the stock and what part of the previous stock was sold during the years  under review.  So,  in the absence of cogent proof in terms of section 110 of the Evidence Act, the respondent was justified to assess and demand tax on undeclared foreign transport costs.

In the circumstances, the raised issue is negatively answered and the appeal is without merit. We dismiss it with costs.
