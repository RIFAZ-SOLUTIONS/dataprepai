## RULING

3"'July, 2023

## MGONYA. J.A.:

The Applicant herein is moving the Court under rules 4 (2) (a) (b), 10 and 96 (6) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules 2009 (hereinafter the  Rules)  so  that  it  enlarges  the  time  within  which  she  can  file  a supplementary record of appeal. In support of the notice of motion the

Applicant filed an affidavit sworn by Mr. Wilson Kamugisha Mukebezi, the Applicant's legal counsel.

Brief facts  of what triggered  this  application  as  can  be  gathered from  the  Applicant's  Affidavit  goes  thus;  On  23r d   January,  2015  the Applicant lodged  in the Tax Appeals Board (the Board) an appeal which was registered as Tax Appeal  No.  4 of 2015,  against the  Respondent's decision  to  impose Value  Added Tax  on  her  imported  services.  On  9t h February  2018, the Board  delivered its decision in favour  of  the Respondent.  On  19t h  February,  2018,  the  Applicant  requested  for  the certified copies of  documents that were tendered as exhibits in Tax Appeal No.  4  of  2015.  She  then  filed  an  Appeal  to the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) which was registered as Tax Appeal No. 28 of 2018 in order to challenge the Board's decision.  Having heard the appeal, the Tribunal  upheld  the  Board's  decision.  Being  aggrieved,  the  Applicant successful filed an application for extension of time to file an Appeal to the Court out of time, as he was already out of time. On 11t h  May, 2021 the Applicant wrote to the Tribunal requesting for certified copies of the proceedings,  ruling  and  drawn  order  in  Application  No.  41  of  2020

(Annexture SCTL3 to the Affidavit). She also wrote a  letter requesting for the endorsed exhibits which were tendered at the  Board  in Tax Appeal No. 4 of 2015 (Annexture STCL 4).

The Applicant deponed further that, on 29t h  June 2021, she wrote another letter requesting the Board to supply her with certified copies of tendered exhibits (Annexture SCTL 5). Those documents were not availed to her in time, therefore she lodged Civil Appeal No. 264 of 2021, without the requisite documents hoping that they will be supplied to her within 14 days,  the  time  prescribed  in  the  Rules.  Unfortunately,  upon  several reminder's,  she  was  supplied  with  the  requested  documents  on  10t h August, 2021 (annexture SCTL 7) which was hopelessly out of time, hence this application.

The Applicant's ground for filing this application is as it appears in the Notice of Motion that: On 12t h  July, 2021, she lodged before this court a record of appeal in Civil Appeal No. 264 of 2021. However, she did not attach  necessary  documents  which  includes;  certified  copies  of  the tendered exhibits in Tax Appeal No.4 of 2015, the certified copies of the proceedings,  Ruling and  Drawn Order of the Tribunal in Tax Application

No. 41 of 2020 which granted her extension of  time to file Notice of  Appeal out of time to the Court of Appeal, the endorsed exhibits and the notice of appeal to the Tax Board in Tax Appeal No. 2 of 2015.

During the hearing of this Application, Mr. Wilson Mukebezi learned Counsel  appeared  for  the  Applicant,  while  nobody  appeared  for  the Respondent despite being duly summoned, hence the hearing proceeded ex  parte against the Respondent.  During the hearing, Counsel Mukebezi reiterated what he deposed  in  his Affidavit that,  he seeks  leave of this Court  to  lodge  Supplementary  Affidavit  of Appeal  in  order  to  include exhibits which were tendered before the Board in Civil Appeal No. 261 of 2021  which  is  pending  before  this  Court.  By  referring  this  Court  to paragraph  14  of  the  Affidavit,  he  submitted  that,  the  Applicant  was supplied  with  the  records of the  proceedings and  proceeded  to file an appeal without including the exhibits. Unfortunately, the 14 days in which she would have applied to lodge the supplementary record without leave lapsed before the Applicant was availed with the said documents. It was further submission that, as the nature of the prayer do not prejudice the Respondent and also the proceedings will enable this Court to reach to a fair decision. In the premises he prayed that the Applicant be granted the under sought.

Having  heard  the  Applicant's  Counsel  then  the  issue  before  this Court is whether the Applicant deserves the extension of time or not.

The Applicant filed this application on 13t h  August, 2021, the same is  not  resisted  by  the  Respondent  as  up  to  the  moment  when  the application  was  called  for  hearing  as  the  Respondent  neither  filed  an affidavit in  reply nor appeared before this Court as stated earlier although there is a proof of service.

As per rule 10 of the Rules the extension of time is granted where the Applicant  has shown  good  cause for the delay.  The good  cause  is determined by considering various factors, including promptness in taking action  after  one  has  learned  of  the  delay,  considering  whether  the Applicant has accounted for each delayed day, and the existence of the sufficient  point  of  law  such  as  illegality  of  the  decision  sought  to  be impugned.  See; Lyamuya Construction Company Ltd v.  Board of Registered Trustees of Young Women's Christian Association of Tanzania, Civil Application  No. 2 of 2010 [2011] TZCA 4;  [03 October, 2011,  TANZLII], Ngao  Godwin  Losero  v.  Julius  Mwarabu, Civil 5

Application No.  10 of 2015 and Regional Manager Tanroads Kagera v. Ruaha Concrete Company Limited, Civil Application No. 96 of 2007 all unreported. In Lyamuya Construction case (supra) this Court stated that:

"As  a  matter  o f general principle , it  is  in  the discretion of  the Court to  grant  extension of  time. But that discretion is  judicial,  and so it must be exercised according to the rules of reason and justice,  and not according to private opinion or arbitrarily. On the authorities however, the following  guidelines may  be formulated: -

- (a) The  applicant  must  account  for  all  the  period of  delay;
- (b) The delay  should  not  be inordinate;
- (c)  The applicant must show diligence,  and not apathy, negligence or  sioppiness in the prosecution of the action that he intends to take; and
- (d)  I f  the court  feels  that  there  are other  sufficient reasons, such as  the existence o f  a  point  of  law of  sufficient importance; such as the illegality of  the decision sought  to be challenged."

In the instant application as indicated above, the applicant asks for enlargement of time within which to file the omitted documents in record of appeal.  The  right to  file the omitted  documents  has  been  provided under Rule 96(6) of the Rules. The said Rule provides that:

"(6) Where a document referred to in rule 96(1) and (2) is omitted from the record of  appeal the appellant  may within fourteen days of  lodging the record of appeal,  without prior permission  and thereafter, informally,  with the permission of  the Registrar,  include the document in the record of appeal  by  lodging an additional  record  of  appeal "

Also Rule 96(7) of the Rules provides that where the case is called on for hearing, the Court is of opinion that document referred to in Rule 96(1)  and  (2)  is omitted from the record  of appeal,  it may on  its own motion or upon an  informal Application grant leave to the Appellant to lodge a supplementary record of appeal.

By referring to Rule 96(1) of the Rules, it is observed that the record of appeal must include the certified copies of the proceedings, judgment

or  ruling,  decree  or  order  and  other  necessary  documents  for  proper determination of the Appeal.

It  is  garnered  from  the  Applicant's  affidavit  that  the  omitted documents she intends to file includes the certified copies of exhibits, the ruling,  proceedings and decree of the Board. As to when those omitted records were supposed to be filed without a leave, as per the wording of Rule 96(6) of the  Rules,  counting  from when the  record of appeal  was filed which is on 12t h  July, 2021 (Paragraph 10 of the Affidavit), then the same were supposed to be filed on or before 26t h  July, 2021. But due to the reasons deposed of in the Affidavit the same were not filed within the prescribed time limit.

In this application since what is sought is extension of time to file the omitted documents because, the Applicant was delayed to be availed with the said documents by the Board;  I find that good cause has been shown in explaining the delay was not on account of the Applicant's fault. Thus,  for  better  meeting  the  ends of justice,  I  find  that the Applicant deserves the extension of time to file the supplementary record.

Accordingly, the supplementary record of appeal mentioned in the affidavit shall be lodged within seven days from the date of this order.

It is so ordered.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 3r d  day of July, 2023.
