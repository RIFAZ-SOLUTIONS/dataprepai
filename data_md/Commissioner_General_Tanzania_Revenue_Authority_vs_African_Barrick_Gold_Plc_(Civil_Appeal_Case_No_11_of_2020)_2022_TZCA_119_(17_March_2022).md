## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

14th  &amp;&amp; 17t h  March, 2022

## MUGASHA. J.A.:

The  appellant, the Commissioner  General of  Tanzania Revenue Authority  (the  CGTRA)  is  challenging  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals  Tribunal  (the  Tribunal)  which  sustained  the  decision  of  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board).

From what can be discerned in the record before us, the background to  the  present  appeal  is  briefly  as  follows:  the  respondent  is  a  company incorporated  in  the  United  Kingdoms  (UK)  and  registered  to  carry  on

mining and exploration business in Tanzania through its subsidiaries among them  being  the  Nyanzaga  Gold  Exploration  (Nyanzaga  Project)  located  in Sengerema  District,  Mwanza  Region  operated  by  Nyanzaga  Exploration Company  Limited.  The  project  was  initially jointly  owned  by Tusker  Gold Limited  incorporated  in  Australia  through  its  subsidiary  company  named Sub-Sahara Resources Limited registered in Tanzania on one hand, and the respondent through Barrick Exploration African Limited, a company registered in Tanzania on the other hand. Tusker Gold Limited owned 49% interest  in  the Nyanzaga  Project,  whereas,  the  respondent  owned  the remaining 51% interest in the project.

Sometimes in  2010,  the  respondent through  its subsidiary  company registered  in  UK named  BUK Holdco Limited acquired 49%  interest owned by Tusker Gold  Limited on Australian Stock Exchange  under a compulsory acquisition scheme. Following the acquisition, the Nyanzaga Project became  wholly  owned  by  the  respondent  through  BUK  Holdco  Limited. Having  gathered  that  the  transaction  involved  acquisition  of  interest  in Nyanzaga  Project located in Tanzania and  it attracted tax in Tanzania, the appellant  drew  this  to  the  attention  of  the  respondent  who  in  return, disputed the tax liability on the ground that, the share sale transaction was

between the companies registered outside the United Republic of Tanzania. Thus, the appellant invoked the provisions of section 35 of the Income Tax Act  [CAP  332  R.E.  2002]  and  notified  the  respondent that,  the  share sale transaction was a tax avoidance arrangement and required her to settle the unpaid  tax  immediately  upon  receipt  of  the  notice.  It  is  the  said  letter which prompted the respondent to lodge an appeal to the Board.

Before  the Board,  the  appeal was  confronted  with  a notice of preliminary objection  premised on one ground that, the appeal was bad in law for being  instituted  prematurely before  issuance of a Tax Assessment. The  preliminary  objection  was  heard  alongside  the  substantive  appeal. Ultimately,  the  Board  was  satisfied  that  the  notice  of  the  appellant  was appealable  having  being  couched  in  a  manner constituting  an  assessment and  imposed tax  liability on the respondent. As to the substantive appeal, the  Board  held  that,  since  the  share  sale  transaction  took  place  outside Tanzania  involving  two  foreign  companies  registered  abroad,  it  was  not subject to tax under the laws of Tanzania.

Undaunted,  the  appellant  unsuccessfully  lodged  an  appeal  to  the Tribunal  which  sustained  the  decision  of  the Board  and  this  is  what

prompted the appellant to lodge the present appeal.  In the  Memorandum of Appeal, the appellant has fronted the following grounds of complaint:

- 1. That the Tax Revenue Tribunal erred in law in refusing to admit documentary evidence submitted by the appellant.
- 2. That the Tax Revenue Tribunal erred both in law and fact in  holding that the notice issued by the appellant under section  35 of ITA  constituted an appealable decision  or act under section 14(2) of the  Tax Revenue Appeal Act , Cap 408 R.E 2006 and section 6 of  the Tanzania Revenue Authority  Act, Cap 399 R.E  2006.
- 3. That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred both in law and fact when it held that the transaction related to this case was not taxable under the Income Tax Act.

To bolster their arguments,  parties filed  written  submissions for and against  the  appeal.  At  the  hearing,  the  appellant  was  represented  by Messrs. Deodatus Nyoni, learned Principal State Attorney, Hospis Maswanyla, Harold Gugami, learned Senior State Attorneys and Ms. Salome Chamboi,  learned  State Attorney.  The  respondent  had  the services of Mr. Allan  Kileo,  learned counsel.  Both  learned counsel  adopted their respective submissions earlier on filed.

We have gathered that the 2n d  ground of appeal  involves a question of law which has a bearing on the propriety or otherwise of  the proceedings and decisions of both the  Board and the Tribunal  and subject of the appeal before us. Thus, it shall be addressed first.

At the outset, we have noted that, before the Board and the Tribunal parties parted ways on the status of the appellant's letter as to whether it constituted  an  assessment  imposing  a tax  liability on the  respondent. The letter in question which is at page 12 of the record of appeal is reproduced hereunder:

Dear  Sir/Madam,

## NOTICE UNDER SECTION 35 OF THE INCOME TAX  ACT, CAP 332 (R.E. 2006).

In pursuance of  the powers conferred upon the Commissioner by the provisions of  section 35 of  the Income Tax Act, CAP. 332 (R.E.2006)

you are hereby notified that  your company is held liable to tax in the United  Republic  of  Tanzania  (URT)  on  investment  income  that accrued on  sale  of interest in  land on  Nyanzaga  project  which  is located in the United Republic of Tanzania.  The arrangement of  sale and acquisition  of the said property involved appointment of one associate company ofABG to transact on her behalf.

African Barrick Gold  (ABG)  initiated  a  process  of  compulsory acquisition on Tusker shares in Australia stock exchange with a view of owning  Nyanzaga  Gold  Project  which  is  located  at  Nyanzaga Sengerema  District  Mwanza  Region  in  Tanzania. The  process  of acquisition  involved  a'  series  of  transactions  using  a  subsidiary company of  ABG which was commissioned to handle the acquisition of shares  of  Tusker  Gold  Limited  in  the  stock  exchange  share transfer and ultimately the ownership of Nyanzaga landed into the hands of  ABG.

The company had interest of  acquisition of  Nyanzaga project and it did not acquire it directly, but employed a scheme which made.  The transaction to be seen as a foreign transaction rather than a local one  by  involving  a  subsidiary  company  which  is  located  outside Tanzania.

The purchase of the property was structured in such a way that the transaction  was  to  be  seen  as a  sale  and purchase  of shares by offshore  companies,  but in substance  what was acquired was the property in  Tanzania and not sale of shares per se.  In actual fact what  was  acquired  was  the  property  located in  Tanzania  that  is Nyanzaga.

Following completion of the compulsory acquisition process, African Barrick  Gold  pic's  interest  in  the  Nyanzaga  project  increased  to 100%.  Nyanzaga is now indirectly wholly owned by African Barrick Gold  pic.

The  whole  arrangement  was  meant  for  externalization  of  the acquisition of  the property, though-the said  property is located in the United Republic of Tanzania;  The process was structured in a  way that investment income taxation will be avoided.

In tight of the above  Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) is intending to issue an assessment on investment income as provided for under Sections 9, 39 and 55 of the Income Tax

Act as  ABG  was  owning  the  Nyanzaga  Project  as  a  partner  to Tusker.  BUK Holding the associate company was only a nominee of Barrick in the process of  acquisition of  shares.  The transaction could have been done by ABG itself which had presence in Tanzania.  The adjustment done is based on the sale price of the property which is US $ 71,123,103 times a rate of  30%,  therefore the tax payable is US$21,336,931.

Please, you are required to settle the unpaid tax immediately after receipt, of  this notice.

Yours faithfully,

E.M. Maka  I  a Manager Tax Investigations LAKE  ZONE-MWANZA "

It  seems  to  us  that  in  the  said  letter  of  the  appellant,  the  bolded expressions are not in  harmony.  We say so because, although initially, the appellant had  invoked  the  provisions of section  35  of the  Income Tax Act expressing  intendment to issue an  assessment on  investment income, this is  negated  by the  appellant's demand  on  the  respondent to  settle  unpaid tax immediately after receipt of the notice. Thus, as correctly found  by the Board,  the  appellant's  notice  was  couched  in  a  manner  constituting  an assessment  and it imposed tax liability on the respondent. In the circumstances,  the  contentious  issue here  is  whether  the Board had jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  appeal  against  the  Commissioner  General's letter.

It was  Mr. Maswanyia's  submission  that, even if the notice is assumed to constitute existence of liability, the respondent was not entitled to  appeal to the  Board  considering that,  an  objection  on  existence  of tax liability  has to  be  lodged  with  the  Commissioner General  or  placed  before the  Board  by way of reference  in terms of section  14 (2)  of the TRAA.  In this regard, it was argued that the Board embarked on a nullity to entertain the respondent's appeal  because it had  no jurisdiction to do so. It was Mr. Maswanyia's contention that, the proper course which ought to have been taken by the respondent was to forward the objection  by way of reference to the  Board  as  per the dictates of the provisions of section  14  (2)  of the TRAA. To support his proposition, Mr. Maswanyia urged us to be guided by the case of COMMISSIONER GENERAL TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY VS JSC  ATOMREDMETZOLO  (ARMZ) Consolidated  Civil Appeals Nos 78 and 79 of 2018 (unreported).  He contended the said case to bear a similar factual situation with the matter under scrutiny. Ultimately,  Mr,  Maswanyia  urged the Court to allow the appeal,  nullify the proceedings  of  the  Board  and  Tribunal,  quash  the  respective judgments and subsequent orders.

On the other hand, Mr.  Kileo opposed the appeal and commenced by

## distinguishing the case of COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY VS JSC ATOMREDMETZOLO (ARMZ) (supra)

arguing  that,  in  the  present  matter  the  gist  of  the  dispute  is  a  demand letter to  pay tax  and  not  a  tax  assessment as  prescribed  by  the  law.  He submitted  that,  the  appeal  before the  Board  was filed  under section  6  of the  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  Act  [   CAP  399  R.E.2002]  read  together with section  14 (2) of the TRAA. We probed  Mr.  Kileo on the respondent's written submissions  noting  the  appellant's  contention  that  the  proper remedy was to seek remedy to the Board  by way of reference and  not an appeal. On this,  Mr.  Kileo was of the view that, section  14 (2) of the TRAA has  a lacuna as  it  does  not  provide  for  the  procedure  of  reference  of objection  to  the  Board  and  as  such,  he  argued  the  appeal  to  be  the appropriate  remedy and  which  has  been  the  practice  by  other tax  payers aggrieved  with  the  appellant's  notification  on  existence  of tax  liability.  On being  further  probed  by  the  Court  if the  respondent  had  objected  to  the tax  liability, Mr. Kileo  replied  that  she  never  did  so  be  it  before  the appellant or the  Board  but maintained that recourse to appeal was proper considering that, the appellant was not prejudiced  in  any  manner.  Finally, he urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In a brief rejoinder, Mr. Maswanyia submitted that, since the jurisdiction  of the  Board  is  a  creature  of statute  which  as  well,  stipulates the  manner of dealing  with  objections to tax  liability,  the  respondent  had no choice as she was obliged to forward the objection of the notice on tax liability by way of reference to the Board and not by an appeal. On this, he argued that the case of COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  TANZANIA REVENUE  AUTHORITY  VS JSC  ATOMREDMETZOLO  (ARMZ) is  still good law and thus, reiterated his earlier prayer that the appeal be allowed and what transpired before the Board and the Tribunal be annulled.

Having carefully considered the record before us and the submissions of  the  learned  counsel,  the  issue  for  our  determination  is  whether  the Board was  clothed with jurisdiction to entertain and determine the respondent's  appeal  against  the  appellants  notice  on  existence  of  tax liability. At  the  outset,  it  is  crucial  to  point  out  that,  the  subject  under scrutiny was  before the amendment of the TRAA and we shall  rely on the law as it was by then.

We  have  no  qualms  that  the  Tanzania Revenue  Authority,  is  a creature of the TRA Act. This is among the statutes which create a right of

appeal  to  the  Board  because  the  provisions  of section  6  of the  TRA Act stipulates as follows:

"Any person  who  is aggrieved by the  decision  of the Commissioner-General in relation to any act or omission  in  the  course  of the  discharge  of any function conferred upon him under the law set out in  the  First Schedule  to  this Act, may appeal to the  Board in  accordance  with  the provisions of  the Tax Revenue Appeals Act . "

## [Emphasis supplied]

Although,  the  cited provision creates  a right of  appeal to a person aggrieved by  the  decision of  the Commissioner  General,  the bolded expression directs such appeal to be made  in accordance  with the provisions  of  the  TRAA  which  entails  the  modality  of  resolution  of  tax disputes  and  regulates  the  processes  and  procedures  on  appeals  to  the Board.  In  the  premises,  section  6  of the  TRA  Act  should  not  be  read  in isolation and instead, together with the TRAA which continues to stand out as  a  major  statute  regulating  the  resolution  of tax  related  disputes.  This takes us to Part IV of the TRAA as  it was in  2010 whereby section  16 (1) and (2) stipulated as follows:

- '16 (1) Any person  who is aggrieved by the final determination by the Commissioner Genera! of  the  assessment  of  tax  or  a  decisions referred to under section 14 of this Act may appeal to the Board.
- (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of  subsection (1), an appeal  shall not H e  in respect  of: -
- (a) a determination made by the Commissioner Generai in accordance with section 13 (1) (a);
- (b) a determination made by the Commissioner General in accordance with section 13 (5) (a); or
- (c) a determination made by the Commissioner Genera! in accordance  with section  13 (5) (b)  to  the  extent  that  the  submission  is made by the objector.

It  is  glaring  that,  the  cross  referencing  in  section  16  (1)  shows that the subsection  was  not  a  stand-alone  because  sub  section  (2),  subjected the  prescribed right  of  appeal  to  the provisions  of  section 13  which mandated Commissioner General to receive and determine objections filed by tax  payers  disputing  tax liability.  Moreover, in terms  of section 16 of  the TRAA,  it is  significantly  discernible that an appeal to the Board  is narrowed

down  to  an  objection  decision  made  by  the  Commissioner  General.  This can be discerned from the nature of documents which must accompany the appeal  as  enumerated  under  Rule  7  of the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board Rules,2001 (the Rules) which among other things, stipulate as follows:

- "7. -(1) A person who institutes an appeal to the Board shaii  attach aii material  documents which are necessary  including  appealable  decision, for  the proper determination of  the appeal.
- (2)  Without prejudice to sub-rule (1),  the appeal shall contain the following documents-
- (a) where the appeal is against objection decision of  the Commissioner GeneraI-
- (i)  a copy of  a notice of  assessment of  tax;
- (ii) a copy  of  notice of  objection to an assessment submitted to Commissioner General by the appellant;
- (iii) a copy  of  the  final  objection decision  of assessment of tax or any other decision by the  Commissioner  General  being  appealed against;
- (iv) a copy  of  a notice issued  by the Commissioner Genera! regarding the

existence of liability to pay tax,  duty,  fees, levy or charge;

- (v) a copy of the notice of  proposal on how the Commissioner wants to settle the objection (if  any);
- (vi) a copy of submission made by taxpayer in response to the notice of  appeal, (if  any);
- (b) where  the  appeal  relates  to refusal  by  the Commissioner Genera!  to admit  a notice of objection, a copy of  the decision of the Commissioner Genera!  to admit  a notice of objection;
- (c) where the appeal relates to­
- ft) refund,  drawback or repayment of any tax, fee, duty,  levy or  charge, a statement showing the calculation by the appellant of the  amount  due  for  refund,  drawback  or repayment  of any  tax,  fee,  duty,  levy  or charge;
- (ii) refusal  by  the  Commissioner  General  to make any refund or repayment;  a  copy of the  decision  of the  Commissioner  General refusing to refund".

Drawing inspiration from the cited rule listing documents accompanying  the  appeal  to  the  Board,  it  is  clear  that  the  notice  on

existence  of  tax  liability  by  the  Commissioner  General  is  certainly  not among  the  decision  envisaged  to  be  appealable  to  the  Board.  In  our considered view, the exclusion was deliberate so as to enable the tax payer before invoking the remedy of an appeal, to exhaust the available remedy of lodging an objection to the Commissioner General or forward the matter to  the  Board by  way  of  reference.  Therefore, in the  absence  of  an objection decision of the Commissioner General,  no appeal could  lie to the Board. This takes us to considering the respondent's claim that the appeal was lodged under the provisions of section 14 (1) and (2) of the TRAA. We shall  examine the  provision  in  order to ascertain  if it creates a  remedy of appeal  against  the  notice  on  existence  of  tax  liability.  It  stipulated  as follows:

## "14 (1) Any  person aggrieved  by-

- fa) the calculation by the Commissioner-General of the amount due for refund,  drawback or repayment of  any tax, duty, levy or charge;
- (b) a  refusal  by  the  Commissioner-General  to make any refund or repayment; or
- (c) an apportionment of any amount or sum by the Commissioner-General under the Second Schedule  to  the  Income Tax  Act which

affects,  or may affect,  the liability to tax of two or more persons; or

- (d) a determination by the CommissionerGeneral under  paragraph 32(4) of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax  Act;
- (e) the decision by the Commissioner-General to register, or refusal to register, any trader for the purpose of  the Value Added Tax  Act,

may appeal therefrom to the Board.

- (2)  Notwithstanding subsection  (2),  a person  who objects a notice issued  by the CommissionerGeneral with regards to the existence of liability to pay any tax, duty, fees, levy or charge may  refer his objection to the Board for determination.

In  the  light  of  the  bolded  expressions,  the  investment  income  tax which is a subject at hand, fell squarely under the category of existence of liability to  pay any tax. The question to be answered  is whether section  14 of the TRAA clothed the Board with jurisdiction to entertain and determine appeals against notice on existence of tax of tax  liability.  In  its  reasoning from  page 209 of the record of appeal, the Tribunal was satisfied that the wording of the appellant's notice at the bottom  part of page 2 established

that  it  was  both  a  decision  as well  as  an  act  by the  appellant which  was appealable to the Board under section 6 of the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act and 14(2) of the TRAA. It held further that, the import of the provisions was  to  enable  any  taxpayer  who  is  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  the appellant to file an appeal to the  Board  irrespective of whether or not the decision or act constituted an  assessment.  With  respect,  we do  not agree with  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  and  we  shall  give  our  reasons  in  due course.

The appellant  is faulting  the Tribunal's  decisions  while  on  the  other hand,  it  was  Mr.  Kileo's  contention  that  the  respondent  had  to  file  an appeal  because  the  law  does  not  prescribe  any  procedure  of  filing  a reference.  As earlier  pointed  out,  section  6  of the  TRA Act  must  be  read together  with  the  provisions  of  sections  12,  13,  14  and  16  of the  TRAA which  by  then  clothed  the  Board  with  jurisdiction  to  entertain  appeals arising  from  objection  decisions  of the  Commissioner  General.  That  said, the  Court  had  the  occasion  to  consider  the  mandate  of  the  Board  as articulated  under the provisions of section  14 (2) of the TRAA in the case of COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  TRA  VS  JSC  ATOMREDMETZOLO (supra) and it stated as follows:

"... subsection (1) limits the circumstances in which one may seek redress by way of an appeal to the TRAB  against  the  decision  of the  Commissioner. Under subsection (2), a person who objects a notice issued by the Commissioner General with regards to the existence of  liability to pay tax,  duty, fees,  levy or charge may refer his objection to the Board for determination.  Thus,  the  remedy on  the  objected notice before the Board is by way of reference and not an appeal as suggested by Dr. Mwiburi. "

In the present matter, it is settled that the appellant's letter found at page  12 of the record of appeal  constituted  notice on  existence of liability to  pay  tax  amounting  to  USD  21,336,931  on  investment  income  that accrued on the sale of interest in  land on  Nyanzaga  project located  in the United Republic.

At this juncture, it is worthy  to restate the obvious  that  the jurisdiction  of  courts  or  tribunals  is  a  creature  of  statute.  Therefore,  the question  of jurisdiction  is  so  fundamental  and  as  a  matter  of  practice,  at the commencement of the trial, the courts or tribunals  must be certain of their jurisdictional position, determine whether  vested with requisite jurisdiction because it goes to the very root of the authority. This has been

emphasized  by the  Court  in  a  number  of decisions  including; RICHARD JULIUS RUKAMBURA VS ISSACK NTWA MWAKAJILA AND ANOTHER, Civil Application No. 3 of 2004, TANZANIA  REVENUE AUTHORITY  VS.  TANGO  TRANSPORT  COMPANY  LTD, Civil  Appeal No.  84 of 2009, FANUEL MANTIRI NG'UNDA VS HERMAN  MANTIRI NG'UNDA AND 20 OTHERS, Civil  Appeal  No.  8 of 1995  (all  unreported) and COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  TRA  VS  JSC  ATOMREDMETZOLO (supra). In the latter case,  relying on the former decisions the Court held:

"What  was  said in  the  above  decisions...  applies with equal force to an appellate Board and Tribunal considering that, before an appeal is determined on the merits on issues not touching on the  jurisdiction (s)  of the court (s) below,  it must be certain  that the  proceedings  giving  rise  to  the  appeal  were competently before that court or those courts.  This is because a judgment In an appeal from proceedings which were a nullity is also a nullity."

In the light of the cited decisions, another question to  be addressed is  what  was  the  remedy  available  to  the  respondent?  It  is  glaring  that, section  14  (2)  of the TRAA vest with the  Board jurisdiction  to  entertain  a reference on objection of a  notice on existence of liability to pay tax issued

by  the  Commissioner  General.  Nowhere  is  it  stated  that,  such  mandate becomes  inoperative  merely  because  of  the  absence  of  the requisite procedure as  suggested  by  Mr.  Kileo.  Besides and  as  earlier  pointed  out, the  remedy  of  an  appeal  to  the  Board,  does  not  extend  to  appealing against the Commissioner General's notices on the existence of tax liability. On this account, we subscribe to what the two learned authors observed in their  book  titled: Introduction  to  Interpretation  of Statutes, Avtar Singh  and  Harpreet  Kaur,  4t h   Edition  at  page  23  as  follows:  The  learned Authors observed as follows:

"When the language of  a statute is plain,  words are dear and unambiguous and give only one meaning, then  effect should be given  to  that plain  meaning only and one should not go in for construction  of the statute....  Courts should not be overzealous in searching  for  ambiguities  or  obscurities  in  words which are plain."

From  the  above  excerpt,  it  is  glaring  that  where  the  language  is clear, the intention of the  Legislature is to be gathered from the  language used and attention should  be paid to what has been said as also to what has not been  said. Therefore, the courts should  not busy themselves with supposed  intention  or  with  the  policy  underlying  the  statute.  Thus,  with

respect, the Tribunal faulted and went beyond what is not prescribed under the  law  to  hold  that  the  notice  on  existence  of  liability  to  pay  tax  was appealable to the Board  under the  provisions of sections 6 of the TRA Act and 14 (2) of the TRAA.

In the circumstances, we agree with Mr.  Maswanyia that our decision in the case of COMMISSIONER GENERAL TRA VS JSC ATOMREDMETZOLO (supra),  remains to  be good  law to the effect that, the objection on existence of tax liability is not appealable to Board. In the event  the  respondent  ought  to  have  approached  the  Board  by  way  of reference  as  stated  under  the  provisions  of  section  14  (2)  of the  TRAA. Thus,  it was  irregular for the respondent to  lodge an  appeal to the  Board against the  notice on  existence of tax liability. Thus,  as the  Board  had  no jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  appeal  against the  existence  of tax  liability,  it embarked on a nullity and its proceedings and judgment cannot be spared. A similar fate  befalls the  proceedings and judgment of the Tribunal  which arose from a nullity.

On  the  way  forward,  we  nullify  the  proceedings  of  both  the  Board and  the  Tribunal,  quash  and  set  aside  the  respective  judgments  and subsequent orders. Thus, the 2n d  ground  is merited, the appeal  is allowed

with  costs.  Since  this  ground  suffices to  dispose  the  appeal  we  shall  not determine the remaining grounds considering that all what transpired stem on  null  proceedings.  If  the  respondent  so  desires,  can  pursue  remedy available in compliance with the law and not otherwise.
