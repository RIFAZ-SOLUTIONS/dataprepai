## RULING OF THE COURT

1s t  &amp; 10t h   June, 2021

## NDIKA. 3.A.:

On  15t h   August,  2017,  a   single  Justice  of the  Court  (Mwambegele, J.A.)  dismissed  the  applicant's  quest vide  Civil  Application  No.  449/16  of 2016 for extension of time to lodge a  memorandum and  record of appeal so  as  to  institute  an  appeal  from  the  judgment  and  decree  of  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal sitting at Dar es Salaam (hereafter  "the Tribunal") dated  8t h   October,  2010  in Tax Appeal  No.  12 of 2010.  By this reference  made  under  Rule  62  (1)  (b)  of  the  Tanzania  Court  of  Appeal Rules, 2009 ("the Rules"), the applicant seeks the reversal of that decision.

Before determining the merits or otherwise of this reference, it is vital that the essential facts of the matter be narrated. These were summarized by the learned single Justice in his ruling based on the affidavit supporting the applicant's notice of motion as follows: the applicant lost its appeal to the Tribunal in Tax Appeal  No.  12 of 2010 against the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (henceforth "the Board"). Aggrieved, the applicant instituted an appeal to this Court. While the said appeal was pending, this Court  ruled  in Midcom  Tanzania  Limited v.  Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No.  1 1  of 2011 (unreported), that pursuant to Rule 21 of the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Rules,  2001,  as  amended,  the  proceedings, decisions  and  drawn  orders of the Tribunal  would  only  be valid  if signed and  certified  by  the  Chairman  or  Vice  chairman  and  all  members  who presided over the matter. As  the applicant's appeal suffered these deficiencies,  meaning  that  it would  ultimately  be  found  incompetent,  the applicant had the appeal marked withdrawn on 28t h  May, 2015.

The applicant then refreshed her quest for appealing by applying for duly signed  and certified  papers from the Tribunal as well as seeking and obtaining extension of time to lodge a fresh  notice of appeal. Accordingly, she lodged a new notice of appeal on 25t h  April, 2016. While waiting to be supplied  with  properly signed and  certified decrees  by the  Board  and  the 2

Tribunal,  the  Court handed  down  yet another ruling  in G.S Contractors Limited v.  Commissioner General (TRA), Civil  Appeal  No.  80 of 2015 (henceforth "G.S Contractors I"), which affected the applicant's endeavours.  In  that  case,  the  Court  ruled  that  an  appeal  to  it from  the Tribunal was a third appeal and thus it required a certificate on a point or points of law  by the Tribunal. To comply with this decision, the applicant sought  and  obtained  a  certificate  from  the  Tribunal  on  31s t   May,  2016. However, G.S Contractors I was varied upon review in G.S Contractors Limited v.  Commissioner General (TRA), Civil  Application  No.  155 of 2016  (henceforth  " G.S Contractors II") as the Court held that appeals from  the  Tribunal  are  not  third  appeals  but  second  appeals  lying  to  the Court  without  any  certificate  on  a  point  or  points  of  law  as  a  condition precedent.

It was further averred that, following a ruling delivered by the Court on 16t h September,  2016  vide African  Barrick  Gold  Mine  PLC  v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 77 of 2016 (unreported), the applicant also discovered that an  omission to  include  in the  record  of appeal documents enumerated under Rule 96 of the Rules would make the record  incomplete,  rendering  the appeal  incompetent.  This compelled the applicant,  again,  to  apply for certified  opinions  of  individual  members  of 3

the  Board  and Tribunal  as well  as certified  copies of exhibits tendered  at the  Board.  The  applicant  was  supplied  with  a  copy  of  the  decree  duly signed  by  members  of the  Board  on  22n d   March  2017  and  with  certified exhibits on  27t h   March,  2017.  Although  at that  point the  applicant  had  a complete set of the required documents for appealing, she was already out of time, hence the application before the learned single Justice of the Court for extension of time to institute the intended appeal.

It was  submitted  for the applicant before the  learned  single Justice that  the  application  disclosed  good  cause  for  the  Court  to  exercise  its discretion  to  grant the  extension  sought.  It was  contended  that that the initial appeal that the applicant was compelled to withdraw was lodged well within  the  prescribed  time  and  that all  along  the  applicant was diligently pursuing the matter to make the intended appeal meaningful in compliance with the decisions of the Court. The applicant relied on Amani Centre for Street Children v.  Viso Construction  Company  Ltd, Civil  Application No.  105  of 2013  (unreported)  for  the  proposition  that extension  of time under  Rule  10 of the  Rules involves the Court's exercise of its discretion, which  must be exercised judiciously in view of the particular circumstances of  the matter. Further  reliance  was  placed  on Insignia  Limited  v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Application No. 2 of 2007 4

(unreported);  and Fortunatus  Masha  v.  William  Shija  &amp;  another [1997] TLR 155.

Although  the  respondent  unreservedly  conceded  to  the  application, the  learned single Justice stated at page 6 of the typed ruling that he still had  to  investigate  and  determine  if,  indeed,  the  application  had  met the threshold  requirement  for  condonation  of the  delay  involved.  Therefore, the  sticking issue  before  the  learned  single  Justice  was  whether  the application disclosed good  cause  for  extending time  to institute the intended appeal.

In determining  the  above  issue,  the  learned  single  Justice  was cognizant that the applicant had duly lodged her initial appeal, which, then she had withdrawn and that she afterwards took proper steps and actions so as to file a proper appeal in compliance with the decisions of the Court. Nonetheless, he took the view that the applicant had failed to account for a period of thirty days reckoned after she was supplied with all the certified documents.  For clarity,  we extract the relevant part of the typed  ruling at pages 9 and 10:

"There  is sufficient explanation  of delay from  the moment the former appeal was withdrawn up to the moment when the certified exhibits were supplied

to her on 27.03.2017. However, the period between the time the certified exhibits tendered at the tr/'ai were avaiied to the applicant  on 27.03.2017  and the time  when  the present application  was lodged on 27.04.2017,  has,  in  my considered  view,  not only been  insufficiently explained but not explained at ail. At  para  17  of  the  affidavit  supporting  the application the applicant deposes through her principal officer that she was supplied with certified copies of  exhibits tendered at the trial on 27.03.2017  and  that  at  that  moment  she  was already out of time hence the present application. Nothing is mentioned why the present application was  filed  one  month  thereafter;  on  27.04.2017, thirty  dear  days  after  the  endeavours  to  comply with the decisions of  the Court were accomplished."

Referring to a number of the decisions of the Court including Bushiri Hassan  v.  Latifa  Lukio  Mashayo, Civil Application No. 3  of  2007 (unreported) on the imperious requirement in an application for extension of  time  for  each  day  of  delay  to  be  accounted  for,  the  learned  single Justice dismissed the application for the applicant's failure to account for a period of one month after she was supplied with all required documents for the intended appeal.

At the hearing  before us,  Mr. Thompson  Luhanga,  learned advocate, who was assisted by Mr. Gerald Sanga, also learned advocate, highlighted the  written  submissions  filed  in  support  of the  application,  urging  us  to reverse the learned single Justice's refusal of extension of time. In the first limb of his submissions,  Mr.  Luhanga  censured  the  learned  single Justice for  proceeding  to  investigate  and  refuse  the  application  while the  matter was  non-contentious  following  the  respondent's  concession to it. He contended that the learned single Justice raised the issue for determination suo motu and  proceeded  to determine  it without affording  the  parties an opportunity to clarify on  the  issue,  which  was,  therefore,  a  breach of the principles of natural justice.

In  the  second  limb  of  his  submissions,  Mr.  Luhanga  assailed  the learned single Justice's holding that the applicant failed to account for each day of delay. Here his argument was two-fold: first, he argued that the rule for accounting for each day of delay only applied under the previous Rule 8 of the Court of Appeal Rules,  1979 (henceforth "the previous Rules") which pegged  extension of time  upon "sufficient cause" being  shown.  He added that  while  the  decisions  of the  Court  interpreting  Rule  8  of the  previous Rules required an applicant to account for each day of the delay involved, Rule 10 of the Rules only requires the existence of a good cause to warrant 7

enlargement of time. Secondly, the learned counsel stoutly contended that the applicant could not file the application for extension of time immediately after being supplied with all the requested documents because she had to prepare and draft an application that had:

"to  include all factual background culminating into the  application  for extension  of time,  preparation and  photocopying of  necessary documents in support  of the  application  for  extension  of time, signing  and attestation , as  well as  time  spent in complying with the  processes  of  Wing of  the application."

On  being  probed  by  the  Court  if the  supporting  affidavit  explained the thirty days delay canvassed by the learned single Justice,  Mr.  Luhanga owned up that no explanation was given.  However,  he hastened to stress that it was during the said period that the applicant drew up and filed the application that was before the learned single Justice. In the premises,  he urged  us  to  hold,  in  the  circumstances  of the  matter,  that the  applicant acted  with  promptitude  to  apply  for  extension  of  time.  To  buttress  his point, the  learned  counsel  referred  us to Eliakim Swai and Another v. Thobias  Karawa  Shoo, Civil  Application No.  2  of  2016  (unreported) where Mwambegele, J.A., again sitting as a single Justice of the Court, held

that the two applicants in that matter, who lodged their application after an interlude of two weeks, "acted within the ambits of requisite promptness" lodging their application.

Mr.  Luhanga  also  relied  on G.A.B.  Swale  v.  Tanzania  Zambia Railway  Authority, Civil Reference No. 5 of  2011 (unreported), a decision  of  the  Court  restating  the  principles  upon  which  a  decision  of single Justice can be examined in a  reference. In the light of this decision, he  argued that the learned single Justice's decision was  based  on misapprehension and  improper appreciation of the facts of the case;  that he  failed  to  take  into  account  that the  application  for  extension  of time could  not  be  lodged  within  a  day  after  all  the  documents  had  been received; that he misapprehended  and  failed  to  appreciate  that  the applicant  had  a  right to  a  hearing  on  the  points  raised  by the  Court suo motif, and that the thirty-days intervening period was not inordinate.

For the respondent,  Mr.  Noah Tito,  learned  State Attorney,  adopted the written submissions filed  in opposition to the reference and  made two points:  First,  he  argued  that  the  Court  had  jurisdiction  to  ascertain  the facts and reasons adduced in support of an application so as to exercise its discretion judiciously and that the  respondent's concession was  not a  bar

to  the  Court's  due  consideration  of  the  matter.  Secondly,  the  learned counsel  contended  that  the  learned  single  Justice  rightly  dismissed  the application for the applicant's failure to account for each of the thirty days of delay from 27t h  March, 2017.

We  have  examined  the  material  on  record  and  given  a  careful consideration to the written and oral submissions of the learned counsel for the  parties on whether good cause was given  in terms of Rule  10 of the Rules  to  warrant  the  enlargement  of  time  sought. It is settled  that extension of time is a matter of discretion on the part of the Court and that such discretion must be exercised judiciously and flexibly with regard to the relevant facts of the particular case. Admittedly, it has not been possible to lay down an invariable definition of good cause so as to guide the exercise of the Court's discretion. Nevertheless, the Court has consistently looked at a  number of factors such  as the  reasons for the delay,  the  length of the delay,  whether the  applicant was diligent,  the degree of prejudice to the respondent  if time  is  extended:  see,  for  instance, Dar es  Salaam  City Council  v.  Jayantilal  P.  Rajani, Civil  Application  No.  27  of  1987;  and Tanga  Cement  Company  Limited  v.  Jumanne  D.  Masangwa  and Amos A. Mwalwanda, Civil Application No. 6 of 2001 (both unreported).

Bearing  in  mind that the grant of extension of time  is discretionary, this  Court would  normally  refrain  from  interfering  with  the  exercise  by  a single Justice of the Court of his discretion  under Rule  10 of the Rules.  In Amada  Batenga  v.  Francis  Kataya, Civil Reference  No. 1 of  2006 (unreported), the Court, having revisited its previous decisions on reference,  summarized  the  principles  upon  which  a  decision  of  a  single Justice can  be examined in a  reference under Rule 62 (1) (b) of the Rules as follows:

- "a)  On  a  reference , the  full  Court  looks  at  the  facts  and submissions the basis of which  the single Judge  made  the decision.
- b)  No  new  facts  or  evidence  can  be  given  by  any party without  prior  leave of  the Court; and
- c) the  single  Judge's  discretion  is  wide, unfettered  and flexible; it can only  be interfered with if there is a misinterpretation of  the law."

In a subsequent decision in G.A.B. Swale {supra), cited to us by Mr. Luhanga, the Court restated the applicable principles thus:

- Y I)  Only  those  issues  which  were  raised  and  considered before the single Justice may be raised in a reference.  (See

## GEM AND ROCK VENTURES CO. LTD VS YONA HAMIS MVUTAH, Civil  Reference No. 1  o f2001 (unreported).

And if  the decision involves the exercise of  judicial discretion:

- (ii)  I f the  single  Justice  has  taken  into  account irrelevant factors or;
- (iii)  I f  the  single  Justice  has  failed  to  take  into  account relevant  matters or;

(iv) If there is misapprehension or improper appreciation of the law or facts applicable to that  issue or;

(v) If, looked at in relation to the available evidence and law, the decision is plainly wrong,  (see KENYA  CANNERS LTD VS TITUS MURIRIDOCTS (1996) LLR 5434, a decision of the Court of  Appeal of  Kenya,  which we find  persuasive) (see also MBOGO AND ANOTHER VSHAH [1968] EA 93"

We wish to stress the above position  by excerpting  a  passage from Mbogo and Another v. Shah [1968] EA 93, at page 94, a decision of the erstwhile  Court of Appeal  for  East  Africa  which  was  cited  and  applied  in numerous decisions including G.A.B. Swafe ( supra)'.

7 think it is  well settled that  this  Court  will not interfere  with  the  exercise  of its discretion  by an inferior court unless it is satisfied that the decision is clearly wrong,  because it has misdirected

## itself or because it has acted on matters on which it shouid not have acted or because it has failed to take into consideration matters which it shouid have taken into consideration and in doing so arrived at a wrong decision , "

[Emphasis added]

Without  doubt,  the  above  stance  is  equally  applicable  to  the  exercise  of discretion by a single Justice of this Court.

What we  are  enjoined  to  determine  in  this  matter  are  two  issues: first, whether the learned single justice raised  issues suo motu in a  noncontentious matter and proceeded to determine them without affording the parties  an  opportunity  to  clarify  on  the  matters  so  raised. Secondly, whether the learned single Justice's refusal of extension for the applicant's failure to account for the delay of thirty days was justified.

We begin with the first issue. Having scanned the material before the learned  single Justice as well  as the  impugned  ruling,  we agree with  Mr. Tito that there  is  utterly  no  basis for faulting  the  approach  taken  by the learned  Justice.  Although  the  respondent  unreservedly  conceded  to  the application,  the learned single Justice stated at page 6 of the typed ruling, rightly  so  in  our  view,  that  he  still  had  to  investigate  and  determine  if,

indeed, the application had met the threshold requirement for condonation of the delay involved. For clarity, we wish to let the record speak for itself:

"The respondent's concession notwithstanding,  the Court is stiii enjoined to investigate if the applicant has advanced good cause to warrant it exercise the discretion to eniarge time as  prayed  by the applicant That is to say, the respondent's concession in no way exonerates the applicant from showing existence of  good cause for the delay so as to enable the Court exercise its discretion to grant the extension sought"

With respect, we go along with Mr. Tito's submission that the learned single Justice had jurisdiction to ascertain the facts as well as the reasons adduced  in  support  of  an  application  so  as  to  exercise  his  discretion judiciously. The mere fact that the respondent conceded to the application did not waive the learned single Justice's power as well as duty to ascertain the merits or otherwise of the application and come to his own conclusion as to whether the application had disclosed good cause.

We have also examined the complaint that in his consideration of the matter,  the  learned  single  Justice  brought  up  new  matters  on  which  he decided  the  application  without  affording  the  parties  a hearing.  With

respect to Mr.  Luhanga, this complaint flies in the face of the record. It is evident from  page 6 through  page  13 of the typed  ruling that the learned single Justice determined the sole issue whether there was good cause for the  delay  involved,  focusing  his  attention  to the  period  of thirty days  of delay  that  occurred  after  the  applicant  had  obtained  all  the  certified documents on 27t h  March, 2017. This was plainly not a new issue raised by the learned single suo motu but one borne out of the material before him.

In resolving the issue before him, the learned single Justice considered nothing else but the supporting affidavit and the submissions of the counsel.  He paid special attention to the averment in paragraph  17 of the  supporting  affidavit that  by  27t h   March,  2017 the applicant  had  been supplied with all the required documents but that there was no explanation as to why the application  before him was filed a  month  later. Accordingly, we answer the first issue in the negative.

We now turn to the issue whether the learned single Justice's refusal of extension  for  the  applicant's  failure  to  account  for the  delay  of thirty days was justified.

As  indicated  earlier,  Mr.  Luhanga,  at forefront,  submitted that while the  decisions  of  the  Court  interpreting Rule  8  of  the  previous  Rules

required  an applicant to account for each  day of the delay involved,  Rule 10  of  the  Rules  only  requires  the  existence  of  good  cause  to  warrant enlargement  of  time. We  think  Mr. Luhanga's  view  is based on  a misconception that there is world of difference between the requirement of "sufficient  cause"  under  Rule  8  of  the  previous  Rules  and  the  current threshold of "good cause" under Rule  10 of the Rules. In Mexon Energy Limited  v.  Mogas  Tanzania  Limited, Civil  Application  No.  264/16  of 2017 (unreported), a single Justice of the Court observed, rightly so in our view, that there is a thin line of distinction between the two concepts which is  that  "good  cause"  is  milder  in  its  proof  than  "sufficient  cause."  The learned  single  Justice  relied  on Arjun  Singh  v.  Mohindra  Kumar and Others [1964] 5 SCR 946;  [1964] AIR 993 in which the Supreme Court of India held:

' . . . we do not see any materia1  difference between the  facts  to  be  established for satisfying  the  two tests of \good cause'  and 1 sufficient cause.' We are unabie  to  conceive of a  'good cause ' which is not 'sufficient'  as  affording  an  explanation  for  nonappearance,  nor conversely of a  'sufficient cause' which  is not a good one and we  would add that either  of  these  is  not  different  from \good  and sufficient  cause' which  is  used in  this  context in

other statutes.  If,  on  the other hand,  there is any difference between the two it can only be that the requirement of  a \good cause"  is complied with on a lesser  degree of  proof  than that  of  'sufficient cause.

[At https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608703/ accessed on 06.06.2018]

With  respect,  we think that despite the  phrase "good  cause" under Rule  10 of the  Rules  requiring  a  lesser degree of proof it is too  plain for argument that an  applicant  for  enlargement of time  under the  aforesaid rule  must account for each  day of the  delay  involved  so  as to  allow the Court to determine the degree of the delay involved, the party's diligence i n   the  pursuit of the  matter,  the soundness of the reason for the delay as well as whether the applicant acted expeditiously. Admittedly, the learned single  Justice  relied  on Bushiri  Hassan {supra) as  his  authority for the delay accounting principle under Rule 8 of the previous Rules, but the said principle has been adopted by  the  Court  in its numerous  decisions interpreting Rule 10 of the Rules, some of which were cited by the learned single Justice in his ruling: Mgombaeka Investment Company Limited &amp; Two  Others  v.  DCB  Commercial  Bank  PLC, Civil  Application  No. 500/16  of  2016, Vodacom  Foundation  v.  Commissioner  General

(TRA), Civil Application No. 300/17 of 2016 and Mwita Mataluma Ibaso v.  Republic, Criminal Application No. 6 of 2013 (all  unreported). See also Bariki  Israel  v. Republic, Criminal  Application No. 4  of  2011; and Sebastian Ndaula v. Grace Rwamafa (Legal Personal Representative of Joshwa  Rwamafa), Civil  Application  No.  4 of 2014 (both unreported).

As  to whether  the learned single Justice properly refused the extension  of time  sought,  we  are  satisfied  that  he  rightly  held  that  the applicant had the onus to account for each  day of the delay involved  but that she failed to account for the delay of thirty days from 27t h  March, 2017 as the  supporting  affidavit was silent on  that aspect.  It is significant that Mr. Luhanga  admitted  that  the  delay  was  not  explained  away  in  the supporting affidavit. The explanation that he gave us in his written and oral submissions,  that  the  applicant  spent  the  thirty  days  period  preparing, drawing up and filing the application for extension of time, is nothing but a statement from the bar that cannot be acted upon.  Nor could it have been acted  upon by  the  learned  single  Justice had  it been made  in  the applicant's submissions  before him.  At this  point,  we are of the firm view that  the  learned  single  Justice  neither  misapprehended  the  facts  of the case  nor  did  he  fail  to  take  into  account  a  relevant  consideration.  In 18

consequence, we uphold his finding that no good cause had been shown to warrant him to exercise his discretion in the applicant's favour.

In  the  final  analysis,  we  find  no  basis  to  interfere  with  the  learned single Justice's exercise  of discretion  in  the  matter.  The  reference  stands dismissed with costs.
