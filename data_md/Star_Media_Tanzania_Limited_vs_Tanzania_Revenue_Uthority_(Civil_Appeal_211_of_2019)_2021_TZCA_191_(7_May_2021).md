## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

21st  April &amp; 7th  May, 2021

## KITUSI, 3.A.:

This  appeal  arises  from  the  decisions  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Board (The  Board)  and  the  Revenue Tax Appeals Tribunal  (The Tribunal),  the Board  dismissing  the  appellant's  application  for  extension  of  time  and the Tribunal  dismissing  the  subsequent appeal  that sought to challenge the  Board's  decision.  The  undisputed  facts  forming  the  background  of this matter as correctly summarized by the Tribunal are as follows:  -

On  31 March  2017  the  respondent  in  exercise  of  its  statutory powers  served  the  appellant  with  tax  assessments  for  the  years  of

income  2013,  2014  and  2015  raising  a  demand  for  a  total  of  TZS 8.443.993.166.00.  The  appellant  objected  to  the  assessment  and  the objection was  admitted by the respondent  after payment  of  TZS 150.000.000.00 by the appellant.

We are, at the moment,  skipping some details which we will  bring forth  at  an  appropriate  time  later.  On  6th   June  2017  the  respondent informed the appellant in writing that it had determined the objection by refusing to vary or amend the assessment of TZS 8,443,993,106.00, and that it intended to confirm it. The appellant had a  right of appeal against the  respondent's  decision  and  should  have  lodged  a  notice  of  appeal within  30  days  under  Rule  3  (1)  and  (2)  of the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Board  Rules,  2018  (the  Rules).  However,  for  some  reason,  she  did  not lodge that notice within the time stipulated by law.

On  25th August  2017  the  appellant lodged  at  the Board, an application for extension of time within which to lodge a notice of appeal against the  respondent's  decision.  The  Board  dismissed  the  application and  as  we  have  indicated  earlier,  the  appellant's  first  appeal  to  the Tribunal to challenge the dismissal  bore no fruits.  Hence this appeal.

Prior  to  the  determination  of  the  objection,  the  respondent  had written  to  the  appellant  requiring  her  to  submit  to  it  audited  financial

statements for the years under scrutiny, and to do so within three days. However, the appellant could  not do so within  time on the ground that the  statements were  in  the  office  of the  Controller and  Auditor General (CAG), and she wrote the respondent to disclose that predicament. That was the appellant's main ground  before the  Board  in the application for extension of time

The  respondent  admitted  to  have  received  the  applicant's  said letter but submitted  that the same was received  after the objection  had already  been determined.  It was further submitted that  in  the  notice of confirmation  of the  intended  tax assessment,  the  respondent stipulated the  procedure to  be followed  by the applicant if she intended to dispute it.

At  the  end  of  the  day, the  Board  accepted  the respondent's argument  that  the  applicant  had  not  shown  reasonable  cause  for  the delay as required  by section  16 (5) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap 408, (Cap 408) because at the time the appellant informed the respondent by a letter dated  17th  August, 2017 that the statements were in the CAG's office, the objection had already been determined.

Before  the  Tribunal  on  first  appeal  and  before  us,  the  appellant raised  the  issue  of  illegality.  It was  her  contention  that the  respondent

determined  the  objection  without  affording  her  an  opportunity  to  be heard.  This  is  reflected  in  the first two  grounds of appeal  which  run  as follows: -

- 1. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in taw by holding  that the  appellant  was given  an  opportunity to be  heard  by  the  respondent  before confirming the assessment.
- 2. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law by holding  that  the  issue  o f illegality  does  not arise  after holding  that  the  com plaint  concerning  the  right  to  be heard has no m erit

The third ground of appeal was not pursued. It had sought to fault the Tribunal  on  a  factual  finding  that  the  Board  correctly  relied  on  the appellant's letter to the respondent as being proof of the said appellant's conduct.  We go along with the appellant that this ground of appeal was correctly abandoned  because  it  is factual  and  there  are  two  concurrent findings on it.

Back to the question  of illegality  raised  under the two  grounds of appeal, we have to make it clear right from the beginning, that since the Tribunal  decided  on  that question,  our  duty  is  limited  to  determining  if that decision  should  or should  not stand.  Mr.  Stephen  Axwesso,  learned advocate for the  appellant,  urged  us to  find  fault  in  the  decision  of the Tribunal.  Written  submissions  had  been  filed  well  ahead  of the  date  of hearing,  and  counsel  adopted  them,  preferring  to  elaborate  on  those two grounds of appeal.

Mr.  Axwesso's  arguments  were  on  what  he  insisted  should  have been  done  under  section  52  of the  Tax  Administration  Act,  No.  10  of 2015,  hereafter the Act,  upon admitting  the objection.  He then  pointed out what was actually done in this case.  He submitted that section 52 of the Act requires the respondent,  upon admitting an objection raised by a tax  payer,  to  determine  it.  Specifically,  he  referred  to  section  52  (3)  of the  Act  as  requiring  the  respondent to  respond  to  every  aspect  of the objection,  and  section  52  (4) of the Act as giving the appellant the right to submit on every aspect of it.

Instead of observing that procedure, counsel submitted, the respondent demanded audited financial statements, thereby denying the appellant  the  statutory  right  of  addressing  every  point  as  stipulated under the  law  cited  above.  Mr.  Axwesso  submitted  further,  referring  to the decision  of the Tribunal,  that  it erred  in  observing  that the  issue of illegality  was  not  raised,  while  in  fact  it  was.  Counsel  argued  that  the illegality  was  so patent  that  even  if  it  had not  been  raised  by  the

appellant,  the  Tribunal  ought  to  have  raised  it  on  its  own  motion.  He submitted that in  its determination on the  issue of denial  of the  right to be heard, the Tribunal erred because it did not consider the effect of the clear violation  of the  procedure  stipulated  under  section  52  (3)  (4)  and (5) of the Act.  Counsel  referred to the case of Dishon John  Mtaita v. The  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions, Criminal  Appeal  No. 132  of 2004  (unreported)  and  Article  13  (6)  (a)  of  the  Constitution  of  the United  Republic of Tanzania,  1977 to support his argument that the right to be heard is fundamental and the respondent's violation of that right is fatal.  He proceeded to submit that, that violation constitutes an illegality, which  in  turn  entitles  the  appellant  to  extension  of  time.  On  this,  the learned  counsel  cited  the  cases  of Arunaben  Chaggan  Mistry  v. Naushad Mohamed Hussein and 2 Others, Civil Application  No.  6 of 2016  and; V.I.P  Engineering  and  Marketing  Limited  v.  Citi  Bank Tanzania Limited, Consolidated Civil  Reference No. 6,  7 and 8 of 2006 (both unreported).

On the other hand, the  respondent was opposed to the appeal.  It was  represented  by  Mr.  Harold  Gugami,  learned  Senior  State  Attorney. Like the appellant,  the  respondent  had  filed  written  submissions,  which Mr. Gugami adopted immediately upon taking the floor.

The learned  Senior State Attorney's  initial  argument  was  that the appellant  did  not  need  the  audited  financial  statements  in  lodging  the intended  notice  of  appeal.  Then  he  went  on  to  take  us  through  the procedure that was followed by the respondent and argued that it acted within  the  law.  He  submitted  that  section  52  (1)  of the  Act  empowers the  Commissioner,  when  dealing  with  an  objection, to request  for further evidence. He submitted that the respondent's demand  for submission  of audited  financial  statements  was  meant to  call  from  the appellant,  submission  of  further  evidence  under  that  provision.  When the appellant did not comply  with the respondent's demand, the respondent  issued  a  letter  informing  her  of  its  intention  to  confirm  the assessment. In this letter, the appellant was given 30 days within which to  make  submissions  against  the  intended  confirmation.  When  there were no submissions by the appellant, on  10th  July 2017 the  respondent confirmed the assessment.

Mr.  Gugami submitted that the appellant acted outside the law, so he  cannot  take  advantage  of  illegality.  He  submitted  further  that  the cases  cited  by  Mr.  Axwesso  on  illegality  are  distinguishable to the facts of the present case.

Those are  the  arguments  by  the  parties,  for  us  to  consider.  Our starting  point  is  section  16  of  Cap  408  and  Rule  3  (1)  and  (2)  of  the Rules.  Under the  Rules,  the  period  for  lodging  a  notice  of appeal  is  30 days  from  the  date  of  the  impugned  decision.  The  Board  has  powers under section  16  (5)  of Cap  408  to  extend  the  time  upon  proof  by  the applicant  that  the  delay  was  caused  by  his  absence  from  the  United Republic, or his illness or any other reasonable cause.

There  is  no  dispute  that  illegality  has,  hitherto,  formed  a  ground for  extension  of time  in  its  own  right.  The  question  that  lingers  here  is whether  the  appellant  was  denied  the  right  to  be  heard  as  alleged, because if she was denied that right, then that constitutes an illegality.

Although  the  counsel  for  the  parties  hold  different  views  on  the matter, both  of  them  have  built  their  arguments  around  the  same provisions of section  52 of the Act.  We shall  reproduce that provision  in full so as to easily fathom the essence of the arguments:  -

"(1)  The Commissioner General may,  upon admission o f an  objection  pursuant  to  section  51, make  a decision by determining the objection or call for any evidence  or any  other inform ation  as  may appear necessary  for  the  determination  o f the objection and may, in that respect-

- (a) amend  the  assessment  in accordance with the objection and any further evidence that has been received; or
- (b)  refuse to amend the assessment
- (2) where  the  Commissioner  Genera! agrees  to  amend the assessment in accordance with the objection, he shaii serve a notice o f  the final assessm ent to the objector,
- (3) where the Commissioner Generah
- (a) intends to amend the assessment in accordance with the objection and  any further evidence; or
- (b) decides to refuse to amend the assessment, he  shall  serve  the  objector  with  a  notice setting out the reasons for the intention or decision.
- (4) The  objector  shall, within thirty  days  from the receipt  o f  the  notice  pursuant  to  subsection  (3), make  submission  in writing  to the  Commissioner General on his agreement or disagreement with  the amended assessment or the refusal.
- (5) The Commissioner Generai may, after the receipt o f the  submissions  by  the  objector  made pursuant to subsection (4)-

- (a) determine the objection in the light o f  the amended assessment or refusal and any submission made by the objector; or
- (b) determine the objection partially in accordance with the submission by  the objector.

We have closely  read  the  above  provisions as  well  as the  written communications the respondent made to the appellant. It dawns on  us that the respondent acted within the law and the appellant's insinuation of denial  of a  hearing  is  a  vain  attempt  lacking  legal  support. We shall give our reasons.

First,  we  agree  with  Mr.  Gugami  that  section  52(1)  empowers  the respondent to  request for  more evidence. Acting  under those  powers, the respondent wrote to the appellant on 29/5/2017 requiring submission  by  her  of  duly  signed  audited  financial  statements. On 6/6/2017  the  respondent  wrote  to  the  appellant  a  letter  intimating  an intention  to  confirm  the  assessments  after  the  appellant's  failure  to submit the said statements. Part of the letter reads:

" ! According  to  available  evidence  your  objections  were ' admitted  and, in the  determination  process  it  was realized that duly signed audited financial statem ents for

the period under review were not submitted. It should be noted that application  o f section  40  (3)  o f the  Tax Administration Act, 2015 on jeopardy assessments were effected due to such failure and that financial statements are basic  documents in objection determination.  In  view o f the above,  the  Commissioner General has refused to amend the assessments and you are given thirty (30) days from the receipt o f this notice to make submission in  writing to the undersigned as to whether you agree or disagree on the decision made as per law".

Secondly,  we  hold  the  view  that the  very  request for evidence  in the form of duly signed audited financial statements, was an opportunity for the appellant to be heard by substantiating  her objection.  Even when no  statements  were  submitted,  the  record  shows  that  the  respondent did  not  unilaterally  confirm  the  assessments.  Rather,  it  wrote  to  the appellant and gave her 30 days within which she could make submissions in opposition to the proposed confirmation.

Therefore,  while we agree with the  appellant's  argument that the respondent had  a  legal  duty to determine every aspect of the objection and the appellant had a right to submit on every aspect of the objection, our  conclusion  from  the  available  material  is  that  since  the  appellant

made  no submissions for the respondent to consider,  she cannot blame anyone  for the  self-infticted  injury  that  resulted.  What  we  gather  from the provisions of section  52 of the Act is that the right of a tax payer to be heard is inherent in it, and all the appellant as well as the respondent needed to do was to comply with that provision.

Incidentally,  all  that  is  too much  of  a  digression, in our  view because,  in  principle,  for  a  party  to  successfully  argue  illegality  in  an application  for  extension  of  time,  it  must  be  one  that  is  obvious.  We have said  this  so  many times,  since the  times  of Principal  Secretary Ministry  of  Defence  and  National  Service  v.  Devran  Valambia [1991]  T.L.R  387  and  other  cases  such  as Lyamuya  Construction Company  Limited  v.  The  Board  of  the  Registered  Trustees  of Young Women Christian Assosciation of Tanzania, Civil Application No. 2 of 2010  and Ngao  Godwin Losero  v.  Julius Mwarabu, Civil Application  No.  10 of 2015 (both  unreported). We need not  repeat  ourselves  in  expressing  the  view  that  illegality  should  not involve long drawn arguments for it to qualify as a ground for extension of time. In this case however, that is exactly what happened.

To conclude this  part,  we  agree  with  the Tribunal  that there  was no  illegality,  and  that  in  any event,  not  every time  illegality  is  raised,  it should entitle a  party to  extension  of time.  After all,  the decision  of the Tribunal  was  in  the  exercise  of  its  discretionary  powers  which  is  rarely questioned  by a  superior  court or tribunal.  In  the  case  of Republic v. Donatus Dominic @ Ishengoma and 6 Others, Criminal  Appeal  No. 262 of 2018 (unreported), we cited our earlier decision in Credo Siwale v.  Republic, Criminal  Appeal  No.  417  of  2013  (unreported)  where  we stated:  -

"There  are principles  upon  which  an  appellate  Court can interfere with the exercise o f discretion o f  an inferior court or  tribunal. These general principles  were set out in  the decision  o f  the  East  Court  o f Appeal  in  MBOGO  AND ANOTHER v. SHAH [1968] E.A. 93. And these are:-

- (i) if   the in ferio r court m isdirected itself; or
- (ii)  it  has acted on m atters on  which it should not have acted; or
- (iii) it  has failed to take into consideration m atters which it   should have taken into consideration,

And in so doing, arrived at a wrong conclusion."

None  of  the  three  factors  exist  in  this  case, so  we  have  no justification for interfering with the decision of the Tribunal. Accordingly, we find no merit in this appeal. We dismiss it in its entirety, with costs.
