## RULING

17t h  &amp; 24t h  August, 2021

## KOROSSO, J.A

The applicant, Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company (Formally  Vodacom  Tanzania  Limited),  lodged  the  present  application pursuant  to  Rule  10  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  Rules  ("the  Rules").  The relief sought  is  for  extension  of time  within  which  to  apply  for  revision against  the proceedings  and decision of  the Tax Revenue  Appeal Tribunal  (TRAT)  dated  15t h   December,  2020  in  Application  No.  37  of 2020 on the grounds set out in the Notice of Motion that: -

- (a) From  15t h   December 2020 when the decision  of the Tribunal was pronounced, the applicant was waiting to  be  supplied  with  signed  and  certified  copies  of proceedings,  ruling and drawn order.
- (b) From  8th March,  2021  when  signed  and  certified copies of proceedings,  ruling  and  drawn  order were supplied  upon  the  applicant  until  the  date  of  filing the present  application, the applicant has been drafting  and  preparing  the  present  application  for filing before the Court.
- (c) The  applicant's  delay  in  lodging  revision  is  neither out of negligence nor lack of diligence.

The  application  is  supported  by  the  affidavit  deposed  by  Joseph Waziri, a principal officer  of  the  applicant. On  the  other  hand,  the respondent  filed an affidavit in reply sworn by Gloria Achimpota, contesting the application.

To better appreciate the context  of this application, at this juncture, a brief background of the matter as gathered from the affidavit in support  of  the  application  and  annexures  thereto  is  pertinent.  In 2015,  the  respondent  conducted  an  audit  of  the  tax  affairs  of  the

applicant  for  the  purpose  of  income  tax  for  the  years  of  income  2012 and 2013. When the audit was completed, on 17/12/2015 the respondent issued  a  notice of adjusted  assessment with  the  amount of Tshs.  40,495,380,566.86.  Aggrieved  by the  notice,  the applicant  lodged a notice of  objection whose  determination was  not  in its favour. Dissatisfied  by the decision of the respondent, the applicant appealed to the Tax  Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) in Appeal  No.  184 of 2016. On 4/10/2019 the Board delivered in favour of the respondent. Undaunted,  the applicant appealed to the Tax  Revenue Appeal Tribunal ("the TRAT")  vide Appeal  No.  16  of 2020.  The applicant also  lodged  in the same tribunal an application for leave to adduce additional evidence of  an  expert  witness  on  the  permanency  of  telecommunication  tower which  was admitted as application  No.  37 of 2020. TRAT in  its decision delivered on  15/12/2020 dismissed the application for lack of merit and on  the  same  day  the  applicant  applied  to  be  supplied  with  certified copies of proceedings, ruling and drawn order. The applicant had to wait until  on  8/3/2021  to  be  supplied  with  the  same,  after  having  sent  a couple  of  reminders.  By  the  time  the  applicant  was  supplied  with  the necessary  documents,  the  time  to  apply  for  revision  that  is,  sixty  (60)

days by virtue of Rule 65(4) of the Rules had already expired,  hence the current application.

On  the  day the  application  came  for  hearing  Ms.  Hadija  Kinyaka, learned  advocate  entered  appearance for applicant and  commenced  by adopting the  notice of motion and affidavit in support of the application so  that  they  form  part  of  her  overall  submission.  She  expounded  that the  reasons grounding the application are found  in the  notice of motion and  paragraphs  10-12 of the affidavit.  One,  that on  the same day after the TRAT decision was pronounced on  15/12/2020, the applicant applied to  be  supplied  with  certified  copies  of  proceedings,  ruling  and  drawn order  however,  there  was  some  delay  by  the  TRAT  to  supply  them despite letters of reminder. The applicant was supplied with the same on 8/3/2021.  She argued  that at the  time  the applicant was  provided  with the  necessary documents,  the time to file  revision  had  expired,  and  on 10/3/2021 the applicant applied for certificate of delay and also undertook to prepare the current application, filed on  18/3/2021.

She contended further that as averred in the affidavit in support of the application, the applicant has not been  negligent or lacked diligence in  pursuit of the  preferred  revision  and  that the  delay to  file  it on  time was  occasioned by TRAT  failing to supply  the applicant with the necessary  documents  essential in preparation of the revision. She argued  further that after  being  supplied  with  the  necessary  documents when  the  time  to  prefer  a  revision  or  appeal  had  already  run  out,  she spent some time to write to TRAT seeking for certificate of delay and to prepare  the  current  application.  To  bolster  her  assertions,  she  referred me  to  the  holdings  in  the  cases  of Yusufu  Same  and  Another  vs. Hadija Yusufu Civil Appeal No.l of 2002 (page 7); Patrick Magologozi  Mongella  vs  The  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Public Service  Pensions  Fund Civil  Application  No.  1999/18  of  2018  (pages 10 and  11) and Benedict Mumello vs. Bank of Tanzania Civil Appeal No.  12  of  2002  (pages  7  and  11)  (all  unreported).  In  conclusion,  she implored  me  to  properly  exercise  the  requisite  discretion  and  extend time as prayed.

Responding  to  the  submission,  Mr.  Yohana  Ndila  assisted  by  Ms. Hadja  Senzia, both learned  Senior  State  Attorneys  representing  the respondent,  commenced  his  submission  by  alluding  the  respondent's opposition to the application. Thereafter,  Mr.  Ndila  adopted the affidavit in reply so that it forms part of the oral submission.

Whilst,  Mr.  Ndila found  no reason to challenge the delay within the period where the applicant was waiting for copies of necessary

documents  as  averred,  however,  he  had  qualms  with  the  period  from 8/3/2021  to  18/3/2021  that  is,  the  days  from  when  certified  copies  of the  necessary  documents were  supplied  to  the  time  the  applicant filed the  present application.  The  respondent's misgivings were  based on the ground  that,  as  well  established,  where  there  is  such  a  delay,  the applicant is required to account for each day of delay.  He argued that in the instant matter, the applicant has only provided a general account of delay stating that during the said period she was  going through documents  to  determine  whether  the  way  forward  was  an  appeal  or revision.  The  learned  State  Attorney  contended  that  the  applicant  has failed to account for each day of delay and therefore no good cause has been advanced. To cement his contention,  he cited  the case of Karibu Textile Mills Limited vs. Commissioner General TRA, Civil Application  No.  129/20  of 2016  (unreported).  He  rested  his  submission by urging the Court to dismiss the application for lack of merit.

In rejoinder, the counsel for applicant reiterated the earlier arguments  and  submission  emphasizing  the  fact  that  the  applicant diligently utilized the  time  after being supplied with  the necessary documents  to  initiate  the  process  for  filing  the  current  application.  To reinforce  her  assertion,  she  referred  me  to  the  decision  in  the  case  of

Patrick Magologozi Mongella (supra) where this Court held that,  12 days was sufficient for preparation of the revision. She then urged me to grant  the  application  contending  that  the  applicant  has  given  a  full account of the delay to file the requisite application within time.

Having  heard the  rival  arguments from  both  parties the  remaining task  before  me  to  resolve  is  whether  the  applicant  has  fronted  good cause for the delay to warrant the exercise of my discretion in his favour in  terms  of  Rule  10  of  the  Rules.  For  avoidance  of  doubt,  I  find  it instructive to reproduce the said Rule in full: -

"The  Court  may, upon  good cause  shown, extend the time limited by these Rules or by  any  decision of  the High Court  or tribunal \   for the doing of  any act authorized or required by these Rules,  whether before or after the doing of the act; and any reference in these Rules to any such time shall be construed as a reference to that time as so extended [Emphasis added).

The  above  cited  provision  requires  the  applicant  to  show  good cause for the delay in filing  intended  matter within the time  prescribed. The  Court  has  through  a  number  of  decisions  provided  guidelines  on factors to  consider when  determining what is good  cause  in  such  cases as: Kalunga  &amp;  Company  Advocates  Ltd  vs  National  Bank  of Commerce Ltd [2006] TLR 235 and Attorney General vs Tanzania Ports Authority &amp; Another, Civil Application No. 87 of 2016 (unreported) to mention but a few.

Matters  to  consider  when  exercising  discretion  to  grant extension of time include; the length of delay, the reason for the delay and degree of prejudice that the respondent may suffer if the application is granted. As  stated  hereinabove,  the  duty  is  on  the  applicant  to  provide  the relevant  material  as  stated  in The  Regional  Manager  TANROADS Kagera vs  Ruaha  Concrete Company  limited, Civil  Application  No. 96  of  2007  (unreported).  As  intimated  above,  the  decision  of  TRAT subject of the instant application was  delivered on 15/12/ 2020. Certainly,  the  applicant  was  required  to  file  his  application  within  sixty (60)  days  from  the  date  of  delivery  of  the  decision  in  terms  of  Rule 65(4) of the Rules.

In  the  instant  application  essentially,  the  applicant's  main  reason for the delay centers on delay to  be supplied with the TRAT documents related to Application  No.  37 of 2020,  which despite timely request and reminders,  the  same were supplied to the applicant on  8/3/2021,  when the time to file intended revision had already expired. On the

respondent's side, the days in which the applicant was waiting for copies of  necessary  documents  have  not  been  challenged.  However,  what  is challenged  is the period from the receipt of the necessary documents to when the current application  was  filed,  that  is,  9/3/2021  to  18/3/2021, wanting  the  Court to find  the  said  period  not to  be  properly accounted for.

Having  scrutinized  the  affidavital  evidence  and  the  submissions before  me,  I  agree  with  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  that there is no need to query the days up to the time the applicant received the  certified  copies  of proceedings,  ruling  and  drawn  order  in  line  with the  Court's  decisions  in Patrick  Magologozi  Mongella (supra)  and Benedict Mabalanganya vs Romwald Sanga, Civil Application  No.  1 of 2002 (unreported).

In  essence,  the  days  that  remain  to  be  accounted  for  is  from 9/3/2021  to  18/3/2021  which,  when  scrutinized,  basically,  the  days  to be explained  are  9  days,  that  is  9/3/2021  to  17/3/2021.  Understanding the duty falling  upon the applicant to account for the 9 days delay,  I am of  the  view  that  as  argued  by  the  respondent's  counsel,  the  time  the applicant  used  to  apply for certificate  of delay of which  she  was  issued on  16/3/ 2021  has nothing to do with this application.  Nevertheless,  it is

important  to  remember  the  said  fact  does  not  do  away  with  what  is averred in paragraph  12 of the affidavit supporting the notice of motion. In  that  paragraph  the  applicant  avers  that  from  8/3/2021  upon  being supplied  with  the  certified  copies  of the  necessary  documents  until  the date  of  filing the present  application, the process  of  drafting and preparing the instant application proceeded simultaneously leading to its filing on the  18/3/2021.

From  the  foregoing,  the  underlying  question  is  whether  the  9  or even  10 days for the  sake of argument are  reasonable  to  prepare  such an application and  file. I am  of  the  view  that  the  said days  are reasonable  since  they  were  spent  preparing and  filing the current application.  This  is  in  tandem  with  the  decision  of the  single  justice  in Patrick  Magologozi  Mongella (supra),  where  12  days were found  to be reasonable in preparation and filing of the application for extension of time  upon  receipt  of  the  necessary  documents  in  pursuit  of  intended revision.

Essentially,  for  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  find  the  applicant  has accounted  for  the  delay  which  I  hold  was  not  inordinate.  I  am  also  of the  view  the  respondent  will  not  be  prejudiced  if  this  application  is granted.  In the premise,  I find that there is good cause for granting the

application as prayed and which I hereby do. The application for revision be filed within sixty days from the date of pronouncement of this Ruling. Costs be in the cause.

It is so Ordered.

DATED at DODOMA this 23r d  day of August, 2021.
