## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

22'd )uly, &amp; 5th October,  2020

## LEVIRA, J.A.:

The appellant,  VODACOM  TANZANIA PUBLIC UMITED COMPANY (the WPLC) appeals against the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) in Tax Appeal No. 17 of 2010 delivered on 6th April, 2011. In that decision, the Tribunal reversed the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) in Consolidated  Income Tax Appeals No. 18 and 19 of 2010 where the appellant had successfully appealed

against the respondent's  assessment of income tax in respect of the years of income 2006 and 2007.

For a better understanding  of this matter, a brief background  is to the effect that, the appellant was not satisfied with the amount of tax liability assessed  by the respondent in tax audit conducted on the appellant's tax affairs for the years  of income 2006 and 2007 as introduced  above. Therefore, she filed an objection  to the respondent  against that assessment. Eventually,  after correspondences  between the two, the respondent issued a Notice of amended final assessment to the appellant on 23'd February,  2010. The respondent  disallowed  the appellant's claim of deduction of capital expenditure  at a rate of 100% basing on the Income Tax Act, 1973 and Interest on shareholder's  loan on accrual basis as provided  by the Income Tax Act, 2004.

The appellant maintained her stance that, she was entitled to 100% deduction  of capital expenditures  incurred for the years of income 2006 and 2007 and deduction of interests  on the shareholders'  loan for the year of income 2006 on accrual basis. This stance was contrary to the respondent's contention that interest on shareholders' loan for the year 2006, is to be deducted on payment  basis. The appellant's claim was

premised  on the Ceftificates  of Investment  Incentives issued  on the appellant by the Tanzania  Investment  Centre (TIC) pursuant  to section 17(1) of the Tanzania Investment  Act, Cap 38 R.E 2002 (the TIA) as amended.

The said Certificates  are the following: Ceftificate  No. 110016, No. 110016, No. 1100166-01,  No. 110016-06 and No. 110016-01  issued on 21i February 2000, 15th April 2004, 14th March 2005, 14th March 2006 and 10th March 2008 respectively. Being aggrieved by the amended flnal assessment, the appellant appealed to the Board and on 27th August 2010, the Board delivered  its  judgment  in the appellant's favour. Aggrieved by that decision, the respondent  successfully  appealed to the Tribunal and hence, the current appeal by the appellant challenging  that decision.

In her amended  memorandum of appeal lodged on 16h July, 2020 the appellant has raised seven grounds,  claiming that:-

- 1. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the appellant was not entitled  to 100o/o deduction of the expenditure incurred.
- 2. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in its interpretation  of section 16(2Xw)  of the Income Tax Act, 1973.

- 3. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the appellant was not entitled to the continued entitlement  to utilize the incentives  granted  to them  prior to the coming in force of the income Tax Act, 2004 in respect of ceftificate of incentives No. 110016 issued by the Tanzania Investment Centre on the 21* February 2000.
- 4. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in its interpretation  of section 16(2Xw) of the Income Tax Act, 1973 read together with section 19(2) and (3) of the Tanzania Investment Act, Cap 38 R:E 2002 as amended by the Written Laws (Miscellaneous  Amendments) Act, 2005 (Act No. 5 of 2005).
- 5. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the two ceftificates  of Incentives  Nos. 110016/01 issued on 14th March 2005 and 110016/01 issued on 14h March 2008 by the Tanzania Investment Centre were intended to expand and not to extend the unutilized benefits conferred and granted on the appellant under the Income Tax Act, 1973.
- 6. The Tax Revenue  Appeals Tribunal misdirected  itself in law on the law applicable in considering the deductibility of interest and the attendant mode of allowing the

deduction  that is, whether to apply the accrual  basis or the actual payment basis.

- 7. The Tax Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in law by failing to comply with the mandatory  provision of Rule 1a(5) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal Rules, 2001 (GN No. 57 of 2001) by the tribunal  chairman  failing to record the opinion of one of the members of the Tribunal namely, Mr. W. N. Ndyetabula who dissented in respect of part of the Tribunal's  judgment  and also by failing to record reasons for his disagreement with the opinion of the dissenting member.

At the hearing  of this appeal, the appellant  was represented  by Mr. FAyaz Bojan, Ms. Hadija Kinyaka and Timon Vitalis, all learned advocates, whereas  the respondent had the services of Mr. Amandus Ndayeza,  learned Senior State Attorney, assisted  by Mr. Harold Gugami, learned State Attorney.

In arguing this appeal, Mr. Bojan adopted first the appellant's written submissions  as part of his oral submissions. He preferred  to start with the seventh ground and grounds one to five combined.  The sixth ground was argued by Ms. Kinyaka.

- 7. The Tax Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in law by failing to comply with the mandatory provision of Rule 14(5) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal Rules, 2001 (GN No.57 of 2001) by the tribunal chairman  failing to record the opinion of one of the members of the Tribunal namely, Mr. W.N.

He highlighted  that Mr. Ndyetabula was in disagreement  with other members on the issue concerning accrued amount of Tshs. 600,000,000/=  which he opined that, it should be recontested  by the respondent  (the appellant herein) before the Board within six months of the ruling.

Submitting on grounds one to five of appeal, Mr. Bojan stated that the main contention in these grounds is the duration of the certificate  of incentive and the law applicable. As such, he said, the ceftificate of incentive subject of this appeal was issued under section 17 of the TIA. According to him, way back in 2000 the appellant applied and submitted a feasibility study to the Tanzania Investment Centre  (the nC) to register her project under the TIA and was accordingly issued with a ceftificate of incentive  number 110016 under the above  provisions of the law.

However, the issue arose because in 2004 the Income Tax Act, 2004 (the 2004 Act) came into force while the appellant had already been issued with a certificate of incentive in 2000 which he claimed could not be affected by the change of law. His argument based on the feasibility study of the project  which was of fifteen years. As a result, while in one hand the appellant thought that the law applicable throughout is the Income Tax Act of 1973 (the 1973 Act), on the other hand, the respondent  insisted that the assessment done in the years of income 2006 and 2007 fell under the 2004 Act as the applicable  law in the said respective years of income.

Mr. Bojan argued further that, the application  for the first ceftificate investment of USD 508.5 Million. According to him, it was wrong for the Tribunal to extract excerpts  of witnesses and come up with the holding importing the idea of implementation periods, expansion  and extension contrary to the 15 years'project. He insisted that, since the appellant had which allowed her a deduction of expenditure  at l00o/o, the subsequent certificates issued from the year, 2005 automatically entitled her to of incentive issued in 2000, was one for a 15 years' project with an already been issued with a certificate of incentives  under the 1973 Act

us to allow those grounds  of appeal. continue enjoying  those benefits as a matter of law. Therefore, he urged

In regard to the sixth ground of appeal, Ms. Kinyaka submitted that the dispute is centered on section 16(3Xa)  of the 1973 Act on the deductible interest and the mode of allowing the deduction, whether to apply accrual basis or actual payment basis. According to her, modalities of eligibility of certain deductions may change from time to time. The appellant had not previously  claimed  any deduction of interest because under the then existing section 16(3Xa)  of the 1973 Act, such claim could only be laid on paid basis. She added that, the change of International Financial  Repofting  Standards (the IFRS) that subsequently  became dominant,  led to the depafture from the previous practice. Therefore, the law in keeping  pace  with the IFRS adopted the accrual basis. However, she stated that the appellant had not laid any claim before coming into force of the 2004 Act and therefore,  section 16(3Xa) of the 1973 Act is inapplicable to the matter at hand.

In addition,  she stated that during the year of income 2006 argued, was the first year of applicability of the new law to the appellant who had prepared accounts and repofted her liabilities on accrual basis in

compliance with the IFRS as required by the law; that is, section  21(1) and (3) of the 2004 Act. Therefore, she argued that, it was wrong in law for the Tribunal to hold that in submitting income tax returns and the accompanying  accounts for the years  of income 2006 and 2007, the appellant was required to account for interest on paid basis.

She argued fufther that, the Tribunal was wrong to hold that the appellant was not entitled to claim interest (Tshs. 600,000,000/=) on accrual basis in respect of the interest that was payable  at the time when payable.  She submitted that, based on the requirements of the IFRS and section  23(1) &amp; (3) of the 2004 Act, the appellant was required to comply with the new laws under which interest expense is claimed on accrual basis and not on a paid basis. She urged us to hold that, the appellant had properly claimed a deduction in respect of accrued interest of Tshs. 600,000,000/=  during the year of income 2006, reverse the decision of the Tribunal  and allow this appeal in its entirety with costs. the 1973 Act was in force because the interest had not yet become

In reply, Mr. Ndayeza adopted the respondent's written submissions and suppofted the Tribunal's decision. His submissions in respect of the first to fifth grounds of appeal was to the effect that, the appellant was not

entitled  to 100o/o deduction  of expenditure  incurred and to continued entitlement to utilize the incentives  granted to her prior to the coming into force of the 2004 Act, in respect of certificate of incentive  issued by the Tanzania Investment Centre (the nC) on 21s February, 2002; two ceftificates  of incentives  Nos. 110016/01 issued on 14th March 2005 and 110016/01 of 14th March, 2008 which intended to expand and not to 1973 Act. extend the benefits conferred  on and utilized by the appellant under the

According to him, the second set of ceftificates  issued on 14th March, 2005 and 14th March, 2006 were new agreements which related to a new that, the second set of ceftificate does not confer upon the appellant the benefits of the 1973 Act. He made reference  to the second set of Certificate  of incentives  where clause 12(ii) of the said ceftificate  states categorically  that, the eligibility  for capital allowance  is as per the 2004 Act which does not provide  for 100o/o capital expenditure  deduction. project  of expansion. He thus argued that, the Tribunal was correct to hold

He was categorical that, section L7(2) of the TIA provides for certificate of expansion  which is the difference from the other certificates. He argued that, a certificate or right which was not in existence prior to the

enactment of the 2004 Act cannot be conferred in terms of section 143 of the said Act. Further that, a certificate of incentive represents a binding agreement  between the Government  and the investor, therefore, the terms and conditions  provided in the certificate of incentives must be complied with. As such, he said, the implementation  period stipulated in the certificate of incentive is a life time of the agreement in which tax benefits cannot be enjoyed beyond that time. Thus he argued that, if the appellant was aggrieved by the conditions enshrined in new certificate she ought to have opted to dispute settlement method envisaged under section 23 of the TIA. He emphasized that, the 1973 Act does not apply to the new set of certificate issued in the year 2005 but the 2004 Act. In addition,  he said, the license issued and the feasibility  study conducted have nothing  to do with tax exemption, the only document is ceftificate of incentive.

Responding  on the sixth ground of appeal, Mr. Ndayeza submitted that the Tribunal was also correct to hold that the applicable principle  is the accounting principle  of the year 2003. He added that, in terms of the 1973 Act, interest deducted needed proof  of payment. However, he argued that in the case at hand, the income interest was due before the 2004 Act came into force and thus the accrual basis stated by the counsel

for the appellant cannot apply. He elaborated that interest which accrued and carried forward from the 1973 Act is not deductible  on accrual basis under the 2004 Act.

In regard to the seventh ground of appeal, the counsel for the respondent,  Mr. Gugami submitted that from page 633 to 644 of the record of appeal the opinions  of both members were recorded. However, it was his argument that, failure by the chairman to record in the  judgment  the reason(s)  for his disagreement with the second limb of one of the member's opinion was not fatal. He argued that the substantial part of omission does not go to the root of the matter. Besides, he said, the Tribunal was duly constituted, members signed the proceedings and the chairman is not bound by the opinion of members. members' opinion was considered by the chairman as a result, the

Regarding  the decisions cited by the counsel for the appellant, he argued that they are distinguishable  from the current case because in those cases the issue was whether assessors were fully involved in the trial, but in the current case the issue is on part of the opinion of one member. He urges us to invoke Rule 115 of the Tanzania  Court of Appeal Rules, 2009 (the Rules) to find that the merit of the case was not

prejudiced  and proceed  to determine  the appeal. Finally, he urged us to dismiss this appeal with costs.

In rejoinder, Mr. Bojan reiterated  his submission in chief regarding member's opinion in respect of ground seven of appeal. He insisted that the Tribunal chairman did not record the opinion of one member in the judgment  and did not give the reason(s) for not recording the same. In the clrcumstances, he said, the question  of  prejudice  does not arise, instead Rule 22 of the Tribunal Rules needs to be interpreted  strictly. As such, he said, Rule 115 of the Court Rules cannot supersede the whole Tax statute and that the Tribunal is not the High Court which is referred under the said Rule. He added that all the authorities  he cited are relevant to the matter at hand.

Regarding  grounds  one to five of appeal, he insisted that there was only one project under 15 years feasibility study and not multiple projects as stated by the counsel for the respondent.

On ground six, Ms. Kinyaka rejoined  that the obligation to pay interest before 2004 Act was not there and section 16(3Xa) of the 1973 Act required payment when there was actual payment not when there was an obligation  to  pay.  She insisted that, it was right for the appellant  to account

on accrual basis under the 2004 Act. Therefore, she urged us to allow this appeal  with costs.

We have respectfully considered the rival submissions  by the counsel for pafties,  the  grounds  of appeal and the entire record. We find it apposite at the outset to ascertain the period of tax assessment in connection with the Ceftificate of Incentives issued to the appellant  by the TIC under section 17(1) of the TIA in respect of the first to fifth  grounds  of appeal. As it can be gathered  from the record, the period for tax assessment in question was in respect  of the years of income 2006 and 2007. The bone of contention between  the appellant  and the respondent was on the respondent's disallowance of deductions  (that is, capital expenditure  and shareholders' interest on loan) in the respective years of income. In the light of that background, the issue that follows is, whether the appellant was entitled to 100o/o  deduction of Capital Expenditure.

Section 16(2Xw)  of the Income Tax Ad, 1973 provided for deductibility of capital expenditure at the rate of 100o/o  to the investor who qualifies  for the award of investment incentives. This  provision  was the basis of the appellant's claims for deductions of capital expenditure at the

Board and before the Tribunal. However,  on 4th June, 2004 the 1973 Act was repealed  and replaced by the 2004 Act.

The counsel for pafties differed in their arguments regarding the law to be applicable  in the circumstances as earlier on intimated. However, regarding the repealed law, we are of the opinion that, the Tribunal reasoned rightly on the principles  of statutory interpretation  at page 650 of the record of appeal that:

"...where  a law has been amended, all references to the amended law, unless the contrary intendment appears, shall be read as references to that law as amended. A reference to a law that has been repealed, on the other hand, would depend on the saving provisions (if any) of the new law."

appellant as a saving provision  of section 16(2Xw) of the 1973 Act provides  that: Section 143(1) of the 2004 Act which was much relied by the

"Subject  to the provisions  of subsection (2), where the Government  of the United Republic has concluded  a binding agreement with a person (whether before or after the commencement of this Ad) such that certain provisions  of the repealed legislation or provisions  of this Act that are

later repealed will continue to apply or not be altered to the detriment  of the person,

- (a) the provisions  of the repealed  legislation shall continue to apply,
- (i) to the extent provided for in the agreemenl for the duration of the agreement; or
- (ii) until such time as the person relinquishes  the right to apply those provisions, whichever is earlier..."

The above provision of the law implies  plainly  that, the existence of a binding agreement between the Government  and an investor will continue to apply the provisions  of the repealed law, and the same would not be altered to the detriment of the investor in that respect. But the application of subsection (1) of section 143 of the 2004 Act is subject  to the provisions of subsection  (2) of the same section.  Hence,  in order for an investor to continue enjoying the benefits provided for under section 16(2) (w) of the 1973 Act, must fulfill the condition set forth under section 143(2) of the 2004 Act, which states:

"(2)  An agreement referred to in subsection  (1) has no effect on the application of this Act until such time as it shall be

## incorporated in a register to be kept by the Minister and known as the Register of Tax Agreements."

Regarding the above position,  in our opinion, the Tribunal rightly determined the implications of the Certificate of Incentives  granted  to the appellant  under section 17(1) of TIA as an extension of 2000 agreement while others created a new agreement entered in 2005. Certificate No. 110016/01 dated t41312005 and No. 110016/01 dated 141312006  were in relation to the incentives under the 2004 Act. Therefore,  Certificate of Incentive issued in 2005 was a new ceftificate  and not an extension  of the previous  ones as contended by the appellant. This is evidenced by the wording of the certificate itself as it uses the word "expansion" and not "extension" as it appears in the previous certificates.  This proposition  is supported by the provisions  of section  3 of the TIA which defines investment to mean: "The creation or acquisition of new business assets and includes the expansion, restructuring  or rehabilitation of an existing business enterprise. "IEmphasis added].

Also section t43(4) of the 2004 Act provides that:

"  For the purposes of this sedion, an agreement concluded by the Government of the United Republic includes a ceftificate  of incentive issued by the Tanzanian

## Investment  Centre under the Tanzania Investment Act, 1 9  9  7. "  lEmphasis  addedl.

In the same vein, the issuance  of new certificates, that is certificate No. 110016/01 dated 141312005 and No. 110016/01 dated t41312006 by the TIC in our settled opinion, constituted a new agreement under the provisions  of the above subsection of the 2004 Act. Therefore,  as rightly held by the Tribunal, the certificates were clearly in respect of a new investment, separate from the initial one under which the first sets of certificate were issued. Thus, with issuance of new certificates by the TIC under section 17(1) of the TIA and section t43(4) of the 2004 Act, the parties (Appellant and Respondent) had entered into a new agreement concluded in the pendency of the 2004 Act.

Since the new agreement was entered into after the coming into governed by the provisions  of the repealed 1973 Act. Besides, the ceftificate itself expressly mentioned  the 2004 Act as the applicable law, Therefore, in the circumstances, the applicable law is the 2004 Act. Section 143(2) &amp; (3) of the 2004 Act provides that: force of the 2004 Act, we entertain no doubt that the same could not be

- "(2) An agreement referred to in subsection (1) have no effect on the application of this Act until registered by the Minister  in the Register of Tax Agreements.
- (3) A person seeking the benefit of an agreement referred to in subsection (1) shall apply to the Minister for inclusion of the agreement in the Register of Tax Agreements.

In our settled view, it was correctly decided by the Tribunal that, for the appellant to legally enjoy the benefits of section 143(1) of the 2004 Act, she had to apply to the Minister for Finance under subsection (3) of the said section for the inclusion  of the agreement in the Register of Tax Agreements, but this was not the case herein and thus the appellant cannot rely on the provisions  of section 143 of the 2004 Act. Therefore, we are settled that: First, the appellant  was not entitled to 100o/o deduction  of capital expenditure  as the same is not provided for, under the 2004 Act. Second, the Tribunal properly  interpreted  the provisions of section 16(2) (w) of the 1973 Act. Third, it was correct in law for the Tribunal  to hold that the appellant was not entitled to the continued entitlement to utilize the incentives granted  to them prior to the coming in force of the 2004 Act February 2000. Fourth, the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that the in respect of certificate  of incentives No. 110016 issued by the TIC on 21*

two certificates  of Incentives Nos. 110016/01 issued  on 14th March 2005 and 110016/01 of 14th March 2008 intended to expand and not to extend the unutilized benefits conferred  upon and granted  on the appellant under the 1973 Act. Therefore, these grounds  of appeal are without merit and dismissed.

Now revefting to the sixth ground of appeal, the pertinent issue to be determined  is whether the appellant was entitled to deduction on shareholders' loan interest basing on payment  or accrual basis. In the aspect of interest  allegedly incurred by the appellant on the shareholder's loan for the year of income  2006, the counsel for the appellant maintained that the same should be taken on accrual basis; that is, without actual payment  of the same. This position was strongly contested by the counsel for the respondent. Section 16(3Xa) of the 1973 Act provided  that interest 2004 Act which provides for a deduction in respect of depreciation allowance for depreciable  assets (accrual basis). was deductible  only when actually  paid as opposed to section 17 of the

The appellant's stance was that, the 2004 Act was applicable on deduction of interest on shareholder's loan on accrual basis whereas, the respondent  has relied on the provisions of section 16(3)(a) of the 1973 Act,

section  142(l) of the 2004 Act and sections 31 and 32 of the Interpretation of Laws Act,  [Cap  1 RE 2002] in support  of his argument. Going through all those provisions  of the Laws cited above, it appears that where an obligation  to pay tax arises at a particular point in time, that obligation is to be handled in accordance  with the law applicable at that particular  time, even if the said law is subsequently repealed  and not in accordance with the new law that comes into force after the obligation has arisen.

Therefore, as correctly held by the Tribunal,  in our view, section 142 (1) of the 2004 Act saves the application of the 1973 Act beyond the coming into force of the 2004 Act for the relevant years  of income. The section provides that:

"Subject to the provisions of subsection  (6), the repealed legislation continues  to apply for years  of income commencing prior to the date on which this Act comes into effed. "[Emphasis added],

We agree with the decision of the Tribunal that, since the appellant was supposed to have paid the interest before the enactment of the 2004 Act, the governing law was the 1973 Act even if actual payment of the same is made after its repeal. In the circumstances,  we also agree with the

counsel for the respondent  that the appellant was not entitled to claim interest  on accrual  basis in respect of interest that was payable  at the time when the 1973 Act was in force. As such, we are settled in our mind that, the appellant's obligation to  provide proof  of payment first before claiming deduction remained  intact as if the 1973 Act was still in force. The appellant was not entitled to deduction  of interest on shareholder's loan basing on accrual basis enshrined under the 2004 Act, but on payment basis as provided  for by the 1973 Act as the interest claimed was supposed SAMC WAS being carried forward up to the disputed period  of tax assessment. Having stated so, this ground of appeal also fails. to be paid by the appellant before the repeal of the 1973 Act. Instead, the

Lastly, in the seventh  ground of appeal the main contention by Mr. Bojan was that the chairman of the Tribunal did not record the dissenting opinion of Mr. W. N. Ndyetabula  who was one of the members and failed to assign reasons for not doing so as per the requirements of Rule 14 (5) of the Tribunal Rules. This omission, he said, vitiates proceedings  as decided  in various decisions  of the Court which were earlier on indicated. His arguments were opposed by Mr. Gugami who argued that, failure by the chairman to record the reasons for his disagreement with part of one

of the member's  opinion in the judgment was not fatal because it did not go to the root of the matter. He argued further that, all the cases cited by the counsel for the appellant are distinguishable  from the current case because in those cases, the issue was whether assessors were fully involved in trial which is not the case herein.

In dealing with this ground of appeal, we consider it important,  at first, to determine  whether or not there was a dissenting  opinion of a member of the Tribunal.  Section 20 of the Tax Revenue  Appeals Act  [Cap  408 RE 20101 read together with Rule 14(5) of the Tribunal Rules, 2001 provide that, a Chairman of the Tribunal is not bound by the opinion of members of the Tribunal save when he disagrees with the opinion of any member (s), he shall record the opinion of such member (s) differing with him and reasons for his disagreement.

In the light of the above position  of the law we are constrained to consider what were the issues placed before the Tribunal for as follows: determination. According to the record, the issues before the Tribunal were

- Whether the respondent (Appellant herein) was entitled to 100% deduction  of capital  expenditure. 1

On this issue we note that according to the record of appeal, there was no disagreement between the Chairman and members of the Tribunal as they all agreed that, the appellant was not entitled to 100o/o deduction of capital expenditure as the law applicable was the Income  Tax Act, 2004.

- . Whether the respondent (the appellant herein) was entitled to a deduction of interest allegedly incurred on the shareholder's loan for the year of income 2006 on accrual basis without actual payment  of the same.

Regarding  the above issue, one member of the Tribunal (Prof. Doriye) opined that, the appellant was not entitled to deduction of interest on accrual  basis as the law applicable  was the 1973 Act. On his side, Mr. W. N. Ndyetabula  who was also a member was in agreement with Prof. Doriye's opinion that, the disputed  amount of interest seems to have accrued for the years 2001 to 2006. He was of the further opinion that, the amount of Tsh. 600,000,000/= include an amount of interest deduction on actual  payment basis as well as on accrued basis.

In our considered view, Mr. Ndyetabula's  opinion did not differ substantially with that of the other member as the issue remained to be how the said substantial  amount would be deducted. In this respect

therefore,  we observe  that the holding of the Tribunal was substantially in agreement with what its members had opined, Had it been that, Mr. Ndyetabula's opinion was that, the appellant was entitled to deduction of the claimed interest on accrual basis and the Tribunal's holding was on the opposite,  that could have been a substantial  difference in which the provisions of section 20 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act and Rule 14(5) of the Tribunal Rules could come into play.

We are fortified in this position in view of the fact that at pages 659 and 660 of the record of appeal, on 6h April, 2011 Mr. Ndyetabula signed the decision of the Tribunal together with the other member and the Chairman.  This signifies that he was in agreement  with the contents of that Judgment by endorsing it otherwise he would not have signed it. For clarity, at  page 640 of the record of appeal Mr. Ndyetabula  had stated that:

"The disputed amount of interest seems to have accrued  for the years 2001 to 2006. This implies to include an amount of interest dedudion on actual payment basis as well as on accrued basis. This should have had been specifically indicated  by either the appellant  or the respondent herein as to how much is actual amount and that of the accrued  category.  The appellant  should have been in a better position  to clearly substantiate  the specific amount of

accrual status and the amount considered to be actual payment basis. As the amount in reference is substantial,  to be just accorded to either party  do appear to be inequitable. I am of the opinion that the subject accrued amount of  Tsh. 6O4OOOOOO/=  be recontested  by the respondent herein before the Board within six month of the ruling (sic). The appeal be allowed save for the reseruation  made with regard to the stated accrued sum and each party to bear its own costs." [Emphasis addedl.

It is our further observation  that, the difference in opinion between Mr. Ndyentabula  and Prof. Doriye is that, Mr. Ndyetabula having agreed that the appellant was entitled to actual payment basis, he added that, the accrued basis as well is applicable after having considered that the amount in question (Tshs. 600,000,000/=) was substantial, he opined further that, the same be re-contested by the respondent  (the appellant herein) before the Board within six months of the judgment  and the appeal be allowed save for that reservation.

The position  of the law is very clear that the Chairman is not bound by the opinion of members, all what is required  of him is to assign reasons in case of departure which is not the case herein. The law does not require

the Chairman to take whole sale the members'opinion. The opinion of Mr. Ndyetabula was partly considered  by the Tribunal. We have thoroughly perused the impugned decision of the Tribunal and observed that, there is nowhere the Chairman stated categorically  that he was specifically referring to a certain member's opinion.  The decision was crafted in such a way that members'opinion  was considered and the decision was not of the Chairman alone. However, the law does not envisage a situation where there is partial consideration  of member's opinion. Therefore, we cannot fault the decision  of the Tribunal in that regard as the Chairman  was not bound to give reasons for partial consideration  of member's opinion. In the circumstances, we think, it is not safe to conclude that Mr. Ndyetabula  had a dissenting  opinion. While we agree that the Chairman  did not make specific reference or  pronouncement  of the different opinion of Mr. Ndyetabula  on the issue reproduced above, we think in the judgment he correctly  arrived at a conclusion.

In the interest of substantial  justice we are of the view that, practicability  of the disputed paft  of Mr. Ndyetabula's opinion was problematic  due to a number of reasons: One, the parties  did not pray for the said relief in line with Mr. Ndyetabula's  opinion at the Tribunal;  how

reasoning of the Chairman's decision suggests that he was aware of what was opined by the said member. Two, the Board had already given its decision on a matter which was placed before it; therefore, there was no way the said matter could be sent back to the Board by the respondent for it to decide. Three, Mr. Ndyetabula did not state how the respondent  could go back to the Board while the matter was already before the Tribunal; whether by revision or review, whether the Tribunal could return it or the respondent  make an application. Four, Mr. Ndyetabula  had opined that the appeal be allowed, how then could it be possible for the matter to be returned to the Board for determination? Ceftainly  not legally  practicable. Five, we see that there was no dissenting opinion as stated above, Mr. Ndyetabula  was having different  opinion  and not dissenting opinion. Six, the Chairman agreed with the opinion of Prof. Doriye and paft of Mr. Ndyetabula's opinion as earlier on indicated;  in the circumstances,  he was not obliged to record and give reasons for not considering  different opinion of Mr. Ndyentabula.  Seven, it cannot be legally said with ceftainty  that Mr. Ndyetabula gave a dissenting opinion because he is not a decision maker; what he gave was a different opinion. Therefore, in the circumstances  and then the Tribunal  could grant a relief which is not sought? That apart, the

dissenting opinion  does not arise. for the reasons stated above, the obligation of the Chairman to record the

We had an oppoftunity to peruse all the authorities cited by the counsel for the appellant and we agree with Mr. Gugami that, all of them are distinguishable  from the current case. We shall demonstrate. All cases cited revolved around the following issues: Non-involvement  of assessors in a trial; failure to record opinion of assessors; change of assessors in the mid of trial without assigning  reason(s); conducting trial in the absence of assessor; misdirection or non-direction of assessors on vital  points  of law; failure to record dissenting opinion of assessor; and, the effect of allowing assessor to give opinion  without hearing witnesses  while testifying as was decided in the cases cited.

As earlier on intimated,  all the cases cited above are distinguishable from the circumstances  of the present case. In the current case there was, in our considered  view, no dissenting opinion. Therefore, basing on what we have endeavoured to discuss above, we decline the invitation by Mr. Bojan to find that the Tribunal Chairman erred by not recording the member's dissenting opinion. In our well-considered view, since the opinion of Mr. Ndyetabula was considered  by the Chairman  to the extent

explained above, the decision of the Tribunal was not vitiated as suggested by the appellant's counsel. We thus find the seventh ground  of appeal baseless  and accordingly  dismiss it as well.

For the reasons stated above, we are settled in our mind that this appeal is without merits. Consequently,  we dismiss it in its entirety  with cost.
