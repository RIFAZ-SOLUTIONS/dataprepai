## RULING OF THE COURT

31st October &amp; 7t h  November, 2017

## MWANGESI, J.A.:

The  appellant  herein  was  dissatisfied  by  the  decision  of  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal,  which  was  handed  down  on  the  09t h   October, 2006  wherein,  it  did  uphold  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Board.  Armed  with  four  grounds  of  appeal,  it  seeks  to  fault  the  said decision  of the Tribunal  on  the  reason  that,  it was erroneously arrived  at. In its own words, the memorandum of appeal reads:

- 1. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law,  when it held that, Value Added Tax (VAT) is payable on the excess fuel utilized by M/s  Golden  Construction  Company  to  run  the  Geita  Gold Mine power station.
- 2.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law and fact,  when it held that,  there  was a  vatable (sic) supply o f fuel between  Geita Gold Mine  Limited and Golden  Construction  Company operating the Geita Mine power station.
- 3.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in relying on the un-issued invoice to hold that VAT  is  payable by reason only o f  the existence of the invoices  without giving due regard to section  4 and 5 of  the VAT  Act, 1997.
- 4. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in dismissing the appeal and ordering the appellant to pay costs.
- · Gm the other hand,-the dppea! was strenuously resisted by the respondent.

When  the  appeal  was  called  on  for  hearing  on  the  31s t   October, 2017, jthe appellant  enjoyed  the  services  of Messrs Dr.  Ong'hwamuhana Kfbuta, allan Kileo, Wilson Mukebezi and Ncibert Mwaifani learned counse!, whereas,  the  respondent was  being  advocated  for  by  Mr.  Salvatory Swlti, learned  counsel.  At  the  outset  and before  the  iearned  counsel  could commence to  unleash  their  rival  arguments  on  the  appeal,  we  prompted them  to  address  us  on  the  propriety  of  the  appeal,  which  seemingly,

appeared to be time barred in view of the wording  under the provision of Rule  90  (1)  and  the  proviso  thereto,  of the  Court  of Appeal  Rules,  2009 (the Rules).

In  his submission  before us,  Dr.  Kibuta  learned counsel,  did start by giving  a  brief  account  of  the  timeline  of the  appeal  that,  it  was  initially instituted  as  Civil  Appeal  No.  81  of 2012,  which  was  however,  withdrawn as  per  the  order  of this  Court  dated  the  26t h   day  of  May,  2015.  Thereafterwards,  the  appellant  did  lodge  an  application  at  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  that is, Tax Application  No.  10 of 2015,  for extension  of time within which to file a notice of appeal, which was granted on the 10t h March,  2016.  On the  14t h   March,  2016, the appellant did  lodge a  notice of appeal  and  subsequently,  this  appeal,  which  was  lodged  on  the  21s t January, 2017.  Meanwhile, on the 11t h  March, 2016, the appellant did write a  letter to  the  Registrar of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal,  requesting for a  rectified  decree of the Tribunal,  while  on  the  21s t  September,  2016, he  did  request for  rectified  copies of the  proceedings of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal.  It  was  after  he  had  been  supplied  with  the  requested documents that, the appellant became able to lodge the appeal at hand.

With  regard to the stipulation  under the  provisions of Rule 90  (1) of the Rules that, an appeal  has to be lodged within sixty days from the date of lodging the  notice  of appeal,  except where an  application  for copies of the proceedings has been made within thirty days from the delivery of the decision,  the view of the  learned  counsel  for the appellant  has  been  that, the  provision  is only applicable where a fresh  appeal  is being  lodged.  In a situation  where  an  appeal  is  being  re-lodged  as  it  was  the  case  for  the current appeal, the  provision  does not apply, as it has to  be  read mutatis mutandis with the  previously withdrawn appeal.  In that regard,  Dr.  Kibuta did strongly implore us to find that, the failure by the appellant to apply for copies-of the proceedings within a period of thirty days after delivery of the impugned  decision  in  compliance  with  Rule  90  (1)  of the  Rules,  to  have had no any effect to the appeal at hand.  He was thus of the firm view that, the appeal was properly before the Court.

In  response to the submission of his learned friend,  Mr. Switi learned counsel,  opined  that,  in  terms  of Rule  90  (1)  of the  Rules,  the  appellant was  obligated  to  apply  for  copies  of  the  proceedings  within  the  period stipulated  therein  failure  of which,  could  only  be  remedied  by  way  of an application for extension of time.  In the circumstances, the letter that was written  by the applicant on the  11t h   March,  2016,  which was done without leave  being  sought  and  granted,  was  ineffectual. He  has  vehemently resisted  the  contention  by  Dr. Kibuta  learned  counsel  that,  where  the appeal is to be re-lodged, the provision does not apply. To that end, he did urge  us to  find  the  appeal  at  hand  to  be  time  barred  and  as  such,  it  be struck out.  He has however, not pressed for costs.

In  rejoinder, Dr. Kibuta  did  maintain  his  previous  stance  that,  a distinction  has to  be  drawn  between  an  appeal  being  lodged  afresh,  and the one which  is  being  re-lodged.  Since  in  re-lodging  an  appeal,  some of the processes had already been performed in the previous appeal, redoing chem  in  the fresh  appeal  was  unnecessary if not boring.  And,  in  case we would be convinced that, such practice had indeed to be complied with, he did  invite  us to do away with  it,  for purposes of hastening  dispensation of justice under the spirit fostered  under Article  107 A (2) of the Constitution of the United  Republic of Tanzania,  1977, as well as Rule 4 (1) and (2) of the Court of Appeal Rules.

What  stands  for  our  deliberation  and  determination  in  the  light  of what has been subm'fted above is whether, the appeal at hand is properly before the Court. To appreciate the gist of the arguments advanced by the

learned counsel for both sides, we hereby reproduce the provisions of Rule 90 (1) of the Rules verbatim thus:

"90 - (1) Subject to the provisions of Rule 1 2 8 an appeal shall be instituted by lodging in the appropriate registry,  within sixty days of the date when  the notice of  appeal was lodged with-, .

- (a) a memorandum of  appeal in quintuplicate;
- /h) nf jn qninfzfp/icatej
- (c)  security for costs o f  the appeal,

save that where an application for a copy of  proceedings in the High  Court has been made  within  thirty days of the date of the decision  against  which  it  is  desired  to  appeal, there  shall\ in computing the time within which the appeal is to be instituted be excluded such  time as may be  certified by the Registrar of the High  Court  as  having  been  required  for  the  preparation  and delivery of  that copy to the appellant.

[ Emphasis supplied]

According to his submission,  Dr.  Kibuta  learned counsel,  reserves no doubt to the mandatory requirement that has been  imposed  by the above quoted provision of law to an appellant, who is lodging a fresh appeal.  His dispute  is  on  an  appeal,  which  is  being  re-lodged.  He  did  argue that,  the fact that,  in the  previous appeal, the appellant had already applied for the copies  within  time,  the  provision  cannot  apply  to  the. subsequent appeal.

The question which does crop from such averment, is, what is the effect of an appeal being struck out or withdrawn? The answer to this question has been  answered  by the  Court in  the  previous  matters of the  like.  It is the position  of the  Court that,  once  an  appeal  is  struck  out  or,withdrawn,  it goes away  with everything that accompanied it. See: Pamela P. Bikatumba Vs The Director ABB Tanalec Limited, Civil  Appeal  No. 4 of 2015,  National  Micro  finance  PLC  Vs  Oddo  Odilo  Mbunda, Civil Appeal  No. 91 of 2016,  Azaram  Mohamed  Dadi Vs  Abilah Mfaume, Civil Appeal No. 74 of 2016 (all unreported)'

In Azaram  Mohmaed Vs Abilah  Mfaume (supra) for instance, it was the holding of the Court that: ■ ^

"Unfortunately,  the appellant did not similarly seek any extension of time  within  which  to  file  an  application  for leave  to  appeal to  the Court,  nor could he properly have sought any leave to appeal under section  47 (1) of the Land Disputes Courts Act without the former. The leave to appeal that was once upon a time granted by the High Court,  on  3/^/2Uii,  no  longer survived the striking out ot nts mo incompetent  appeals  to  the  Court,  respectively  on  5/6/2013  and 3/12/2014.  He was required to re-seek leave to appeal thereafter for proper institution of  this appeal,  which inadvertently he did not. He missed a mandatory step Jn the land apnea! process to the Court. It is fata  I'to the appeal."

In  the  same  breath,  the  withdrawal  of appeal  No.  81  of  2012  that was  made  by the appellant in  the  previous appeal  on  the  26t h   May  2015, left  nothing  in  Court  and  as  such,  the  argument  by  Dr.  Kibuta  learned counsel  that,  the  provision  of  Rule  90  (1)  of  the  Rule  had  to  be  read mutatis  mutandis in the  two  appeals,  meaning  with  all  the  necessary changes,  could  not arise,  as there  was  no  any traces  left  in  Court of the previously withdrawn appeal.'It is not surprising therefore, to find that,  in the record of appeal by the appellant, there has never been any mention of 'Civil  Appeal  No.  81  of  2012  which  got  withdrawn,  other  than  by  mere passing, in the order for its withdrawal.

- In the circumstances, the purported certificate of deiay found at page 208 of  the record of appeal dated the 18t h January, 2017, which unfortunately  was  issued  by  the  Registrar  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Tribunal under non-existing law that is, the repealed Court of Appeal Rules,  1979 of which,  nonetheless,  is not the issue under discussion for the moment, was of no avail to the appellant.

To that end, we are constrained to join  hands with  Mr.  Switi learned counsel for the respondent to hold that, the appeal by the appellant is time barred and therefore, improperly before the Court. We hereby strike it out.

And  regard  being to the fact that,  the  learned  counsel  for the  respondent did not press for costs we make no order as to costs.

Order accordingly.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 3r d  day of November, 2017.
