dated the 31s t day of January, 2020 in

Tax Appeal No. 5 of 2019

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

What underlies the present appeal is briefly as follows: The appellant is a   company registered  in Tanzania  involved  in the production and supply of gas for power generation at the Ubungo power plant in  Dar-es-Salaam. It also  deals  with  the  supply  of  natural  gas  to  industrial  and  commercial customers as well as the supply of compressed natural gas for use In  motor vehicles.  On  the other hand, the  respondent is the Chief Executive Officer of the  Tanzania  Revenue Authority charged  with  assessing  and  collecting various  taxes  and  revenues  on  behalf  of the  Government  of the  United Republic of Tanzania.

On  2/3/2016,  the  respondent  issued  a  notice  of assessment  No.  F 420838951  to  the  appellant  for  the  year  of  income 2014  with  the chargeable income of TZS.  84,228,425,576.50,  notice of original/adjusted/ jeopardy assessment No.  F14040 and  notice of amended  assessment  No. F4210471999  for  the  year  of  income  2013.  Discontented,  the  appellant lodged notices of objection against the assessment and applied for a waiver of one third  tax  deposit  required  for the  admission  of the  objection.  The respondent  declined  to  grant  the  waiver  for  reasons  that,  the  grounds fronted  by  the  appellant  to  apply  the  waiver  were  also  pleaded  in  the

notices  of  objection  and  as  such,  could  not  be  dealt  with  before  the determination of the objection.

Aggrieved with the refusal of waiver, the appellant lodged before the Board,  Appeals  Nos. 149  of  2016; 187  and 188  of  2017  which  were consolidated and  heard as one. The Board ultimately dismissed the appeal on ground that the respondent was justified to refuse the grant of waiver. Still  undaunted,  the  appellant  lodged  an  appeal  before  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) which was struck out for being incompetent.  The  holding  of the Tribunal  is  reflected  at  page  881  of the record of appeal as follows:

"In the same spirit,  we are of  settled mind that the purported  Tax Appeals 149 of 2016,  187 of 2017 and 188 of 2017 before the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board  which  did  not  result  from  an objection decision of the Commissioner General were incompetent Consequently, the  present  appeal before the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal is incompetent We  therefore  strike  out  the  three appeals  which  were  lodged  at  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals  Board  for  being  incompetent  and  the decision  and proceedings of the Board are hereby

## nullified.  The instant  appeal before the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  is  struck out  for  being incompetent

It  is  against the  said  backdrop,  the  present appeal  found  its way to the  Court whereby  the appellant,  as  earlier  stated,  is  challenging the decision  of the Tribunal.  In the  Memorandum of Appeal, the appellant  has fronted three grounds of complaint as follows:

- 1.  That, the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal grossly erred in law by holding that the Tax Appeal  No.  5 of 2019  before the Tribunal was incompetent for being against a non-appealable decision.
- 2.  That, the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal grossly erred in law by holding that the Tax Appeals before the Board, Tax Appeal  No. 149 of 2016 and Tax Appeals  Nos  187 and  188 of 2017 were incompetent for being on non-objection decision.
- 3.  That, the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in  law for failing to consider the appellant's submissions on legal arguments that the  respondent's decision  refusing  to grant one third  waiver is appealable decision.

To  bolster their  arguments for  and  against the appeal,  parties  filed written  submissions.  At  the  hearing,  the  appellant  was  represented  by Messrs.  Fayaz Bhojani and William  Mang'ena,  learned counsel whereas the respondent  had  the  services  of  Ms.  Consolatha  Andrew  and  Mr.  Marcel Busegano,  both  learned  Senior State Attorneys and  Messrs.  Leyan Sabare and Amandus Ndayenza, both learned State Attorneys.

In the course of hearing the appeal, the learned counsel for each of the  parties  adopted  the  written  submissions.  However,  following  a  brief dialogue with the Court,  Mr.  Fayaz abandoned contents and all  references in  the  written  submissions  relating  to the  constitutionality or otherwise of the  limitation  on  the  available  remedy  of challenging  the  refusal  to  grant the  waiver.  Then,  Mr.  Fayaz  commenced  his  address  to  the  Court  by submitting that, in the present appeal, what is in dispute, is the interpretation  of the  provisions of the Tax Administration Act of 2015 (the TAA) and the Tax Revenue Appeals Act [ CAP 408 RE.2002] (the TRAA) on the  tax  payer's  remedy  in  the  event  of the  respondent's  refusal  to  grant waiver  to  deposit  one  third  of  the  assessed  tax  in  order  to  validate  the notice of objection. He pointed out that, while under section 50 (1) of the TAA, the CG has discretion to make any tax decision including 'assessment'

or 'other decision7  or 'omission',  in  case  of a  grievance,  section  51  of the TAA regulates the  manner of lodging  an  objection  subject to  payment of one third deposit.

It was further contended that, the law mandates the respondent with discretion to reduce or waive the amount to be paid upon being moved by the tax payer, in case the waiver is refused, that is among  the contemplated "other decisions" or "omissions" which are appealable to the Board in terms of section 53 (1) of the TAA because section 7 of the TRAA clothes  the Board  with  exclusive  original  jurisdiction  to  entertain civil matters relating to the interpretation of revenue laws administered  by the respondent.  Appeals emanating therefrom  lie to the Tribunal  and  there  is no  limitation  on  the  nature  of  appeals  thereto. As  such,  the  appellant faulted the Tribunal by focusing solely on the provision of section  16 (1) of the Tax  Revenue  Appeals Act  instead  of  considering  it together with  the extensive  right  of appeal  as  articulated  under  section  53  (1)  of the TAA. This,  it was  argued,  culminated  into the  striking  out of the  appeal  which was  irregular  because  the  appellant's  right  of  appeal  against  refusal  to grant  the  waiver,  is  embraced  in  'other  decisions'  or  'omissions'  of  the Commissioner General.

Apart from  attacking  the  limited  appealable  decisions  as  prescribed under section  16  (1)  of the  TRAA,  to  be  a  drafting  oversight,  it  was  the argument of Mr.  Fayaz that, there is no clarity as to how a tax  payer can invoke  a  remedy  of  an  appeal  to  the  Board  against 'other  decisions'  or 'omissions' of the respondent.  He thus urged the Court to read sections 16 (1),  (3),  1 9  of the TRAA together with  sections 50,  52,  53  (1) of the TAA, Rules  2  and  6  of the Tax  Appeals  Board  Rules and  invoke  a  harmonious construction  so as to meaningfully give effect the phrase 'other decisions' or 'omissions' in  section  50 and  53  of the TAA. To support his proposition, he  referred us  to  a Book  titled Introduction  to  Interpretation  of Statutes, 4t h Edition  by  Avtar  Singh  and  Harpreet  Kaur.  Ultimately,  the appellants  counsel  urged  the  Court  to  allow  the  appeal  and  reverse  the decision  of the Tribunal.  Moreover,  cases cited  by the appellant's  counsel included: TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY VS TANGO TRANSPORT COMPANY  LIMITED, Civil Appeal  No. 84  of  2009  and TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY VS  KOTRA COMPANY LIMITED, Civil  Appeal No.  1 2  of 2009 (both unreported).

On  the other hand, the respondent opposed the appeal and supported the Tribunal's decision in striking out the incompetent appeal for being  preferred  against  a  non-appealable  decision  before  the  Board.  He pointed  out that,  although  section  7  of the  TRAA  clothes  the  Board  with sole  original  jurisdiction  to  entertain  and  adjudicate  disputes  of  a  civil nature relating to the tax laws administered by the respondent, in terms of section  16  (1)  of the  TRAA what  is  appealable  to  the  Board  is  solely  an objection decision arising from a tax decision made by the respondent. On this,  it  was  argued  that  since  section  2   of the  TAA  defines  an  objection decision  to  be  a  tax  decision  made  under  section  52  of  the  TAA,  it  is incorrect  to  classify  the  refusal  to  grant  waiver  as  'other  decisions'  or 'omissions' of the respondent in terms of section 50 (3) and (4) of the TAA and Rule 93 of  the Tax  Administration (General) Regulations, 2016 Government Notice No.  101 of 18/3/2016.

The respondent as well, challenged the appellant's reliance on section 16 (3) of the TRAA which regulates the service of the notice of appeal and that it has nothing to do with the rejection to grant the waiver. Finally, the respondent submitted that the appellant's invitation to the Court to invoke harmonious  interpretation  on  what  constitutes  an  objection  decision  is uncalled  for  because the same was adequately addressed and determined in  the  case  of PAN  AFRICAN  ENERGY TANZANIA  LIMITED VERSU

THE  COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  TRA, Civil  Appeal  No. 121  of  2018 (unreported).

The  respondent  urged  the  Court  not  to  consider  the  cases  of TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY VS TANGO TRANSPORT COMPANY  LIMITED (supra)  and TANZANIA  REVENUE  AUTHORITY VS KOTRA COMPANY LIMITED, (supra)  relied  upon  by  the  appellant's counsel  as  they  relate  to  disputes  which  were  wrongly  filed  in  the  High Court which is not the case herein. Finally, the respondent urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  rejoinder,  apart  from  Mr.  Fayaz  conceding  that  the  appeal  was preferred under section  16 (1) of the TRAA,  he averred the same to be in line  with  the  standard  forms  used  in  filing  appeals  before  the  Board. However, he submitted that the main concern of the appellant is about the lacking remedial measures  in  case  a  waiver  is  refused vis  a vis the Tribunal's  decision limiting nature  of  appeals  which he  viewed  to  be dangerous.  He  also  contended  that,  Rule  93  of  the  Tax  Administration (General)  Regulations cannot override the  provisions of section  51  of the TAA which  regulates  objections to  tax  decisions.  On  the  definition  of  an

objection  decision  under  section  2  of  the  TAA,  he  reiterated  his  earlier prayer urging the Court to read the Act as a whole and make a harmonious interpretation  of  the  law  to  give  effect  the  intention  of  the  lawmakers. When  probed  by  the  Court  on  the  settled  position  of  the  law  on  the objection  decisions being  solely appealable,  he  urged  the  Court to depart from its earlier decision in PAN AFRICAN case (supra).

Having  carefully  considered  the  rival  submissions of learned  counsel from either side,  it is not in dispute that section  7 of the TRAA clothes the Board with sole original jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate disputes of a  civil  nature  relating to the tax  laws administered  by the  respondent and that the appeals therefrom lie to the Tribunal. What is in dispute is whether the refusal to grant waiver to deposit one third of the assessed tax is a tax decision which is appealable to the Board in terms of section  16 (1) of the TRAA. This constitutes a question of law to be determined  by the Court as per the dictates of section 25 (2) of the TRAA.

As  we  have  been  called  upon  to  construe  several  provisions  in  the TRAA and TAA relating to what is in dispute, we begin with the four rules of Statutory Interpretation to wit: the literal rule; the golden rule; the mischief

rule and the purposive approach. Which rule is the best?  The golden rule is that  the  words  of  a  statute  must prima  facie be  given  their  ordinary meaning.  It is yet another  rule  of construction  that when  the  words  of a statute are clear, plain and unambiguous, then the courts are bound to give effect to that meaning irrespective of the consequences. See -httD://www.lawctoDUS.com.canons.

We also deem  it crucial  to  borrow a  leaf from  the  Book which  was referred and availed to us by the appellant's counsel titled: Introduction to  Interpretation  of Statutes, by AVTAR SIGNH  and  HARPREET KAUR 4th EDITION. The learned Authors observed at pages 5  and 6 as follows:

"The  most and rational method for interpreting  a statute is by expioring the intention o f  the legislature through the most natural and probable signs which are  either  the words, the  context, the  subjectmatter,  the effects and consequences,  or the spirit and reason of  the law. in the court of  iaw what the legislature intended to be done or not be done can only be  legitimately ascertained from  that  what it has chosen to enact,  either in express words or by reasonable and  necessary  implication.

But  the  whole  of what  is  enacted  'by  necessary implication can hardiy be determined without keeping in the purpose of object of the statute. A bare  mechanical  interpretation  of the  words  and application of  legislative intent devoid of  concept or purpose will  reduce  most  of  the  remedial  and beneficent  legislation to futility....

Ordinarily,  the determining factor of intention  o f a statute  is  the  language  employed in  the  statute. Gajendragadkar J,  said In a case that 'the first and primary rule of construction is that the intention of the legislature must be found in the words used by the legislature itself'..."

The  area  on  the  canons  of  interpretation  to  be  invoked  in  the construction of statutes when the words are unambiguous is not grey in our jurisdiction and  in the case of REPUBLIC VS MWESIGE GEOFREY AND ANOTHER, Criminal Appeal No. 355 of 2014 (unreported) the Court said:

"...i n  the familiar canon o f  statutory construction of plain  language, when  the  words  of a  statute  are unambiguous, judicial inquiry is  complete  because the courts must  presume that  a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what is  says there. As  such, there  is  no need  for

interpolations, iest we  stray  into the exclusive preserve  of  the  legislature under  the  cioak  of overzeaious interpretation."

[ See  also  RESOLUTE  TANZANIA  LIMITED  VS  COMMISSIONER GENERAL* TRA, Civil Appeal No. 125 of 2017, MBEYA  CEMENT COMPANY LIMITED VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL TRA, Civil Appeal No.  160  of  2017 COMMISSIONER GENERAL TRA VS  ECOLAB  EAST AFRICA  (TANZANIA) LIMITED, Civil Appeal No.35 of 2020 (all unreported)]. We shall  be guided  by among  others,  the stated  position  in determining the case under scrutiny.

It  was  the  appellant's  counsel  proposition  that,  the  refusal  by  the respondent to grant the waiver is covered by the phrases "other decisions" or "omissions" in what constitutes a tax decision can be discerned from the provisions of section 50 of the TAA which stipulates as follows:

"50.  -(1)  The Commissioner General may, subject to subsection (2),  make any tax decision including assessment  or  other  decision  or  omission  on  a matter  left  to  the  discretion,  judgment,  direction, opinion, approval, consent, satisfaction or

## determination of the Commissioner Generai under a tax  law that  directly  affects  a  person."

For  a number  of  reasons,  we  found  the  appellant's  submission wanting. We say so because: Firstly, in  terms of section 50 (1) of the TAA, the respondent is mandated to make any tax decision including 'assessment'  or  'other  decision7   or  'omission'  on a matter  left  to  the discretion, judgment,  direction,  opinion,  approval,  consent,  satisfaction  or determination  of the  Commissioner General  under a  tax  law  that directly affects  a  person. Secondly, in  terms  of  subsection  (3),  a  tax  decision under section  50 of the TAA is considered to have been  made in case of: self-assessment, on the due date of filing the tax return; other assessments,  when  the  notice  of assessment  is  served  on  the  taxpayer; and any other tax  decision  where,  the tax specifies  a  time  by which  the Commissioner General  is to make the decision; or when the Commissioner General  serves  the  affected  person  with  written  notice  of  the  decision. in terms  of  subsection (4), three  circumstances  constituting a tax decision has been  made and the decision correct are: (i) self-assessment, the tax return that causes the

Thirdly, conclusive evidence that is assessment or a  document under the  hand  of the  Commissioner General

purporting to be a copy of the tax return; (ii) other assessments, the notice of assessment or a document under the hand of the Commissioner General purporting to be a copy of the notice; ( iii) any other tax decision, a written notice  of the  decision  under the  hand  of the  Commissioner General  or a document under the hand of the Commissioner General purporting to be a memorandum of the decision.

It  is  glaring  that  the  whole  of section  50  defines and  regulates tax decisions  left  to  the  discretion,  judgment,  direction,  opinion,  approval, consent,  satisfaction  or  determination  of  the  Commissioner  General.  In particular,  under  section  50  (1)  of  the  TAA,  the  preposition  ' including' between the phrases 'any tax decision' and Assessment' or 'other decision' or 'omission' means that the former is a  larger group which embraces the latter.  This  is  cemented  by  a  latin  maxim  of ejusdem generis rule  which means 'of the same kind'. The rule requires that: where in a statute there are genera! words following particular specific words,  the genera1  words must  be  confined  to  things  of  the  same  kind  as  those  specifically mentioned. http://ca.Dracticallaw.thomsonreuters.com. This was emphasized  by  the  Supreme  Court  of the  United  States  in  the  case  of CIRCUIT CITY STORES INC VS ADAMS, 532 US  105  [2001], whereby

the maxim was defined as: "situation in which generai words follow  specific words  in  statutory  enumeration, the  generai  words  are  construed  to embrace oniy objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated  by the preceding specific words."

Moreover,  in  a  book titled Kanga and Palkhivala's the  Law and Practice of INCOME TAX by Arvind P.  Datar 11t h   Edition, at page  10 the learned author has discussed as to when the rule of ejusdem generis can be applicable in the following terms:

"The  rule  of ejusdem  generis  is  intended  to  be applied where  generai  words  have  been used following particular or specific  words  o f the  same nature.  The Ruie of ejusdem generis applies when (1)  the statute  contain  an  enumeration  o f specific words,  (2) the subject of enumeration construes a class or category,  (3) that class or category is not exhausted  by  the  enumeration, (4)  the  general terms  following  enumeration  and  (5)  there  is  no indication of  a different  legislative intent. It  serves to restrict the meaning of  the general words to thing or matters  of  the  same  genus  as  the  preceding particular words. For the invocation of  the rule there must be one distinct  genus or category.  The specific

words must apply not to different objects of  a widely varying character  but to words that convey things or objects of one  class or kind....  Thus the restricted meaning has to be given to words of  general import only  where  the  context  of the  whole  scheme  of legislation requires  it "

In the light of the ejusdem generis rule, the phrase any tax decision including is a  general  large family  which  includes 'assessment7 , 'other decisions'  or  'omissions' to  be  part  of  the  larger  family  that  is,  'tax decision". We are fortified in that account because in order to ascertain the meaning of a clause in a statute, courts must look at the whole statute, at what precedes and what succeeds and not merely the clause itself and also compare the clause with other parts of the law and the setting in which  it occurs. If we can apply the rule therefore, the phrases 'other decisions' or 'omissions' must be of the same nature as tax decisions and not otherwise. Thus,  in  the  light of the  unambiguous and  plain  language used  in  section 50 (1) of what is a tax decision, we are satisfied that,  refusal to grant the waiver  is  excluded  in  the  realm  of  what  constitutes  a  tax  decision  and neither is it an objection decision. This was emphasized in the case of PAN

AFRICAN  ENERGY TANZANIA  LTD  VS  COMMISSIONER  GENERAL (TRA) (supra)  whereby,  having  considered  sections,  51  and  53  of TAA

which makes cross reference to the effect that an appeal to the Board has to be in accordance with section 16 (1) of the TRAA we said:

"...it is significantly discernible that an appeal to the Board is presently narrowed down to an objection decision of  the CG  made under the TAA. It  is beyond question that,  in the situation at hand,  there is,  so far,  no objection decision of  the CG and,  to say the Ieast,  going  by specific  language  used in  section 16(1),  the purported appeal before the  TRAB which did not result from an objection decision of the CG was incompetent"

We find the said decision still good law and as such,  we decline the appellant's counsel invitation to depart from it.

Without  prejudice  to  the  aforesaid,  the  appellant's  counsel  also invited  us to  consider that the  refusal  of waiver is  among  the  appealable decisions  envisaged  by  Rule  6  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Board  Rules  which prescribes the documents which must accompany the appeals to the Board. Indeed,  the  said  Rule  was  not  brought  to  our  attention  and  it  was  not considered in the PAN AFRICAN case (supra) and as such, we shall now consider it.  Rule 6 stipulates as follows:

- "6 . -(1) A  person  who  institutes an  appeai to  the Board shaii attach aii material documents which are necessary  including  appealable decision , for  the proper determination of  the appeal.
- (2) Without  prejudice  to  sub-ruie  (1), appeal  shall  contain the following documents-
- (a) where the appeai is against objection decision of  the Commissioner GeneraI-
- (i) a copy of  a notice of  assessment of  tax;
- (ii)  a copy  of  notice  of  objection to an assessment  submitted  to Commissioner General  by  the appellant;
- (Hi) a  copy of the finai objection decision  of assessment of  tax  or  any other  decision by the Commissioner General being appealed against;
- (iv) a copy of  a notice issued by the Commissioner General regarding the existence of  liability to pay tax, duty, fees, levy  or  charge;
- (v) a copy of the notice of  proposal on how the Commissioner  wants  to  settle  the objection (if  any);

the

- (vi) a copy of  submission made by taxpayer in response to the notice o f  appeal, (if  any);
- (b) where  the  appeal relates  to  refusal  by  the Commissioner  Genera!  to  admit  a  notice  of objection, a copy  of  the  decision  of  the Commissioner  GeneraI  to  admit  a  notice  of objection;
- (c) where the appeal  refates to-
- (i) refund,  drawback  or repayment  of any tax, fee, duty, levy or charge, a statement showing the calculation  by the appellant of the amount due for refund,  drawback or  repayment  o f  any tax, fee, duty, levy  or charge;
- (ii) refusal by the  Commissioner  GeneraI to make any refund or repayment; a copy of the decision of  the Commissioner General refusing to refund; and
- (d) where the appeal  relates to the decision by the Commissioner General to register, or  refusal to register.  Any  trader  for  the  purpose  o f the Value  Added Tax  Act, a copy of  the decision of the Commissioner General.

Having  scrutinized  the  plain  language  used  in  the  cited  Rule,  the envisaged  appealable  objection  decisions  are  where one, the  appeal  is against objection  decision  of the  Commissioner General; two, the appeal relates  to refusal by  the  Commissioner  General  to  admit  a  notice  of objection; three, the  appeal  relates  to  refund  drawback  and four, the appeal  relates to the decision  by the Commissioner General to register, or refusal to  register,  any trader for the  purpose of Value Added Tax.  In this regard,  it  is  clear  that,  the  refusal  to  grant  waiver  is  not  among  the envisaged appealable decisions and we believe, the exclusion was deliberately  so because  it  is  neither  a  tax  decision nor  an  objection decision.  Besides,  the  waiver is excluded  under the  rule " expressio unius est dusio a/teriuf which  means,  when  one or  more things  of the same class  are  expressly  mentioned  others of the same class are excluded.  On this  account,  we  subscribe  to  what  the  two  learned  authors  observed  in their  book titled: Introduction to Interpretation of Statutes, at page 23 (supra) as follows:

"When the language of  a statute is plain,  words are dear and unambiguous and give only one meaning, then  effect should be given  to  that plain  meaning only  and one should  not  go in for construction o f  the

statute. When a language is plain and unambiguous and admits of  only one meaning no question of  construction of  a statute arises, for the Act speaks for itself It is not open to first create  on  ambiguity and  then  look  for some principle of interpretation . Courts should not be  overzealous  in  searching  for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain.

In  view  of  the  aforesaid,  we  decline  the  appellant's  invitation  to interpret  the  refusal  to  grant  waiver  a  tax  decision  because  since  the language used  in the TRAA and TAA is plain, the legislative intent is vivid and  to  do  otherwise  as  suggested  by  the  appellant,  is  to  embark  on interpolations which is not giving effect to the clear meaning of the statutes in question.  In the same vein,  in the absence of any inconsistencies in the provisions  in  question  that the  refusal to grant the waiver  is  neither a  tax decision  nor  an  objection  decision  which  can  be  appealed  against  before

the  Board,  we  decline  the  appellant's  counsel  invitation  to  invoke  the harmonious construction of the provisions in question.

We  have  also  read  the  objects  and reasons  in  the  Special Bill Supplement No. 4 of 12/5/2014 for the enactment of the Tax Administration Act which also amended several Tax legislation including the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act.  The  objects  and  reasons  among  other things, included the following:

"Tangu kuanzishwa kwa Mamlaka ya Mapato pamoja na  maboresho yaiiyofanyika,  pamekuwa na  ugumu wa  utekelezaji  wa  sheria  za  kodi  katika  maeneo yafuatayo: -

- (i) Not  applicable.
- (ii)Not  applicable
- (iii) Kuwepo kwa usumbufu kwa waiipa kodi unaotokana na taratibu  za usimamizi  na utawala zinazotofautiana kwa  kifa  aina  ya  kodi  ambayo  wakati  mwingine husababisha waiipa kodi kupoteza haki  zao za msingi biia sababu."

We are aware that the Objects and Reasons in the Bill of the intended piece of legislation  can  be  invoked  by  the  Court to  read  the  intention  of Parliament  in  enacting  a  particular  legislation.  However,  from  the  stated

objects,  we  could  not discern  if the  Parliament had  intended  to  make the refusal  to grant of the waiver, a  tax decision  which  is appealable.  We say so because,  it is glaring  that the enactment of the Tax Administration Act among  other things,  consolidated  the  dispute  resolution  processes which prior to the enactment of TAA also happened to be under the TRAA. This is evidenced  by the  repeal of sections  12,13 and  14 amendments to section 16  in  the  TRAA,  which  were  replaced  in  the  TAA  in  the  enactment  of section  50,  51,  52 and  53 governing the tax decisions,  procedure to apply waiver and objection decisions which are appealable to the Board subject to complying with the TRAA.  Besides, the refusal to grant the waiver was not given a status of being either a tax decision or objection decision which  is appealable  to  the  Board.  Since  ordinarily,  the  determining  factor  of  the intention  of  a   statute  is  the  language  used  in  the  statute,  the  first  and primary rule of construction is that the intention of the legislature must be found  in the words used  by the legislature itself. This was emphasized  by Lord  Brougham  who in the case of ROBERT WIGRAM CRAWFORD VS RICHARD SPOONER 4  M.A 179 having considered about the importance of the text of the statute at page 187 he said:

I f the Legislature did intend that which it has not clearly  expressed:  much  more,  if the  Legislature intended something very different; if  the Legislature intended pretty nearly the opposite of what is said, it is not for  judges to invent something which they  do  not  meet  within  the  words  of the text..."

We fully  subscribe  to  the  said  observation  and  as  such,  again,  we decline the appellant's counsel invitation to read and improvise what is not in the statute namely, TAA and TRAA.

Before we pen off, we  have to address the appellant's grievance on the limitation  imposed  by the legislation  rendering the refusal  to grant the waiver non-appealable. Referring to the impugned decision of the Tribunal, the  appellant's  counsel  viewed  this  to  have  been  occasioned  by  bad drafting  of  the  provisions  in  question  curtailing  the  appellant's  right  of appeal to the  Board. We found the assertion wanting  because jurisdiction of the court is a  creature of statute and as such,  we cannot venture  into

inserting an appellate mechanism in the legislation as that is going beyond the  enactment  regulating  resolution  of tax  disputes  as  articulated  in  the TRAA and straying  into the exclusive preserve of the legislature under the cloak of overzealous  interpretation.  We are fortified  in  that account  being aware that when words of a statute are clear and capable of giving a plain meaning,  the  intention  of  the  Legislative  should  be  gathered  from  the language  used  and  attention  should  be  paid  to  what  has  been  said  and what has not been said. Thus, the courts should not busy themselves with supposed intention as suggested by the appellant's counsel.

We have gathered that in  Uganda,  whose tax  laws are more or less similar with those applicable in Tanzania, an attempt was made to question the legality of the requirement that an objection of tax assessment must be subject to 30% deposit of the assessed tax in FUELEX (U)  LIMITED VS UGANDA REVENUE AUTHORITY, Tax Application  No.  25  of 2007.  The Tax Appeals Tribunal declined to determine the issue that was not within its jurisdiction and referred the matter  to  the Constitutional Court. The FUELEX case equally cements our position that, although the requirement to deposit waiver and the Commissioner General's discretion to refuse the same  are  schemed  under the TAA,  that  in  itself does  not clothe  the  tax

courts  with  jurisdiction  to  determine  the  propriety  or  otherwise  of  the refusal to grant the waiver.

In  view  of what  we  have  endeavoured  to  discuss,  we  are  satisfied that  the  Tribunal  was  justified  to  strike  out  the  appellant's  appeal  on account of being preferred to the Board against a non-appealable decision. Thus, we find no cogent reasons to reverse the decision of the Tribunal and the appeal is hereby dismissed with costs.
