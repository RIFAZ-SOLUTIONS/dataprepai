Tax Appeal No. 77 of 2020

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

16th  &amp; 30t h  August, 2023

## MDEMU. J.A.:

This  appeal  intends  to  challenge  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (TRAT)  which  affirmed  the decision  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Board (TRAB) upholding the decision of the respondent herein which required  the Appellant to  pay  Railway  Development  Levy  (RDL)  following importation of JET A1 aviation fuel for home consumption.

Facts giving  rise to this appeal  as per the  record  of appeal  are that; the  appellant,  Total  Tanzania  Limited  imported  aviation  fuel  JET  A1  and declared it to be for home consumption. The said aviation fuel was consumed by international airlines fuelled in Tanzania. Following that declaration, on 15t h   November,  2015  the  respondent  issued a  demand  note  requiring the appellant to pay RDL amounting to TZS 436, 459, 459.00. The demand was in terms of the provisions of section 20A of the Railways Act, Cap.  170. The appellant appealed to the TRAB  resisting such tax liability by the respondent's  final  decision  dated  3r d   April,  2017.  The  main  focus  of  the appeal  was that,  the said  aviation fuel  was  not  meant for free circulation locally thus could not attract RDL. The said appeal was however dismissed, so was a further appeal  to the TRAT.  In  both TRAT and TRAB,  the  main thrust hinges on one major concern namely; whether the declared aviation fuel attracts RDL. Aggrieved further by the latter's judgment and decree, the appellant preferred the instant appeal on the following grounds:

- 1.  The Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  erred  in law  in holding that  the respondent was correct  in law to impose Railway Development Levy on the appellant for the period 2015 to 2017.

- 2.  The Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  erred  in law  in holding that the fuel  imported  by the appellant was consumed  in Tanzania in terms of  the Law.
- 3.  The Tax Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  erred  in law by failing to hold  that  in terms  of  Chapter  1  of  Annex  B  of  the World Customs Organization Protocol  of2008, the fuel  imported by the appellant was not  for  home consumption.

On 16th  August, 2023 when this appeal was called on for hearing, the appellant  company  was  represented  by  Mr.  Alan  Kileo,  learned  counsel whereas the respondent had the services of Mr. Hospias Maswanyia, learned Senior State Attorney.  At the inception of his submission  in support of the appeal, Mr. Kileo  adopted his  written submission  filed  earlier  on  and thereafter submitted all the grounds of appeal in two-fold. One, that JET A1 imported  by  the  appellant  and  sold  to  international  airlines  is  non  RDL taxable and two, that the act of the respondent to impose RDL under the circumstances  was  in  total ignorance  and  in  violation  of  fundamental principles of taxation.

The appellant's counsel amplified further that, the appellant's wisdom guided him to declare JET A1 for home consumption because other available options such as on transit, for export or for temporary use were not feasible under the circumstances.  He thus faulted both the TRAT and TRAB to base tax liability on that declaration because, to him, that will not change the fact that the fuel was not used in Tanzania.  The learned counsel took that view on the understanding that, fuel filled in international aircrafts at the airport in Tanzania was consumed abroad and therefore the provisions of section 20A of the  Railways Act and  section  2(2)  of the  East African  Community Customs Management Act, 2004 [R.E 2019] (the EACCMA) are inapplicable. The learned counsel thus implored us to borrow a leaf from the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of  Customs  Procedures  (as  Amended),  Customs  Co-operation Council  (World  Customs  Organization), B-1210  Bruxelles  (the Convention) regarding the definition of goods declared for free circulation. Basing on that submission, the leaned counsel urged us to allow this appeal.

In resisting the appeal, along with the contents of the adopted written submission, the leaned Senior State Attorney submitted that, an important component initiating any tax regime is the declaration by the taxpayer which in the instant appeal, the appellant declared JET AI for home consumption. It is following that declaration by the appellant, out of the available options such  as  on  transit, for  export  or  for  temporary  use,  the  respondent demanded RDL taxable under the provisions of section 20A of the Railways Act.  On this observation, his understanding of fuel pumped into international aircrafts is one mode of consumption and therefore consumables other than for  export  purposes.  His  stance  hinges  on  the  fact that,  if such  fuel  was meant  for  export, then it would not have been  declared  for home consumption  and  instead,  the  provisions of section  34 of the  EACCMA on procedures for export of goods would follow suit.

The  learned  counsel  concluded  by  submitting  that,  the  appellant's move of borrowing  a  leaf from  "the Convention" on  the  definition  of the phrase goods in free circulation is  unnecessary because,  the definition provided for under the provisions of section 2(2) of the EACCMA suffices and is exhaustive on that aspect.  He thus implored  us to consider the declared JET Al subject to RDL under section 20(A) of the Railways Act.

Having heard from the parties and upon our consideration of the entire record,  we  find  to  be  uncontested  that,  the  appellant imported JET A l  in

Tanzania;  declared  the  consignment  for  home  consumption  and  sold  to international  aircrafts  of various  destinations  commencing  their trips from Tanzania  Mainland.  It  is  following  that  declaration,  as  said,  is  when  the respondent  imposed  RDL  at  the  tune  of TZS  436,459,459.00.  As  stated earlier,  which  also  parties  are  at  one,  is  that,  RDL  is  levied  under  the provisions of section  20A of the Railways Act as of 1s t July,  2015. Parties however parted their ways on one aspect which gave rise to the issue as to whether  the  declared  JET  A1  for  home  consumption  is  non-exempt  or exempted from RDL. The TRAT, so was the TRAB, interpreted the provisions of section  20A of the  Railways Act and  Section  2(2)  of the  EACCMA thus subjected JET A1 to RDL. For clarity, we reproduce the relevant provisions as hereunder:

20  A  (1)  There shall be charged a levy known as Railway Development Levy.

- (2)  The levy referred to under subsection (1) shall be charged -
- a)  At the rate of 1.5 percent at customs  value on importation of  goods; and

- b) On  goods  entered  for  home  consumption  in Mainland Tanzania in accordance with procedures appiicabie under  the East  African Community Customs Management  Act"

At the outset, we are mindful to outrightly pronounce ourselves on the import of section 34 of  the EACCMA  regarding exportation of the consignment  (JET  Al)  pointed  out  by  both  counsels. This  is  also  so particularly as hinted in their submissions regarding options available at the door  of  the  appellant  during  declaration  of  the  consignment.  They  both alleged that, the appellant chose to declare JET A l for  home  consumption out of the available options such as, for export etc. With this, they zeroed in in "goods for export" hence their import into application of section 34 (1) of the EACCMA.  For clarity, we reproduce the said section as hereunder:

- 34 (1)  Save as otherwise provided in the customs laws, the  whoie of the cargo of an aircraft,  vehicle or vessel which is unloaded  or  to be unloaded  shall  be entered  by the owner within twenty-one days after the commencement of discharge or in the case of

vehicles on arrival  or  such further  period  as may  be allowed  by the  proper officer either for-

- (a) Home consumption.
- (b) Warehousing.
- (c) Transshipment
- (d) Transit or
- (e) Export  processing zones.

Our interpretation of the quoted section above is that, unless what is in the aircraft, vehicle or vessel is a cargo, it cannot be anything other than for home  consumption making the quoted section inapplicable. We interpreted so as in the instant tax dispute, JET A1 fueled  in  international aircraft is not a cargo for it was not loaded or meant to be unloaded in those aircrafts.  Having  ruled out on the import of section 34 of the  EACCMA, we now turn to the crux of the matter, that is whether the declared JET A1 does not attract RDL.

The  appellant  averment  on  this  is  that,  the  respondent  wrongly subjected JET A1 to RDL basing on the declaration made that it is for home consumption.  His stance hinges on two aspects: one that, the consignment was  declared  for  home  consumption  because  that  was  the  only  feasible mechanism for the imported JET A1 and two, that the JET A1 imported and sold to international aircrafts was not consumed in Mainland Tanzania hence, it wasn't meant for free circulation.

Beginning with the declaration of goods for home consumption, parties are at one, and we also observed so that, JET A1 was declared for home consumption. Section  20A of the Railways Act is clear that such goods are RDL taxable. The TRAB at page 547 of the record had this observation in the following words:

The general perception of this provision is that in order for goods to be charged RDL, one condition becomes apparent That is the goods must be entered for home consumption. However, the term good entered  for  home consumption is not explicitly defined in  the Railways Act,  Cap.  170.  But the meaning of the said term is described under the East  African Community Customs Management Act (EACCM) 2004 which was referred  by  section 20A of  the Railways  Act. Section 2 (2) of EACCM,  2004 provides that .. With  this provision,  it is

cogent that any imported  goods declared for use of  Mainland Tanzania , shall be for home consumption and chargeable for RDL,

That being the position of the TRAT,  our observation  is that,  it is a correct  interpretation  and  we  do  not  have  sounding  reasons  to  question otherwise. We are  saying  so  because  the  appellant declared  JET A1  for home consumption thus complying with the dictates of section 20A (2)(b) of the  Railways Act. With  respect,  we  do  not find  the  appellant's  counsel's explanation plausible as he intimated in his written submissions that he was forced  to  declare  JET  A1  for  home  consumption  out of the  available tax declarations mechanisms because the Tanzania Customs Integration System (TANCIS) was not configured to charge RDL. We found this wanting. The appellant made a choice out of available options, as such, he is estopped to decline.  TANCIS is a system and RDL is chargeable by operation of the law, it is inconceivable to hold that the appellant was forced to declare JET A1 for home consumption while in  his mind the intention was for something else. This is an afterthought.  Since we ruled out that JET A1  was not cargo for export  purposes,  then  we  hold  such  a  consignment  to  be  for  home consumption. The reason would be that the appellant did not submit what

was the consignment for if not for taxation purposes on what was declared. We hold so because the appellant simply alleged that the mode "for home consumption" was deployed for that was the only suitable way of declaring goods for tax purposes. We find this to be a  narrow approach of the way facts are comprehended.  This therefore resolves ground one of the appeal which we find unmerited.

Regarding the second component of the appeal that JET A l imported and sold to international aircrafts was not consumed in Mainland Tanzania hence not for free circulation,  again the approach taken  by the appellant's counsel is narrow. As orally submitted by Mr. Masanyiwa and also as per the written submissions of the respondent, JET A l was for free circulation and consumed locally. In our considered view, the fact that JET A l was pumped to international aircrafts thus consumed  in international airspace,  meaning that  it  was  consumed  outside  the  Tanzanian  airspace,  in  itself  does  not connote  that  such  fuel  was  for  export. If  we  go  by  the  appellant's interpretation that fuel consumed by international aircrafts in Tanzania is not for  home  consumption  so  as to  attract  RDL,  then,  JET A l  would  not  be subjected to tax. We have this observation because; one, the appellant has not stated besides RDL which tax the consignment was subjected to. Two,

JET A1 will not be the subject of RDL or any tax in the international airspace the plane is flying or even at the international destination. Three, reasons for not choosing other available tax declaration options are not apparent on the  record. Four, as  international  aircrafts  commencing  their journey  in Tanzania  Mailand  normally fuel  before commencement of the international trips,  it is obvious that fuel  pumped  into them would  be those declared for home consumption, no more no less.

For the foregoing, we are in all fours with Mr. Masanyiwa's contention that the appellant declared JET A1 for home consumption and that is what he meant, the reason why  it  was  pumped in international aircrafts commencing their journey in Mainland Tanzania.

We are now turning to the import of "the Convention" regarding the definition of goods declared for free circulation. In his written submissions, the  appellant  implored  us  to  consider  the  meaning  of  goods  for  home consumption  within  the  dictates  of "the  Convention."  In  his  view,  goods entered for home consumption must be for free circulation in partner states. We understood  him that, as the TRAB and TRAT deployed section 2(2) of EACCMA, then the section  should  not apply because international aircrafts

fuelled  in  Mailand Tanzania  have their destinations outside  member states to the East African Community.  It was in that understanding he urged as to deem JET A1 to have not entered in free circulation in Tanzania and therefore not for home consumption in terms of "the Convention" definition of goods in free circulation. This proposition was resisted by the respondent.  Let the section speak by itself as hereunder:

## 2(2) For  purposes of  this  Act,

(b) goods shall be deemed to be entered for home  consumption  when  they  have  been declared for use in a partner state other than temporary usef and  the  provisions of  paragraph (a) have been fulfilled, [emphasis supplied]

In our view, the respondent is right.  It is conceived so because section 2 (2) of the EACCMA on goods deemed to be entered is expressly clear and the need to borrow a leaf from "the Convention" definition suggested by the appellant's  counsel  is  uncalled  for  as  there  is  no  lacuna.  The  appellant imported JET Al; declared it for home consumption;  is therefore estopped to say otherwise.  It was consumed in Mailand Tanzania, a partner state to

EAC  by  fuelling in international  aircrafts  commencing  their  journey  in Tanzania  Mainland, as such,  it was harmless for the respondent to subject that  consignment  to  RDL  under  section  20A  of  the  Railways  Act.  This therefore  answers  grounds  two  and  three  of  the  appeal.  They  are  thus dismissed forthwith.  In all therefore we find the appeal is devoid of merits and we accordingly dismiss it with costs.
