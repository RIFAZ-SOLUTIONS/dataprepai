## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

31st May 817 t h   September, 2023

## KIHWELO. J.A.:

This appeal arose from the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 28.09.2021 in Tax Appeal No. 35 of 2020 which  upheld  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the Board)  that  found  the  Commissioner  General  (the  respondent)  was justified  in  imposing the assessed taxes.  Disgruntled  by the impugned decision the appellant has approached this Court by way of an appeal.

The abridged  background facts which  led to this appeal  may be appropriately  described  as  follows;  The  appellant  is  a  limited  liability company  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  Tanzania  as  a  branch  of Aggreko International Projects Limited (AIPL), a company registered in and  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  a  regional  hub  in  Jebel  Ali, Dubai. Its principal business is generation of  emergence power (electricity)  and  its  main  customer  in  Tanzania  is  Tanzania  National Electricity Supply Company (TANESCO).

Central  to the appeal  before  us  is the dispute whose genesis  is the comprehensive tax audit exercise into the tax affairs of the appellant for  the  years  of  income  2011-2012  which  covered  various  taxes including corporate tax.  Essentially, the respondent found out that, the appellant  disallowed  management costs  attributed  to  the  appellant's regional hub in Dubai and also the appellant claimed full year wear and tear allowance on assets which were used for less than twelve months.

Conversely, the appellant responded by indicating how head office costs are allocated to the appellant relying on head office allocation of transfer pricing, while indicating that depreciation costs are claimed in relation to the number of days in one's year of income, according to the Income Tax Act,  Cap.  332  (the  Act).  On  30.06.2015  the  respondent

issued a notice of adjusted assessment of corporate income tax for the years of income 2011-2012 which was subsequently objected to by the appellant on 29.07.2015 in terms of section  12  (1) and (4) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap. 408 R.E. 2002 (the TRAA).

An attempt was made to settle the matter amicably whereby there were several exchange of correspondences between the appellant and the  respondent as well  as  series of meetings which  however,  did  not bear any fruits and finally, the respondent made final determination.

The appellant,  unamused by the respondent's decision,  knocked the door of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) challenging it. Upon full determination, the Board in its findings unanimously found the appellant's appeal to be devoid of merit and therefore dismissed it. The Board  further  ordered  the  appellant  to  pay  the  assessed  taxes  in accordance with the law.

Aggrieved,  the  appellant  lodged  the  appeal  before  the Tribunal seeking to reverse the decision of the Board. Upon hearing the parties, the  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeal  in  its  entirety  which  triggered  the instant appeal before the Court.

The  appellant  presently  seeks  to  impugn  the  decision  of  the Tribunal upon a Memorandum of Appeal which goes thus;

- 1. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred  in law in holding that the Board correctly  applied  section 11 (2) o f  the  Income Tax  Act, 2004 in determining the correctness o f allocation o f head office costs to the Appellant;
- 2. The  Tax  Revenue Appeals  Tribunal  erred  in  iaw  in  failing  to consider  section 33(1) o f  the Income Tax  Act, 2004 and the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 2010 in determining the correctness of  the Respondent's decision to disallow head office costs;
- 3. The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in  iaw in misdirecting itse lf  on the evidence on records and  hold that the appellant failed to prove that the costs were actually incurred by the appellant;
- 4. The  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  erred  in  law  by  wrongly interpreting  section  17 (1)  o f the  Income  Tax Act,  2004  and paragraph 3 of the third schedule to the Income  Tax Act,  2004 and  hold that the respondent correctly computed  capital allowance on depreciation; and
- 5. The Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred  in iaw  in holding that the imposition o f  penalty and interest by the respondent was correct in law.

When the matter was placed before us for hearing on 31.05.2023 the appellant enjoyed the services of Mr. Alan Nlawi Kileo who teamed up  with  Mr.  Norbert  Mwaifwani,  both  learned  counsel  whereas  Ms.

Consolata  Andrew,  Principal  State  Attorney  assisted  by  Mr.  Hospis Maswanyia,  Senior  State  Attorney  stood  for  the  respondent. Both parties lodged written submissions in compliance with rule 106 (1) and sub-rule (8) of the Tanzania  Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009,  (the  Rules) which  they,  respectively,  fully  adopted  during  the  hearing,  either  in support or in opposition to the appeal.

Mr.  Kileo prefaced his submission by arguing grounds  1, 2 and 3 conjointly then grounds 4 and 5 separately. We propose to consider the arguments later on in that order.

Arguing in support of the first set of grounds of appeal  Mr.  Kileo contended that, the Tribunal erred when it failed to consider section 33 (1) of the Act as well as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD)  Transfer  Pricing  Guidelines  for  Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations,  2010 (the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines) in determining the correctness of the respondent's decision to disallow head office costs. The learned counsel further argued that, the Tribunal erred in holding that the Board correctly applied section 11 (2) of the Act. He further argued that the main challenge in this appeal is the findings of both the Board and the Tribunal that the dispute was on disallowance of head office costs incurred by AIPL in terms of section

11 (2) of the Act and not on transfer pricing under section 33 (1) of the Act.  He also challenged the Tribunal for agreeing with the  respondent that the allocation  of costs by AIPL to the appellant was  not at arm's length  which  was  contradictory  because  the  requirements  of  arm's length allocation of costs is applicable under section 33  (1) of the Act and  not  section  11  (2)  of the  Act  and  further  to  that,  the  cost  plus method which the Tribunal applied as a basis of disallowance instead of the  turnover  method  applied  by  the  appellant  is  not  indicated  under section 11 (2) of the Act but rather is one of the transfer pricing method used to test arm's length  pricing of transaction  between associates in terms of paragraph 2.45 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

Mr.  Kileo  further  argued  at  considerable  length  that,  it  was  a misconception to consider that the allocation of costs did not meet the criteria  under  section  11  (2)  of the  Act  while  allocation  of costs  in  a transaction  between  associates  is  specifically governed  by  section  33 (1) of the Act which  has specific criteria to determine compliance with arm's length and that in an effort to prove compliance with section 33 (1) of the Act the appellant produced two studies exhibit A-3 which were conducted  under the  OECD Transfer  Pricing  Guidelines  and  came  up with the findings that the head office costs charged to the appellant was

at arm's length. Thus, in his view the appellant discharged its burden of proof while the  respondent did  not discharge its  burden  of proof and bearing in mind that the respondent did not conduct any transfer pricing study to show that services were not rendered. Reliance was placed in our earlier unreported decision in Insignia Limited v. Commissioner General, Civil  Appeal  No.  14  of 2007  for  the  proposition  that  a  tax payer need only give an explanation which appears reasonable in all the circumstances to discharge the onus and the  burden of proof at that point shifts to the tax authority which must satisfy the Court or Tribunal the justification for maintaining the assessment.

Advancing further his support for the appeal, the learned counsel contended  that,  the  respondent  did  not  dispute  the  fact  that  the appellant received services from AIPL and that is why the  respondent imposed  withholding  tax  on  management  fees  and  that  the  only challenge was how to identify or allocate services to a  particular entity amongst the group shared services and in his view the respondent had a problem with transfer pricing methodology which was the basis of its decision and therefore, in his view, it was erroneous for the Tribunal to hold that the Board was right in upholding the respondent's decision on the ground that the appellant failed to  provide evidence to prove that

services were  actually rendered while the basis for issuing the assessments  by  the  respondent  was  not  lack  of  evidence  that  AIPL actually provided services to the appellant.

He faulted the Tribunal for agreeing with the respondent that the basis of disallowance of the costs is that costs allocated to the appellant should have been charged on the cost-plus method and not the turnover method because there is no transfer pricing study or a benchmark study by  the  respondent  to  justify  that  claim  and  also  because  the  direct method is not viable  but rather a direct charging  method  such as the cost-plus  method  is the  most viable  according  to  the  OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. He contended further that, even if it is to be assumed that the appropriate method to be used to allocate costs was the costplus method,  still  it does  not justify total  disallowance of costs as the respondent ought to have established the amount that it considers at arm's length  using the cost-plus method as required  under section  33 (1) of the Act.  He thus,  implored  us to  uphold the first set of grounds of appeal.

The appellant's counsel submitted in support of the fourth ground of appeal that, the appellant correctly calculated the capital allowance based  on  section  17  of the  Act  as  well  as  paragraph  3  of the Third

Schedule to the Act.  Elaborating, Mr. Kileo argued that according to the provisions above, capital allowance is calculated based on the number of days in  a  person's year of income and  that in  2011  the appellant's year of income began in May and therefore, the assets were put to use from May  to December, 2011 and  throughout  2012  wholly  and exclusively in the production of its income. He was of the view that, it was erroneous to calculate capital  allowance  based  on  calendar year whilst the law specifically requires the computation to be based on the number of days in the year of income.

In further submitting in support of the fifth ground of appeal, Mr. Kileo  argued  that,  the  Tribunal  was  wrong  to  find  and  hold  that the respondent was correct to impose interest and penalty to the appellant since the appellant ably demonstrated that the allocation of head office costs was at arm's length and the respondent's computation of capital allowance  was  incorrect,  therefore,  the  imposition  of  penalty  and interest was erroneous. He rounded of by inviting us to decide grounds four and five in favour of the appellant and finally,  he urgued that the appeal be allowed with costs.

In response, Ms. Andrew strongly disagreed with the counsel for the appellant and argued in response to the appeal in a pattern adopted

by  the  appellant.  Essentially,  she  opposed  the  appeal  by  contending that,  the Tribunal did  not fail  to consider the  provisions of section  33 (1)  of  the  Act  and  the  OECD  Transfer  Pricing  Guidelines  but  in  the contrary the Tribunal correctly considered section 33 (1) of the Act and the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines in determining the correctness of the  respondent's  decision  to  disallow  head  office  costs.  The  learned Principal  State  Attorney  went  further  to  submit  that,  although  the appellant submitted at considerable length the applicability of section 33 (1) of the Act, it is quite unfortunate that the appellant is misleading the  Court  since  the  dispute  before  the  Tribunal  was  not  on  transfer pricing  but  rather  the  respondent's  decision  to  disallow  head  office costs.  She  contended  that,  the  Tribunal  even  sought  to  revisit  the evidence on  record and the law specifically sections 33 (1) and  11  (2) of the  Act  and  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the  dispute  was  not  on transfer  pricing  in  terms  of  section  33  (1)  of the  Act  but  rather  on disallowance of head office costs allocated to the appellant for the years of income 2011 and 2012.

In her view, the appellant's submission on transfer pricing studies and  other documents  as  evidence justifying  deduction  of  head  office costs amounted to forcing the dispute to change from disallowance of

head office costs to transfer pricing just because the Tribunal  did  not rule  in  favour  of  the  appellant.  She  further  strongly  disputed  the argument that the appellant submitted studies which were conducted by  an  independent  third  party  indicating  that  the  transaction  was  at arm's  length  and  contended  that the  respondent clearly  informed the appellant that the amount claimed to have been incurred by the regional hub in Dubai and allocated to the relevant entities is not verified by an independent  auditor  a  fact  which  was  not  disputed  by  the  appellant before both the Board and the Tribunal.

In further opposing  the  appeal,  the learned Principal State Attorney, argued that, the Tribunal correctly held that,  for head office costs to be deducted as expenses there has to be compliance with the requirements under section  11  (2) of the Act and that the respondent requested for evidence from the appellant showing payments made to AIPL as management fee for the years of income 2011 and 2012. She contended  that,  the  respondent  further  requested  for  documentary proof to support services rendered to the branch and the corresponding actual cost paid so as to prove the incurrence of such costs to warrant deduction  but  unfortunately  such  proof  was  never  availed  by  the appellant to the respondent and the appellant admittedly and expressly

explained  to  the  respondent  during  the  audit and  the  objection  that, due to the nature of the services provided it was not possible to identify or allocate services to a particular entity.

Illustrating further, the learned Principal State Attorney, expressed her dismay at the appellant's conduct of raising a new dispute that was not even in its grounds of objection and  unfairly condemning the Tribunal that it did  not consider section  33  (1) of the Act and  the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines while deciding that the dispute is on disallowance of head office costs allocated to the appellant for the years of income 2011 and 2012 which were incurred by AIPL in UK with the regional  hub  in  Dubai.  In  her considered  opinion  transfer  pricing  was not an  issue even  before the  Board while deliberating on deductibility of the costs, it addressed the issue on cost allocation not to be at arm's length for lack of transparence for the appellant employed the wrong calculation methods of deductible expenses.

The learned Principal State Attorney went further to submit that, the appellant disagreed with the respondent's bases of disallowance of the costs in that the appellant should have been charged on the basis of cost-plus  method  and  not  on  the  turnover  method  applied  by  the appellant.  She further argued that, the amount claimed to be incurred

by the regional  hub and allocated to relevant entities is not verified by independent auditor and  therefore  the  audited financial  statement of the regional hub was necessary in terms of section  11 (2) of the Act in order  to  determine  the  amounts  which  were  duty  incurred  by  the regional  hub.  She  thus  argued  that,  the  Tribunal  correctly  applied section 11 (2) of the Act in determining the correctness of the allocation of head office costs to the appellant.

Thus, in  her view, the appellant did  not discharge the burden of proof and therefore, the appellant was justified under section 18 (2) (b) of the TRAA to disallow head office costs allocated to the appellant and distinguished the case of Insignia Limited (supra) which was cited by the  appellant  and cited our previous unreported  case  in Shana General  Store  Limited  v.  Commissioner  General,  TRA, Civil Appeal No. 392 of 2020.

In reply to the fourth ground of appeal, the learned Principal State Attorney contended that,  it was erroneous to argue that the appellant correctly calculated capital allowance on the depreciated assets in terms of section  17 of the Act.  Illustrating further, the learned  Principal State Attorney  submitted  that, capital allowance  on depreciated  assets claimed by  the  appellant  was  computed in accordance  with  the

requirements of the Third Schedule to the Act by applying the formula AxBxC/365 in which the term number of days refers to number of days in  which  the  asset  was  put  into  use.  She  argued  further  that,  the appellant's reasoning that the respondent was wrong in re-apportioning capital  allowance  in  2011  year  of  income  based  on  twelve  months instead  of eight  months  was  unfounded.  She firmly  argued  that,  the Tribunal  clearly  and  rightly  explained  the  conditions  for  deduction  of depreciation allowance for depreciated assets in terms of section 17 and paragraph 3 to the Third Schedule to the Act. In her considered opinion 8/12  factor  in  apportioning  the  allowance  as  indicated  in  exhibit  A-8 refers to  a  number of months  in  a year and  not  number of days in  a year as argued by the appellant and therefore, the interpretation under paragraph 3 to the Third Schedule does not give the number of days the asset was put to use but rather number of days in the year of income to which depreciable asset was employed in the production of income, she stressed.

In  her  further  submission,  the  learned  Principal  State  Attorney contended  that,  the  Tribunal  rightly  held  that  the  year  of  income  in terms of section  20 of the Act  means the calendar year or the period approved by the Commissioner General hence, the appellant incorrectly

employed 8/12 factor in calculating capital allowance  while  the respondent rightly applied the formula AxBxC/365 as provided for in the Third  Schedule.  She  rounded  off by submitting that the Tribunal  was correct in law to hold that the respondent was correct in its computation of the capital allowance on depreciable assets as the capital allowance on depreciated assets  is calculated  based  on  the  number of days the depreciable assets was employed by the person wholly and exclusively in  production of the person's year of income.

Arguing in response to the fifth ground of appeal on the issue of interest and penalty, the learned Principal State Attorney was fairly brief and direct to the point,  she contended that, interest and penalty were correctly imposed by the respondent based on the established principles of tax since the appellant could not substantiate the deductibility of the head office direct expenses as required under section  11 (2) of the Act and  the respondent's  computation  of  depreciation allowance  was correct in terms of section 17 and paragraph 3 of the Third Schedule to the Act. In all, she urged the Court to disallow the appeal.

In a brief rejoinder,  Mr.  Kileo reiterated his earlier submission  by arguing that section 33 of the Act comes into play because the appellant is  a  branch  office  of  AIPL  and  that  auditors  confirmed  that  through

exhibit A-3.  He went further to submit that the law does not determine the type of audit but rather the transactions determine the type of audit. On our prompting, Mr. Kileo submitted that, when the dispute arose in 2011-2012 the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines were not applicable by then in Tanzania but there was nothing wrong to follow best practices. He implored us to hold that it was wrong to disallow the whole amount and direct the respondent to re-calculate the amount allowable.

After  a  careful  consideration  of the  entire  record  and  the  rival submissions by the parties there remains only one contentious aspect that  needs  to  be  resolved  and  that  is  whether  or  not  the  Tribunal erroneously decided  the  appeal  before  it  and  therefore  came  to  the wrong conclusion warranting this Court to interfere.

Starting  with  the  first  limb  of  the  three  grounds  of  grievance, which  were ably  argued  by  the  learned  trained  minds  conjointly,  we think  the  central  issue  for  our  determination  is  whether  or  not  the dispute  before the Tribunal  was  not on  transfer  pricing  but  rather on disallowance of head office costs allocated to the appellant. While the appellant has sturdily argued that the Tribunal failed to consider section 33  (1)  of the  Act  and  the  OECD  Guidelines  on  Transfer  Pricing,  the respondent gallantly submitted that the dispute before the  Board  was

not  on  transfer  pricing  and  therefore  the  Board  was  right  in  not considering section 33 (1) of the Act.

Our careful  reading of the record quite obviously contradicts the appellant's submission that the Tribunal erred when it failed to consider section 33 (1) of the Act as well as the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines in determining the correctness of the respondent's decision to disallow head office costs.

While we agree that section 33 (1) of the Act relates to transfer pricing  and  that  the  OECD  Transfer  Pricing  Guidelines  were  relevant despite  the  fact  that  the  Income  Tax  (Transfer  Pricing)  Regulations, 2014  which  were  later  repealed  and  replaced  by  the  Income  Tax (Transfer  Pricing)  Regulations,  2018  were  not  yet  in  place,  we  find considerable  merit  in  the  submission  by  the  learned  Principal  State Attorney that the dispute before the Tribunal was not on transfer pricing in terms of section 33 (1) of the Act but rather on disallowance of head office costs allocated to the appellant for the years of income 2011 and 2012.  The  record  bears  out  clearly that  none  of the  five  grounds  of grievance against the decision of the  respondent as found  at page  11 of the record of appeal specifically faulted the respondent for failure to consider section 33 (1) of the Act.  The five grounds of appeal focused

on the applicability of sections  11,  paragraph  3 of the Third  Schedule and section 98 of the Act.

It  seems  to  us  that,  the  Tribunal  justifiably  found  out that  the appellant failed to prove the total amount claimed to have been incurred by the regional hub in Dubai and allocated to the relevant entities owing to the absence of verification by independent auditors but also bearing in  mind that the appellant admittedly stated that since costs are made up  of  numerous  expenses  it  would  have  been  cumbersome  for  the branch to provide individual invoices for each item.

We find merit in the learned Principal State Attorney's submission that, for head office costs to be deducted as expenses there has to be compliance with the requirements under section 11 (2) of the Act. It is convenient at this stage to excerpt section 11 (2) of the Act so far as it governs calculation of income tax:

' ll- ( 2 ) Subject  to this  Act, for  purposes  of calculating a person's income for a year o f income from  any  business  or  investment,  there  shall  be deducted a ll expenditure incurred during the year o f i ncome,  by the person  wholly and exclusively in the production of income from the business or investm ent"

We have excerpted the above provision which clearly demonstrate the conditions to be met in determining the correctness of the amount to  be deducted  as expenditure  incurred  during the year of income as long  as  the  expenditure  were  incurred  by  that  person  wholly  and exclusively in the production of income from the business or investment. In our view, however, the appellant for an obscure cause did not prove this and therefore, the Board and the Tribunal rightly found out that the evidence was wanting.

In  these  circumstances,  we  are  decidedly of the  view  that,  the appellant did not discharge its burden of proof as required under section 18 (2) (b) of the TRAA.  For, the better understanding of section 18 (2) (b)  of the  TRAA,  we  think,  it  is  desirable  to  reproduce  the  relevant provisions. It reads:

"18-(2y&gt; In every  proceeding before the Board and before the Tribunal-

- (a) N/A
- (b) the onus o f  proving that the assessment or decision in respect  o f  which an appeal  is  preferred  is  excessi  ve or erroneous shaii  be on the appellant"

Adverting  next to the fourth ground of appeal, in our considered view, the narrow,  but important issue at the core of this ground,  and on which its outcome depends, principally turns on a proper construction of section  17 and para 3 of the third schedule to the Act. We think  in  an  attempt  to  answer this  question,  we  should  start  by reflection of the provisions of section 17 and para 3 of the third schedule to the Act, which reads:

## Section 17 of the Act

"17-  For  the  purposes  o f  calculating  a  person's income for a year o f income from any business, there shall be deducted in respect o f  depreciation o f depreciable  assets  owned  and  employed  by  the person during the  year  o f  income wholly  and exclusively in the production o f the person's income from the business the allowances granted under the Third Schedule."

## Paragraph 3 of the third schedule

"3-(l) Subject to this paragraph, an allowance shall be granted to a person for a year o f income for each o f  the person's pools o f depreciable assets equal to the depreciation for the year o f  income of each pool calculated in accordance with subparagraphs (2). (7) or (8) o f  this  paragraph.

(2) Depreciation for a year o f income for each o f  a person's  poofs  o f the  depreciabie  assets  shall  be caicuiated-

(a) in the case o f Class 1, 2 and 3 pools,  according to the diminishing value method; and

(b) in the case o f Class 5f  6 and 7 pools,  according to the straight using the following formula:

## A x  B x  C/365

## Where-

A is the depreciation basis o f the pooi at the end of  the year income;

B is the depreciation rate applicable to  the pool; and

C is the number o f days in  the person's year of income."

Section 20 of the Act provides:

"20.  -(1) Subject to the provisions o f  this section; the year o f  income for every  person shall  be the calendar year.

(2) Subject  to the  provisions o f  subsections (6)f (7) and  (8),  an  entity  may  apply) in writing  to  the Commissioner to change the entity's year o f  income from-

(a) the calendar year; or

(b) a tweive-month period  previously approved by the Commissioner under subsection (3),  to another tweive-month period."

On a close and combined reading of the above provisions on the available fact, with respect, it would appear to us that the Tribunal was right  to find and hold  that in apportioning capital allowance  on depreciated assets the factor to  be considered  is the  number of days the  depreciable  assets  was  employed  by  the person wholly  and exclusively in  production  of the  person's year of income. To conclude the fourth ground of appeal must fail.

We will  next move to the fifth ground of appeal on the complaint that the Tribunal was wrong to find and hold that the respondent was correct to impose penalty to the appellant.  Parties locked horns on the propriety  or  otherwise  of  subjecting  the  appellant  to  pay  penalty.  It bears reaffirming that the Income Tax Act, 2004 particularly section 98 which has since been repealed by Act No.  10 of 2015, imposed interest and penalty for failure to maintain documents or file statement or return of income. In the case at hand, as observed by both the Board and the Tribunal  the  appellant  could  not  substantiate  the  deductibility  of the head  office  direct  expenses  and  the  respondent's  computation  of

depreciation  allowance  was  correct  in  terms  of  the  law  therefore imposing  penalty was inevitable.  We therefore, find  no good cause to interfere  with  the  findings  of  the  Tribunal  in  as  far  as  imposition  of penalty is concerned. That said, this ground of appeal too has no merit and therefore it stands dismissed.

In  view of the  foregoing  position,  we find  no  reasons for  us to interfere  with  the  decision  of the  Tribunal  which  is  hereby  affirmed. Consequently, we dismiss the appeal in its entirety with costs.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 6th  day of September, 2023.
