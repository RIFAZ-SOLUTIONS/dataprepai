## RULING OF THE COURT

28th  April, &amp; 11th August, 2023

## SEHEL. J.A

The applicant, Jovet Tanzania  Limited,  is  inviting  this  Court to  review its  decision  in  Civil  Appeal  No.  217  of  2021  that  dismissed  the  applicant's appeal with costs. The application is made under the provisions of section 4 (4) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, Cap.  141  (the AJA) and  Rule 66 (1) (a) and  (b)  of the  Tanzania  Court  of Appeal  of  Rules,  2009  as  amended  (the Rules) and  it is supported  by  an  affidavit  of  Braysoni  Shayo, learned i advocate  of the  applicant  from  BRASS  Attorneys.  On  the  other  hand,  the respondent  resisted  the  motion  by filing  an  affidavit  in  reply  duly sworn  by Hospis Maswanyia, the respondent's legal counsel.

Briefly, the facts  relevant to the present application are such that; the applicant, a sole agent of Bavaria was licenced to import and supply Bavaria beverages  (the  goods)  in  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania.  Between  the month of September and November, 2014, the applicant imported the goods and  stored  at  the  bonded  warehouse  no.  570  (the  bonded  warehouse) pending  payment  of  assessed  duties  and  taxes.  That  bonded  warehouse belonged  to  Modern  Holding  (EA)  Ltd.  On  2n d   May,  2015  Modern  Holding (EA)  Ltd  wrote  a  letter  to  the  respondent  seeking  for  an  extension  to warehouse  the goods  which was  granted  through  TANSAD Reference Number  TZDL  -   14  -   1135887.  Since  the  goods  were  stored  for  a  long period of time, they started to develop flakes.  Hence, the applicant wrote a letter to Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority and Kinondoni Municipal Council requesting  inspection  of  the  goods  for  destruction.  After  few  days,  the respondent  reminded  the applicant to  pay the  assessed  custom  duties  and taxes of the goods.  Having  received the reminder letter, the applicant wrote a letter to the respondent seeking permission to declare the goods

abandoned as per section 56 of  the East Africa Community  Custom Management Act  (EACCMA) so that they  may  be  destroyed  and  thereafter the applicant could  apply for remission of the custom duties and taxes. The respondent declined to allow abandonment on account that the goods were examined  and  complied  with  all  requirements  before  they  were  cleared  to the  bonded  warehouse thus  import duties and  taxes  had  become  payable. Accordingly,  the  respondent  required  the  applicant  to  pay  the  assessed custom duties and taxes.

Dissatisfied, the applicant unsuccessfully appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  and  to  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal). Following  the  dismissal  of its  appeal,  the  applicant  appealed  to the Court on the following three grounds of appeal:

- "1. The  Board erred in  law to  hold that  the  applicant's abandonment o f goods without permission o f the respondent was not valued and is not supported by the l aw.
- 2. The Tribunal erred in law by  holding that no abandonment o f the goods and remission  o f duties and taxes by operation o f the law for goods overstayed in the bonded  warehouse  if  the  goods  are  not  commercially viable.

## 3.  The Tribunal erred in law by holding that,  the appellant was liable to pay taxes and duties on the goods in dispute as they were not abandoned."

After  hearing  the  submission  of  the  counsel  for  the  parties  on  the three  grounds  of  appeal,  the  Court  observed  that  the  parties  were  at variance on whether the goods were abandoned and then  determined each and every ground of appeal.

On  the  first  ground  of  appeal,  the  Court  revisited  the  provisions  of sections 56 and  16 (3) of the EACCMA as well as Regulation  143 of the East African Community Customs Management Regulations, 2010 (the Regulations)  and  observed that the Commissioner has discretionary  powers to  permit  abandonment  of warehouse  goods,  However,  the  Commissioner may impose conditions  on  the  permit  for the  abandonment  of goods.  The Court further observed that the Commissioner  refused the applicant's application  for  abandonment  vide  a  letter  dated  5th   January,  2016.  At  the end,  it  held  that  the  applicant  did  not  apply  and  get  the  Commissioner's permission  to  abandon  the  goods  and  the  cited  provisions  of  law  do  not suggest  that  there  was  abandonment  of  goods  by  operation  of  law  or voluntarily by the owner.

It  is  pertinent to  point  out  here  that the  applicant  also  contended  in this ground of appeal that the refusal by the Commissioner to re-warehouse the goods, in terms of section 57 of the EACCMA, the goods were treated as abandoned. Having  revisited the provision of section 57 of the EACCMA, the Court concurred  with  the Tribunal  that such  provision  of the  law  relates to sale by public auction of the commercially viable goods which have not been re-warehoused  and  the  distribution  of the  proceeds  of the  sale whereas  in the applicant's case the goods were not commercially viable. At the end, the Court dismissed this ground of appeal.

In  respect to  the  second  ground  of appeal,  the  Court found  that the complaint  was  based  on  facts  while  section  25  (2)  of  the  Tax  Revenue Appeal Act, Cap. 408 (the Act) confers appellate jurisdiction to the Court on matters  involving  questions of law  only.  Despite  making  such  observation, the  Court  went  further  to  consider  the  ground  and  concurred  with  the concurrent  findings of  the two lower  tribunals that although  the law empowers  the  Commissioner  to  permit  abandonment  of  goods  subject  to conditions as may be imposed by the Commissioner and since the Commissioner  refused  the  applicant's  request  to  treat  the  re-warehoused goods as abandoned, there was no abandonment of goods.

For the third ground of appeal, the Court concurred with the Tribunal that the applicant was liable to pay taxes and duties as the goods were not abandoned.

Still  not satisfied with the outcome of its appeal, the applicant has now approached  the  Court  again  by  way of  review  on  two  grounds. One, the decision of the Court was  based on  errors of law on the face of the  record resulting into miscarriage of justice to the applicant. Two, the applicant was wrongly deprived  an opportunity to  be  heard  before the Court when  it held that  the  applicant's  second  ground  of  appeal  raises  pure  factual  matters which the Court had  no jurisdiction to entertain.  After filing the application, the applicant filed the written arguments as required  by Rule  106 (1) of the Rules. Similarly,  the respondent  filed  the reply  submissions  as  per  the provisions of Rule 106 (7) of the Rules.

On the date when the application was called on for hearing,  Mr.  Braysoni Shayo,  learned  advocate  appeared  for  the  applicant,  whereas,  Mr.  Hospis Maswanyia, learned Senior State Attorney appeared for the respondent.

Upon  taking  the  floor,  Mr. Shayo  adopted  the  notice  of  motion,  the supporting affidavit and written arguments.  He then  highlighted the alleged

errors apparent on the face of the judgment of the Court by referring  us to several pages of the Court's decision.

First, he referred  us to page  11 of the judgment and contended that the Court  picked  a  wrong  issue  when  it  said  that "the  crucial  issue  for  our determination is  whether goods under consideration  were abandoned." He submitted that the parties were  not disputing on the  issue of abandonment but rather they were wrangling  on  payment of custom  duties and taxes for abandoned goods and it was for that reason,  he said, no witness was called by  either  party  to  testify  on  points  of  facts.  He  contended  that  the  issue which  the  parties  were  at  variance  before  the  Board  was  on  payment  of custom duties and taxes for abandoned goods as correctly reflected at page 4 of the judgment of the Court. He added that if the Court had considered the  full  legal  effect  of  the  letter  dated  5th   January,  2016  it  could  have discovered  that the  condition  imposed  by that  letter for the  respondent to accept the  abandonment  of the  goods  was  illegal  and  the  refusal  had  no legal effect.

Secondly, he  referred  us  to  page  18  of the judgment  and  contended that  the  Court  erred  in  law  when  it  held  that  the  issue  argued  by  the applicant in the appeal  was  new  issue  not  raised  before the  Board  while  it 7

was the  same  issue.  He  pointed  out  that  the  issue  before  the  Board  was whether the applicant was  liable to  pay custom duties and taxes in  respect of abandoned  goods  and  the  issue  before  the  Court was  whether there  is any  law which  empowers the  Commissioner to charge  duties and  taxes  on goods that are still in the customs control. To him, these issues are one and the same because, he said, the liability of the applicant to pay custom duties and  taxes  in  respect  of  abandoned  goods  which  were  still  in  the  bonded warehouse  is  the  same  thing  as  to  ask  whether  the  respondent  has  legal power to levy or charge custom  duties and taxes on the goods which were destroyed while still in the customs control (bonded warehouse).

Lastly, on the alleged apparent error,  Mr. Shayo adverted  us to page 19 of the judgment where the Court held  that the  applicant was  liable  to  pay custom duties and taxes.  He profusely argued that the holding is against the express statutory provisions of the law which bars the respondent to impose taxes  for  goods  which  are  still under  customs  control,  that  is,  not  yet crossed  the  custom  frontiers.  In  reliance  to  his  submission,  he  cited  to  us the provisions of sections 56 and  57 of the EACCMA, sections 47 and 48 of the Customs (Management of Tariff) Act, Cap. 403 and item  5.8.2 (a) of the

EAC  Customs  Valuations  Manual  -   A  Guide  to  the  Customs  Valuation  of Imported Goods in the East African Community.

On  the ground  that the  applicant was  deprived  of an  opportunity to  be heard,  Mr.  Shayo  referred  us to  page  16 of the judgment where the  Court said that in terms of section 25  (2) of the Act,  it had  no jurisdiction to hear and  determine  grounds  raising  pure  factual  matters.  The  learned  counsel argued that the issue whether the second ground of appeal  raised factual or point law was raised  by the Court, suo moto, while composing a judgment. He added that the record  is clear that the Court did  not give an opportunity to the parties to address it on that issue.

With  the  above  submission,  Mr.  Shayo  urged  the  Court  to  allow  the application with costs.

In  his reply submission,  Mr.  Maswanyia adopted the affidavit in reply and written  arguments  in  opposition  of the  application.  He  informed  the  Court that  he  will  make  the  reply  submission  in  the  same  manner  submitted  by counsel for the applicant.

Responding  to  the  argument that  the  Court  picked  a  wrong  issue,  the learned Senior State Attorney argued that the issue whether the goods were

abandoned or not was central  before the  Board, Tribunal and the Court. To cement  his  argument,  he  took  us  through  pages  3,  4,  5  and  7  of  the judgment  where  the  Court  summarized  the  facts  and  issues  which  were before  the  Board  and  the  Tribunal. He  also  referred  us  to  the  first  and second  grounds of appeal  which  were  raised  and  argued  before  the  Court during the hearing of the appeal.

Responding  to the argument that the  issue  before the  Board  and the Court was one  and  the same,  the  learned  Senior  State Attorney supported the  observation  made  by  the  Court.  He  contended  that  the  issues  were different as the issue  1 whether the applicant was liable to pay custom duties and taxes in respect o f  the abandoned goods'and  'whether there is any law which  empowers  the  Commissioner to  charge  duties and taxes on goods which are still in the customs control'are covered  under different provisions of  law,  that  is,  sections  56  and  57  of  the  EACCMA  respectively.  It  was therefore his submission that the two issues were not the same.

Responding  to  the  complaint on  the  finding  of the  Court,  the  Senior learned State Attorney argued that the complaint that the Court erroneously interpreted  the  provision  of the  law does  not amount to  an  error apparent on the face of record as it invites the Court to re-hear the arguments already 10

considered by  the Court  on appeal. Nonetheless, he went  further by responding that as the gist of the dispute between the  parties was whether the  goods  were  abandoned  or  not,  the  Court  held  that  the  applicant  was liable  to pay custom  duties  and  taxes  because  the  goods  were  imported while  fit for  human  consumption  and  only  expired  after  the  applicant  had failed to pay the assessed taxes in time.

Lastly,  Mr.  Maswanyia  responded  to  the  complaint  that  the  parties were not accorded the right to be heard on the issue raised by the Court. At the  outset,  the  learned  Senior  State  Attorney  readily  conceded  that  the Court  stated  at  page 16  of  its  judgment  that  it  had no  jurisdiction  to determine  matters  of  fact  in  terms  of  section  25  (2)  of  the  Act,  but  he argued that the statement was an obiter dictum  because,  he  reasoned,  the Court went ahead to determine the second ground of appeal  on  merit as  it can be gathered at page  17 of the judgment. In that respect,  he contended, there was no  right that was abrogated.

At the  end,  the  learned  Senior  State  Attorney  impressed  upon the Court to dismiss the application with costs.

When asked  by the Court,  whether the goods crossed the  border,  he replied that they were still in the bonded warehouse.

Mr. Shayo re-joined that as the learned Senior State Attorney conceded  that  the  goods  did  not  cross  border,  the  Commissioner  had  no authority under the law to impose taxes and duties on goods that have not yet  crossed  the  border  controls.  He  further  contended  that,  if  the  goods were  found  unfit  for  human  consumption,  the  respondent  ought  to  have made  an  order  of  re-  exportation  of  goods  but  not  to  impose  taxes  on uncleared  goods.  He  therefore  reiterated  his  earlier  submission  and  urged the Court to allow the application with costs.

We have carefully examined the grounds raised by the applicant in the notice  of  motion  together  with  the  supporting  affidavit  and  submissions  of both  parties and  noted that the applicant pegged  his application  for review under sub-rule (1) (a) and (b) of rule 66 of the Rules where he alleged that the judgment of this Court dated  30th   March,  2021  was  based  on  manifest error on the face of the record that resulted into a miscarriage of justice and that  the  applicant  was  wrongly  deprived  of  an  opportunity  to  be  heard. Therefore,  the issue  that  stands  for  our  determination is whether  the

grounds  raised  by  the  applicant  fits  perfectly  within  the  ambit  of  review envisaged under the provisions of Rule 66 (1) (a) and (b) of the Rules.

We  shall  start with  the  complaint that  there  is  an  apparent  error  on the  face  of  the  judgment.  Mr.  Shayo  argued  that  since  the  Court  started with  a  wrong  footing  when  it  said,  at  page  11  of  its  judgment,  that  " the crucial issue  for  our  determination  is  whether goods  under  consideration were abandoned"then  that is an  error  apparent on  the  face  of  record.  In essence,  this  complaint  is  not  a  ground  for  review,  so  to  speak.  A  patent, manifest and  self-evident error does not require elaborate submission for it to be established as it was done by Mr. Shayo. In trying to impress upon the Court to find that there was manifest error,  Mr.  Shayo travelled through the record that were  before the  Board,  then  the Tribunal, the  memorandum  of appeal  and  the  letter dated  5th   January,  2016 to  drive  home  his argument that the  issue  before the appeal was not about abandonment of goods but rather  whether  the  applicant  had  to pay  custom  duties  and  taxes  on abandoned goods.

Here, we wish to echo as to what entails manifest error. In the case of Chandrakant Joshubhai  Patel  v.  The  Republic [2004]  T.L.R.  218,  the Court adopted the excerpts from MULLA,  14th  Edition and said that:

"An error apparent on the face o f  the record must be such that can be seen by one who runs and reads,  that is,  an obvious and patent mistake and not something which can be  estabiished by a  long-drawn process o f reasoning on points on which there may conceivably be two opinions.... A mere error o f law is not a ground for review under this rule.   That a decision is erroneous in law is not ground for ordering  review.... It  can  be  said  o f an  error  that  is apparent on the face o f the record when it is obvious and self-evident and does not require an elaborate argument to be established..."

With  the  above  definition,  we find  the complaints  under  grounds  1.2 and 1.3 are misconceived. We therefore dismiss them.

We now turn to the complaint that the Court erred  in holding that the issue before the Court was different from the one raised before the Tribunal. Going  by  the  submission  of Mr.  Shayo,  it  is  dear that  the  applicant  is  not satisfied with the findings of the Court, and that, it now wants us to exercise our  review jurisdiction  to  alter  the  findings  we  made  in  the  appeal.  It  be understood that the purpose of review is to correct errors and not substitute a  view.  With  that  in  mind,  we  are  satisfied  that  we  have  no jurisdiction  to entertain  the  applicant's  invitation  otherwise  we  will  be  sitting  in  appeal

against our own  decision,  which  is  highly  improper.  The  Court emphasized this  point  in  the  case  of Chandrakant  Joshubhai  Patel  v.  Republic (supra) wherein  it referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of India  in the case of Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1964) S.C.  1372 that:

"A  review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an  erroneous decision is reheard and corrected,  but lies only for  patent errors."

Ground  1.7 also fails.

In the  same  vein,  the  complaint  that  the  Court  condemned  the applicant to  pay custom  duties and  taxes for the goods which  were  still  in the  bonded  warehouse  amounts  to  dissatisfaction  of the  Court's  decision. The issue as to whether the goods were abandoned or not was raised in the appeal,  heard  and thoroughly determined  by the Court.  To  bring  again the same complaint in the application for review is a total  misconception of the underlying  principle governing  review.  The  primary  purpose  of review is to address irregularities of a decision which has caused injustice to a party and not the  merits of a  decision.  We  are therefore  satisfied  that,  grounds  1.1, 1.4,1.5 and  1.8 are baseless.

Lastly,  we turn to the complaint that the applicant was denied a  right to  be  heard  on  the  issue  raised  by  the  Court  when  it  was  composing  the judgment  without  giving  parties  a  right  to  address  it  on  that  issue.  Mr. Shayo  contended  that  the  Court  declared  the  second  ground  of  appeal raised factual  issues which it had  no jurisdiction  but parties were not invited to address it. We  need  not be detained  much on this because the record  is clear that after  having  stated that in terms of section  25  (2) of the Act, the Court had  no jurisdiction to entertain ground  raising  pure factual  matters it went further to determine it. This is clearly reflected in the judgment of the Court where at page 16 it said:

"However,  the above position o f the law notwithstanding, we  have  observed  the  following in relation to this complaint,../'

We are therefore firmly of the view that such statement was made by passing. It was an obiter dictum  as the ground was later on fully considered and  determined  by the  Court.  Accordingly,  we find  that grounds  1.8  and  2 are devoid of merit.

At the  end,  we  are  of the  settled  position  that,  the  applicant  in  this application  has  failed  to  sufficiently  demonstrate  before  us  any  justifiable

reason for us to  review our judgment.  Consequently,  we are constrained to dismiss this application with costs.
