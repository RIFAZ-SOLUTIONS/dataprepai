## B. E. K. Mganga, J.

On 23 rd July  2023,  Robert  Mapesi,  the  above-named  applicant  filed this  application  seeking  the  court  to  extend  time  within  which  to  file  a notice  of  appeal  against  the  judgment  and  decree  of  this  court  (Hon. S.A.N. Wambura, J) dated 04 th June 2020.

When the application was called on for hearing, Mr. Makaki Masatu, Advocate  for  the  applicant  appeared  and  argued  for  the  applicant  that, after delivery of the said judgment and being aggrieved, 03 rd August 2020 applicant  filed  Civil  Application  No.  310/18  of  2020  before  the  Court  of

Appeal  for  revision.  Counsel  for  the  applicant  submitted  further  that,  on 04 th July 2023, the Court of Appeal struck out the said revision on ground that applicant ought to have filed an appeal and not revision. He went on that, on 14 th July 2023 applicant was served with the Court of Appeal order and that on 18 th July 2023, four days after being served with the Court of Appeal  order,  applicant  filed  this  application  in  the  e-filing  system.  Mr. Masatu submitted further that; applicant has accounted the delay including the period from 04 th July 2023 to the date of filing this application. During submissions,  learned  counsel  for  the  applicant  conceded  that,  applicant has  not  attached  the  printout  to  show  that  this  application  was  filed electronically on 18 th July 2023.

Counsel for the applicant submitted further that, in an application of this nature, applicant is required to account for the delay as it was held in the case of Lyamuya  Construction  Company  Ltd  v.  Board  of Registered  Trustee  of  Young  Women's  Christian  Association  of Tanzania ,  Civil  Application  No.  2  of  2010,  CAT  (unreported)  and  added that  applicant  has  accounted  for  the  delay.    He  submitted  further  that, section  21  of  the  Law  of  Limitation  Act  excludes  time  the  party  spent  in Court  and  cited  the  case  of Patrick  Magologozi  Mongella  V.  The Board of Trustees of the Public Service Social Security Fund , Misc. Labour  Application  No.  186  of  2022,  HC  (unreported)  to  support  his

submissions. Counsel for the applicant added that, applicant was diligent in prosecuting the matter before the Court of Appeal.

Counsel  for  the  applicant  also  submitted  that,  applicant  filed  and withdraw the notice of appeal on ground that his grievance was on facts only. He argued that, applicant relied on the Court of Appeal's decision in the case of Muhimbili National Hospital v. Constantine Victor ,  Civil Application  No.  44  of  2013.    He  went  on  that,  in  the  case  of Patrick Magologozi  Mongella v. The  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Public Service  Social  Security  Fund ,  Civil  Application  No.  342  of  2022,  CAT (unreported), the The Court of Appeal changed the earlier position set in Muhimbili National Hospital's  case  (supra) and  now a  person  can appeal  against  both  facts  and  law.  Learned  counsel  for  the  applicant concluded his submissions praying the court to grant the application.

On  the  other hand,  Jacqueline Chunga,  Senior  State Attorney resisted  the  application  submitting  that,  on  4 th June  2020  this  court dismissed revision No. 813 of 2018 that was filed by the applicant. Senior State  Attorney  submitted  further  that,  on  17 th June  2020,  applicant  filed the notice of appeal but withdraw it on 23 rd July 2020. She added that, on 03 rd August 2020, applicant filed Revision application No. 310/18 0f 2020 before the Court of Appeal but the same was struck out on 04 th July 2023.

Learned State Attorney submitted further that, applicant filed this application on 25 th July 2023 after 3 years and one month from the date this court dismissed revision No. 813 of 2018. She submitted further that, applicant  has  filed  this  application  in  abuse  of  Court  process  because  he filed  a  notice  of  appeal  which  he  withdrew  and  thereafter  filed  Revision that was struck out by the Court of Appeal. To bolster her submissions that applicant has filed this application in abuse of court process, Senior State Attorney  referred  this  Court  to  the  case  of Eredina  William  Swai  v. Andrea Nehemia Swai &amp; Another , Probate Appeal No. 17 of 2019, HC (unreported). She however, during submissions, conceded that there is no paragraph  in the counter affidavit showing  that applicant filed this application in abuse of Court process.

Ms.  Chunga  submitted  further  that,  applicant  was  supposed  to account for each day of delay and cited the case of Finca (T) Limited &amp; Another v. Boniface Mwalukisa , Civil Application No. 589/12/ of 2018, CAT  (unreported)  to  support  her  submissions.  she  added  that,  applicant has not accounted for the delay from 14 th July 2023 to 18 th July 2023. She submitted further that, both Constantine's case (supra) and Magologozi's case (supra) are not applicable in the application at hand because applicant was supposed to choose a proper route. She added that,

applicant  was  duly  represented  by  an  advocate  and  that,  applicant's advocate  was  negligent.    Senior  State  Attorney  submitted  further  that, negligence of an Advocate is not a ground for extension of time and cited the  case  of Salome  Kahamba  v.  Siril  Augustine  Mallya ,  Misc.  Civil Application No. 557 of 2021, CAT (unreported) to support her submissions. During  submissions,  Senior  State  Attorney  conceded  that,  in  the  counter affidavit, respondent did not state that applicant's counsel was negligence hence is submission from the bar that is not evidence.

In further imploring the court to dismiss this application, Senior State Attorney  referred  the  court  to  the  case  of Tanga  Cement  Co.  Ltd  v. Jumanne Masangwa &amp; Another ,  Civil  Application  No.  6  of  2001  CAT (unreported)  that  the  court  should  consider  whether,  applicant  acted promptly  and  whether,  he  gave  explanation  for  the  delay.  Senior  State Attorney was quick to submit that applicant did not act promptly.

Senior  State  Attorney  added  that,  applicant  was  supposed  to  show that there is likelihood of success and cited the case of Rajabu Kidimwa &amp;  Another  V.  Idd  Adam [1991]  TLR  38  to  support  her  submissions. Senior  State  Attorney  concluded  her  submission  praying  the  court  to dismiss this application on ground that applicant has failed to adduce good reasons for the delay.

In  rejoinder,  Mr.  Masatu,  counsel  for  the  applicant  maintained  that applicant has accounted for the delay and that, both Constantine's case (supra) and Magologozi's case (supra) are relevant to this application. He  submitted  further  that,  both Salome's  case (supra)  and Tanga Cement's  case (supra)  are  not  applicable  to  the  application  at  hand because  there  are  no  facts  showing  that  Advocate  of  the  applicant  was negligent or that applicant was not diligent. He added that, in the counter affidavit,  respondent  did  not  state  that  applicant  filed  this  application  in abuse of court process.

I should point out albeit briefly that, submissions by counsel for the applicant  that  applicant  filed  this  application  through  electronic  filing system  on  18 th July  2023  is  not  supported  by  evidence  hence  it  is submissions from the bar that is not evidence hence cannot be acted upon. See  the  case  of Rosemary  Stella  Chambejairo  vs  David  Kitundu Jairo, Civil Reference  6  of  2018)  [2021]  TZCA  442, A.  Nkini  &amp; Associates  Limited  vs  National  Housing  Corporation, Civil  Appeal No.72  of  2015)  [2021]  TZCA  564,  and Shadrack  Balinago  vs  Fikir Mohamed @ Hamza &amp; Others, Civil Application No. 25 of 2019 [2021] TZCA 45 to  mention  just  a  few.  Again,  submissions  by  the  Senior  State Attorney  that  applicant's  counsel  was  negligent,  and  that  applicant  filed

this  application  in  abuse  of  court  process  suffers  the  same  consequence because it is not backed up by evidence on the record.

This  being  an  application  for  extension  of  time,  it  is  upon  the applicant  to  show  good  cause  for  delay  has  it  was  held  in  the  case  of Attorney  General  v  Oysterbay  Villas  Limited  &amp;  Another , Civil Application  No.  299/16  of  2016,  CAT  at  Dar  es  Salaam, Wambura N.J. Waryuba  v.  The  Principal  Secretary  Ministry  for  Finance  and Another ,  Civil  Application  No.  320/01  of  2020.  In Wambura's  case (supra) it was held inter-alia that: -

- '… it is essential to reiterate here that the Court's power for extending time… is  both  wide-ranging  and  discretionary  but  it  is  exercisable  judiciously  upon
- cause being shown.'

In  the  application  at  hand,  it  is  undisputed  that  on  17 th June  2020 applicant  filed  the  Notice  of  Appeal  before  this  court  with  a  view  of challenging the judgment and decree of this court dated 4 th June 2020. It is also undisputed that on 27 th July 2020, he filed the notice to withdraw the said notice of appeal. It is also undisputed that, on 3 rd August 2020, applicant filed an application for Revision No. 310/18 of 2020 before the Court of Appeal and that, on 4 th July  2023,  the  said  Revision  was  struck out  on  ground  that  applicant  should  have  filed  an  appeal  and  not application for revision. There is no contention that all that time, applicant

was in the corridors of the Court of Appeal. That notwithstanding, it is my view that, applicant was indifference of the proper route to take which is why initially filed the notice and later, withdrew it and filed revision. In my view, indifference of the applicant on  the  proper  route  to take in approaching the court cannot be a ground for extension of time.

It was deponed by the applicant that she was supplied with a copy of Ruling of the Court of Appeal striking out Revision Application No. 310/18 of 2020 on 14 th July 2023 and that, the days from 14 th July 2023 to 18 th July  2023,  were  spent  in  preparation  and  filing  this  application.  In  fact, there is no contention on that. The record shows that applicant filed this application  on  25 th July  2023.  As  pointed  hereinabove,  there  is  no  proof that  applicant  filed  this  application  electronically  on  18 th July  2023.  In absence of that  proof,  I  hold  that  applicant  filed  this  application  on  25 th July 2023 and not on 18 th July 2023.

In  the  affidavit  in  support  of  the  application,  applicant  did  not account for the delay of seven (7) days from 18 th July 2023 when he was preparing this application to the date of filing this application on 25 th July 2023.    It  was  correctly  in  my  view,  submitted  by  both  counsel  that applicant  was  supposed  to  account  for  the  delay  as  it  was  held  case  of

Lyamuya Construction Co. Ltd vs Board of Registered Trustee of

## Young Women's Christian Association of Tanzania, Civil  Application

No.  2  of  2010  [2011]  TZCA  4  and Finca  T.  Limited  &amp;  Another  vs Boniface  Mwalukisa (Civil  Application  589  of  2018)  [2019]  TZCA  561 cited by counsel for the applicant and the respondent respectively.  There is  a  plethora  of  case  laws  that,  the  delay  even  of  a  single  day,  must  be accounted  for.  See Mwalukisa's  case (supra), Hyansitha  Malisa  vs John  Malisa (Civil Application  167  of  2021)  [2023]  TZCA  239  and Tanzania Local Government Workers Union (TALGWU) vs Sospeter  Gallus  Omollo (Civil  Application  No.311/18  of  2022)  [2023] TZCA 17486 to mention just a few.

As  pointed  hereinabove,  applicant  did  not  account  for  seven  days from 18 th July 2023 to 25 th July 2023. With that failure, I find that there is no justification for this court to extend time.

For the foregoing and in the up short, I dismiss this application for want of merit.

Dated at Dar es salaam this 27 th September 2023
