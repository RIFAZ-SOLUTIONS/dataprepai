## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

25,n  October, 2021 &amp; 3r d  November, 2021

## MAIGE, J.A.:

Under section  111  (1)  of the  East African  Community Customs Management Act, 2004 (the EACCMA), goods originating from Partner States are accorded preferential tariff treatment in accordance with the Rules of Origin  provided for under the Protocol on the Establishment of the  East African  Customs Union  (the Protocol). The motive behind the Rules of Origin, it would seem to us, is to promote intra-state trade among the Partner States by ensuring that it is only goods originating from the EAC custom territory which enjoy tax relief under the single customs  territory  arrangement.  Tanzania  and  Kenya  are  irrefutably among the Partner States of East African  Community Customs Union (EACCU).

The appellant is a company duly incorporated under the laws of Tanzania dealing with  retail  and wholesale trade.  In the course of its ordinary business, the appellant imported, between January  to December 2012,  assorted  edible  oil  fresh  and  soap  from Pwani  Oil Products  Kenya  Limited,  a  company  based  in  the  Republic  of Kenya ("the  supplier"). It is not  in  dispute  that,  the  supplier  was  the beneficiary  of the  duty  remission  scheme  under  Article  25(1)  of the Protocol  as  per the  Legal  Notice  No.  EAC/45/2011  (exhibit A4).  It is express  under  sub-article  (2)  as  well  as  in  exhibit  A4  that,  finished goods that benefit from  the duty remission  scheme are  intended  for exportation outside the EAC and that, in the event they are sold within EACCU,  the  same  shall  attract  full  duties,  levies  and  other  charges provided in the Common External Tariff.

In  understanding  that,  the  imported  goods  benefited  from  the scheme, the respondent imposed duties to the appellant at the rate of

TZS  855,697,789.00  By  way of review,  the  appellant challenged  the imposition of the tax by the respondent on account that, the imported goods originated from Kenya as per the certificate of origin issued by the  Kenyan  Revenue  Authority  under section  111(2)  of the  EACCMA read together with  rule  12(1) of the  EAC  Rules of Origin  2009 which was applicable by then. The respondent confirmed its decision but only that, it adjusted the quantum of the import duty to TZS 457,855,601.25.

Being  aggrieved,  the  appellant  appealed  to  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  on  the  ground  that,  the  imported  goods were eligible for preferential tariff treatment and that; the decision of the respondent was in violation of the provisions of section  111 of the EACCMA read together with rule 4(1) of the EAC Rules of Origin.  The respondent was blamed in not taking into account that the certificate of origin was a conclusive evidence that, the imported goods originated from Kenya.

In  its  decision  dismissing  the  appeal,  the  Board  was  of  the opinion  that,  as  the  manufacturer  was  a  beneficiary  of  the  duty remission scheme, the importation of goods to Tanzania could not be

duty  free. On  whether  the  certificate  of  origin  was  a  conclusive evidence on the originality of the imported goods, the Board  observed as follows:-

"In no way either can a certificate of  origin be used as a bar to the Respondent from doing its roie of  collecting taxes. After all, the certificate of  origin does not contain a declaration to the effect that  the  goods imported  by the  Appellant were manufactured by materials obtained  from Kenya.  The declaration merely states that the goods  are  of  Kenyan origin having  been produced in Kenya ."

Further aggrieved,  the appellant appealed  to the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) on three grounds. First, that the Board erred in  law and fact in  holding that the certificate of origin does not contain  a  declaration  to  the  effect  that  the  goods  imported  by  the appellant  were  manufactured  using  materials  obtained  from  Kenya. Second, that the  Board  erred  in  law  and  facts  by  holding  that,  the imported goods  were manufactured from materials which were shipped  to  the  East  African  Community  under  the  duty  remission scheme. Third, that the Board erred in  law and fact by holding that

the respondent's  decision  to  enforce  collection  of  the  duties  in question was proper.

The appellant's argument before the Tribunal  in  support of the first  and  third grounds of appeal  was that, the certificate  of origin raised a  rebuttable presumption on the originality of the goods which could only be impeached in exceptional circumstances, through the verification procedure under rule 12(3) of the EAC Rules of Origin.  On the second ground, the contention was that, the Legal Notice  was not sufficient evidence to invalidate the certificate of origin.  On the issue of conclusiveness of the certificate of origin, the Tribunal guided by its previous  decision in Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  vs.  Bright Choice Limited, Tax Appeal No. 38 of 2013 (unreported), was of the opinion that,  since the Rules of Origin intended to regulate importation of goods within the EACMU, it could not be harmonized with the duty remission  scheme  under  the  Protocol.  In  particular,  it  remarked  as follows:-

"We find  no reason to differ with the Tribunal's holding as reproduced  herein above. In fact the Tribunal made it dear that the Rules of Origin and  the  duty  remission  provisions  of  the

Protocol  and  the  EAC  Common  Market Act, 2004 are mutually exclusive because they were intended  to  serve  different  purposes. That answers all the arguments by the appellant's counsel  that  there  was  need  to  carry  out verification exercise

As  to whether  the  legal notice was  sufficient  evidence  to invalidate the certificate of origin, the Tribunal was of the position that, although  the  former  could  not  invalidate  the  latter,  it  constituted sufficient  evidence  to  prove  that  the  seller  of  the  goods  was  the beneficiary of the scheme and therefore,  her goods could not be sold within the EAC territory without paying the relevant duties.  If we can quote, the Tribunal remarked as follows:-

"It is not in dispute in this matter that Pwani Oil Products Limited which supplied the goods to the appellant was listed in the Legal Notice No. EAC/45/2011 as one of  the beneficiaries of the  duty  remission  scheme. The  appellant's counsel  argues  that  that  is  not  sufficient evidence but he does not say why.  The Legal Notice  does  not  in  any  way  invalidate  the certificate  of origin  which  showed  that  the goods originated in  Kenya.  The  Legal Notice

simply showed that the seller of the goods is one of the beneficiaries of the duty remission scheme.  That being the case the goods which were sold to the appellant were not supposed to  be  sold  to  another  country  within  East African  Community customs  territory  without payment of  taxes"

Once  again  aggrieved,  the  appellant  has  preferred  a  second appeal to the Court. In her memorandum of appeal, the appellant has faulted the decision of the Tribunal in holding that, under Article  25(3) of the Protocol, goods sold to the appellant by the supplier are subject to  payment of duty and for failure to carefully consider the provisions of Rule 12(3) of the Rules of Origin.

At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was represented  by Messrs. Wilson  Mukebezi, Alan Kileo and Stephen Axwesso,  learned advocates whereas  Ms. Consolatha Andrew and Juma Kisongo,  leaned Principal  State  Attorneys represented  the  respondent.  In  their  oral submissions which for the appellant was submitted  by Mr.  Axwesso and  for the  respondent  Ms.  Andrew,  each  of the  parties adopted  its written  submissions  earlier  on  filed  with  some  clarifications. We sincerely  appreciate  for  the  counsel's  well  researched  and  focused

submissions. They have been very instrumental  in preparation of our judgment.

In his submissions, Mr. Axwesso faults the Tribunal in not holding that, the appellant was wrongly subjected to payment of duties under Article 25(3) of the Protocol despite the evidence in the certificate of origin  that  the  goods  originated  from  Kenya.  He  submits  that,  in accordance with rule 12 (1) of the Rules of Origin, the certificate of origin  is  a  rebuttable  presumption  that  the  goods  in  question  are produced using raw materials from Kenya. He submits therefore that, upon producing such a certificate, the burden of proof  shifted to the Respondent.  The  counsel placed heavy  reliance  on  the  case  of Insignia  Limited  vs.  Commissioner General  (TRA) Civil  Appeal No. 7 of 2007 (unreported) to the effect that, where the respondent in exercise  of its duty seizes the  documents of a  tax-payer and  makes use of them to compute the tax-payer's VAT liability, the taxpayer is deemed to have made out a prima facie case such that the evidential burden shifts on the respondent.

He submits  further that, since the certificate of origin was issued by  the Kenyan Revenue  Authority  (KRA)  which is a competent

authority,  it  was  conclusive  such  that  it  could  only  be  rebutted  in exceptional  circumstance  and  only  through  a  verification  exercise under rule  12(2) of the Rules of Origin  2009 which was applicable at that juncture. He submits further that,  by  unilaterally  disregarding the certificate of origin, the respondent committed an act of fundamental  breach  of the  EAC  laws which  seek to  harmonize trade among the Partner  States.

In  rebuttal,  it was submitted that,  since  under Article 25 of the Protocol, duty remission scheme is intended to promote exportation of finished goods outside the EAC, mere production of certificate of origin cannot justify selling of such goods within the territory without paying duties.  In the opinion of the counsel for the respondent, the certificate of  origin is relevant  for  other  purposes  and  not  for  determining taxability  of goods  when  sold  within  EAC. It  is  their  case  therefore that, a certificate of origin is not a conclusive evidence on the originality of goods  if the  same  are  covered  under duty  remission  scheme.  For that reason, it is the submission for the respondent that, the authority in Insignia case supra is distinguishable and therefore inapplicable. In the final  result, the Court is urged to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  his rejoinder submission,  Mr.  Axwesso did  not raise any new issue apart from reiterating his submissions in chief.

With  the  above  exposition  of the  nature  of the  controversy,  it may  be  desirable  to  consider  the  merit  or  otherwise  of the  appeal. Parties appear not to be in dispute that the supplier of the goods under discussion is a  beneficiary of the duty remission scheme. They are as well  not at issue  on  the  position  of  law that,  subject to the  rules of origin, goods covered under the scheme cannot enjoy preferential tariff treatment  under  section  111  of the  EACCMA.  The  dispute,  it  would appear,  is  whether  the  certificate  of origin  is  a  conclusive  evidence that,  the  goods  in  question  are  manufactured  using  raw  materials originated from Kenya.

For the appellant, it is submitted, the same is conclusive evidence that, the goods in question originates from Kenya. Reliance was placed on  the  provisions  of  rule  12  (1)  of  the  Rules  of  Origin. For  the respondent, it was submitted that the same is not relevant where the goods are covered by the remission scheme because the rules of origin and the remission scheme are mutually exclusive.

We  propose to  start  by  remarking  that,  whether certificate  of origin  is a  conclusive evidence on the originality of the goods for the purpose of preferential tariff treatments is a question of law and must have its answer founded on law and not mere logical arguments. This being a tax dispute, the burden of proof is, according to section  18(2) (b)  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  [Cap.  408,  R.E.,  2019],  on  the appellant.  Therefore, in Insiginia case (supra) itwasheld:-

## "The burden of proof in tax matters has

often been placed on the  tax-payer. This indicates how critical the burden rule is,  and reflects several competing rationales: the vital interest  of  the  government  in  getting its revenues; the tax  payer has easy access to the relevant  information  and  the  importance  of encouraging  voluntary  compliance  by  giving tax-payers incentives to self-report  and to keep adequate records in case of disputes". [Emphasis added].

It is also the law that, in interpreting tax statutes, the correct approach is  to  apply  the  plain  meaning  rule.  It  is  to  the  effect  that,  when  a provision is in specific language that admits no doubt or ambiguity in its application, it should be applied strictly as it is, without interpolation.

See for instance, Resolute Tanzania Limited vs. The Commissioner  General,  Tanzania Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  125  of  2017  (unreported).  Other  rules  of  interpretation such as mischief rule come in where the words of the statute are not clear or where strict application of the same would lead to an obvious absurdity.  Thus,  in Republic vs.  Mwesige Godfrey and Another, Criminal Appeal  No. 355 of 2014 (unreported)  which was  quoted in Commissioner  General  Tanzania Revenue vs. Aggreko International  Project  Ltd, Civil  Appeal  No.  148  of  2018,  it  was observed as follows:-

"But  this  only  holds  true  in  the  dearest  of cases. Where  there  is  an  obvious  lacuna  or omission and/ or ambiguity the courts have a duty to fill in the gaps or dear the ambiguity".

In accordance with item 2.1 of the Manual on the Application of the East Africa Community Rules of Origin, 2006, EAC Rules of Origin is defined as:-

"a  set  of criteria  that  is  used  to  distinguish between goods that are produced within  the EAC  Customs  territory  and  are  eligible  to community tariff treatment against those

produced outside  the  EAC customs  territory that  attract  import  duties  specified  in the Common externa! tariff."

It  is  also  the  law  under  Rule  4(1)  of the  EAC  Rules  of Origin, 2009  that,  the  mere  fact  that  goods  are  consigned  directly  from  a Partner  State, does  not  qualify  them  to be  classified as  goods originating from the EAC  customs  territory for the purpose  of preferential  tariff treatment. They  have  to  meet  either  of the  two criteria set out in items (a)  and (b). Thus:-

"Goods shall be accepted as originating in  a  Partner State where they are consigned directly from a Partner State to a consignee in another Partner State  and where:

- (a) They have been wholly produced as provided for in Rule 5 of  these Rules; or
- (b) They have been produced  in a Partner State wholly or  partially from materials imported from outside the Partner State or of  undetermined origin by a process of production which affects a substantial transformation such that:
- (i) the c.i.f value of those materials does not exceeds sixty  per centum of  the total  cost  of the materials used in the production of the goods; and

- (ii) the value added resulting from the process of  production accounts for  at  least thirty  five per centum  of the  ex-factory  cost of the goods as specified as specified in the Fifth Schedule to those Rules; and
- (Hi) the goods are classified or become classifiable under  a tariff  heading other than the  tariff heading  under  which  they  were imported as specified in the Second Schedule to these Rules."

The preferential tariff treatment is created under section 111 (1) of the EACCMA according to which goods originating from the Partner States  are  accorded  with  preferential  tariff treatment  in  accordance with the Rules of Origin provided for under the Protocol.  In our view, for  goods to be categorized as originating from EAC customs territory, they must pass the test of originality set out in  rule 4(1) of the  EAC Rules of Origin as above stated. Section 111 (2) of the EACCMA which is read together with  rule 12 (2) of the Rules of Origin, 2009 provides for  the  procedure  through  which  the  Customs  within  the  member states  may determine originality for the  purpose of preferential  tariff treatments. It provides as follows:-

"(2)  Customs  shall  require  production  of a Certificate of  Origin and other documents as proof  of  origin of  goods referred to in subsection (1) above."[emphasis supplied].

Under the  above  provision,  it  is  clear  and  unambiguous  to  us  that, certificate of origin though a  relevant document in  proving originality of  goods  for  the  purpose  of  preferential  tariff  treatment,  is  not  a conclusive  evidence.  That  is  why,  in  addition  to  it,  Customs  are mandated by the law to, for the purpose of determining originality of the goods,  require others documents in addition to the certificate.  In this  case,  the  respondent  having  established  that,  the  seller  of the goods  was  a  beneficiary  of  the  scheme,  required  the  appellant  to produce other documents in proof that the goods were not manufactured  using  raw materials that enjoyed duty remission  under the  scheme.  The  basis  of  so  requiring  is  that  under  the  express provision  of Article  25(3)  of the  Protocol,  the  importation  of  goods under duty remission scheme within the EACCU  without paying duties is generally prohibited .   We are of the view that, what the respondent did was within the parameters of the respective provision. There being evidence  of  specification  of the  supplier  in  the  Legal  Notice  as  the

beneficiary of the  scheme,  it was expected  for the  respondent to so demand considering the fact that, the certificate did  not indicate that the goods in question were produced using raw materials produced in Kenya.

In our opinion therefore, the tribunal was right in  holding that the certificate of origin alone would  not suffice to establish originality of the goods for the purpose of preferential tariff treatment.

The complaint by the appellant that, the respondent would have invoked  the  verification  procedure  under  rule  12  (3)  of the  Rules of Origin  appears  to  be  irrelevant  since  the  question  was  not  that the certificate  was  doubtable  but  that  on  top  of  the  certificate,  the appellant  was  expected  to  produce  other  relevant  documents  to substantiate that the goods  were not manufactured using raw materials  imported  under  the  scheme.  The  decision,  as  we  said,  is within  the  parameters  of  the  provision  of  section 111  (2)  of  the EACCMA and the Tribunal  cannot be blamed for violating  any  law of the EAC customs management.

In the final result, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
