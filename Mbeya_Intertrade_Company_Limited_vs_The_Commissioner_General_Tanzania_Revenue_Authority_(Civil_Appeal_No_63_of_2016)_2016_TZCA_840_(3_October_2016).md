## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

7th  and  13t h  September &amp; 3rd  October, 2016

## MUGASHA, J.A.:

The  appellant, mbeya  in te r  tra d e   company  lim ited, appeals against the judgment and decree of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal)  in VAT Tax  Appeal  No.  6  of  2004  vide  a  decision  dated  29t h January, 2005.

A brief background of the appeal is to the effect that: The respondent made an additional assessment of Value Added Tax amounting to Tshs.  1,576,175/=  being undeclared sales for the period of July,  1998 to March,  2000  and  issued  a  demand  notice  on 16/9/2003  requiring  the appellant  to  settle  the  tax  liability  within  thirty  (30)  days  or  else  pay interest on  the tax  liability. Since the appellant defaulted  the  respondent closed  the  appellant's  business  premises.  On  22n d   September,  2003  the appellant lodged a  notice of intention to appeal and on 29t h  October, 2003 she  appealed  to  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (The  Board).  On  27t h October,  2004  the  Board  partly  allowed  the  appeal  and  dismissed  other grounds. Aggrieved, the appellant appealed to the Tribunal which on 29t h January, 2005 dismissed the appeal in its entirety.

Still  aggrieved,  the appellant has appealed to this Court.  Apart from asking the Court to allow the appeal, the appellant prayed for an order that she  be  compensated  Tshs.  51,417,146.00  by  the  respondent  for  closing down  her  business  premises  from  1s t   February,  2002  to  16t h   December, 2004.

The appellant was represented  by Mr. John  Laswai,  learned counsel. At the initial  hearing of the appeal on 7t h  September, 2016, the respondent

who was  dully served with the notice of hearing, neither entered appearance  nor  availed  reason  of  absence.  As  such,  we  allowed  the appellant  to  proceed  in  the  absence  of the  respondent  in  terms  of  Rule 112(2) of the (Court of Appeal) Rules, 2009.

Mr. Laswai adopted  the  written submissions  earlier  on  filed to constitute  an  integral  part  in  the  hearing  of  the  appeal.  In  addition  he made  oral  submissions  in  support  of  the  appeal  and  we  reserved  the matter for judgment. However,  in the course of composing  the judgment we noted that some exhibits were missing in the record of appeal and the original case file. We summoned Mr.  Laswai on  13/9/2016 to address us on the  competence  of  the  appeal  on  account  of  the  incomplete  record  of appeal.

Mr.  Laswai  conceded that there are missing exhibits in the record of appeal  such  as,  exhibit  PI  and  R4.  However,  he  argued  that  since  the exhibits were  admitted  and  reflected  in  the  proceedings of the  Board  and the  Tribunal  and  were  in  the  original  case  file, the  Court  can make reference thereto.  He  urged  the Court to compose judgment on the  basis of the hearing of the appeal conducted on 7/9/2016 in terms of Rule 39(1) of the Rules.

In  the  present  matter,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  record  of  appeal before us is incomplete. Several documents  including  the  appellant's receipts and returns for the input tax and output  tax which were introduced  into  evidence  were  not  incorporated  in  the  record  of  appeal. The Exhibits are: pi, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, pio, p ii, P12, P13, P14, P15 and P16. These documents were put in the evidence at the hearing of the appeal before the Board on 26/10/2004 as reflected from pages 177 to 182  of the  record  of appeal.  This  contravened  Rule  96  (1)  (f)  the  Rules which provides:-

"For the purposes o f  an appeal from the High Court or a tribunal ' in  its  original jurisdiction &gt; the  record of appeal shall subject to sub-rule (3) contain .............. all documents put in evidence at the hearing or if such documents are not in English language,  their certified translations.

Save  that the  copies referred to  in paragraphs  (d)  (e)  and (f) shall exclude copies of any documents or any o f their parts that are not relevant to the matters in controversy on the appeal."

Since this is an appeal originating from the Board,  Rule 96 (1) of the Rules must  be  read  together  with  Rule  96  (2)  of  the  Rules  which  reads  as follows:

"For the purposes of any appeal from the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction,  the record of appeal shall contain  documents relating to the proceedings in the trial court corresponding as nearly as may be to those set out in sub-rule (1) ..."

Furthermore, section 25 (2) of the Tax Revenue Appeal Act [CAP 408 re.2002] directs compliance with the provisions of the Appellate Jurisdiction  Act [cap  141  RE.2002] and the  (Court of Appeal)  Rules,  2009 as follows:

"Appeal to the Court of  Appeal shall H e  on matters involving questions of  law only and the provisions of  the Appellate.  Jurisdiction Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply mutatis mutandis to appeals from the decision of  the Tribunal".

In view of the stated position of the law, we are of settled view that, the  Tribunal's  judgment  appealed  against  arose  from  the  proceedings conducted  by  the  Board  whereby  the  missing  exhibits  were  admitted  in evidence. The missing exhibits are vital for the proper determination of the

appeal.  The omission  to  include the  said  vital  documents  in  the  record  of appeal  is fatal  and  it violates the  mandatory  provisions  of  Rules  96(1)  (f) and  96(2)  of  the  Rules.  Therefore,  the  record  of  appeal before  us  is incomplete  and  the  appeal  is  rendered  incompetent.  For  this  reason,  we strike it out with no order as to costs.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 21s t  day of September, 2016.
