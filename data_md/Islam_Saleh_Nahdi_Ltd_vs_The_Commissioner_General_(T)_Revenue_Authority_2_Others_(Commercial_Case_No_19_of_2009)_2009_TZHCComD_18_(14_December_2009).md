## RULING

## MAKARAMBA, J.:

On  the  28 th day  of  May  2009  the  Applicant  filed in this Court  an application  by  way  of  Chamber  Summons  seeking  among  others  for  an order  that  this  Court  be  pleased  to  issue  prerogative  orders  of  certiorari, mandamus  and  prohibition  to remove  into  this Court and quash  the decision of the  1 st  and 2 nd   Respondents dated  16 th   February,  2005 and 23 rd day of February,  2005  (seizure  notice and  forfeiture  order)  and  restore the vehicles with  registration  No.  T 660 ABF and trailer bearing  No.  T130 ABF to the applicant company.

The  Chamber Summons  has  been  taken  at the  instance  of Kinguji  and Company Advocates and  is supported by the affidavit of Talal  Islam Saleh, the Director of the Applicant's Company, together with attached statement.

The application  has  been  preferred  under section  2(2) of the  Judicature and Application  of Laws Act (Cap 358  R.E.  2002),  section  17(2) of the Law Reform  (Fatal  Accidents  and  Miscellaneous  Provisions)(Amendment)  Act No.58 of 1968 (Cap.310 R.E. 2002, section 68(c) and section 95 of the Civil Procedure  Code,  [Cap.33  R.E.  2002  and  any  other enabling  provisions  of the law.

On the 10 th  day of August,  2009, the 3 rd  Respondent raised a preliminary objection  on  a  point of law that the  application  is fatally defective for  being prematurely  before this  Court.  On the 29 th   day  of September,  2009  the  1 st and 2 nd   Respondents also raised  preliminary objection on points of law:

- 1. That the  application  is bad in law for want of the enabling provisions of the law under which it has been brought.
- 2. That  alternatively, the application  is  bad  in  law  for  citing wrong provisions of the law under which it has been purportedly brought.
- 3. That  the application is improperly  before this Honourable Court because  there  exist  an  appropriate  alternative  forum  to  adjudicate upon and redress the applicant's grievances.

The  preliminary  objection  by  consent  of  Counsel  was  disposed  of  by way of written submissions.

A brief background to this application  is quite  in order.  From the affidavit of Talal Islam Saleh, the Applicant, we gather that apparently the Applicant's motor  vehicle  with registration N0.T66O  ABF  and  a  trailer bearing  No.  T  130 ABF,  the subject  matter of this  application,  were seized following  a  seizure  notice  which  was  issued  by  custom  officers  at  the Tunduma  customs  post.  It  would  appear  that  the  said  vehicle  and  trailer were on their way from  Ndola where they had  plied to from  Dar es Salaam to  deliver  a  cargo  of  diesel  oil.  An  inspection  of  the  vehicles  by  customs officials at the Tunduma customs post revealed 10 boxes/cartons containing contraband of top lemon  lotion  in the cabin  bed of the vehicle.  A forfeiture order for the vehicle and its trailer was issued by the Commissioner for Customs and  Excise,  the 2 nd   Respondent herein,  on the

23 rd day  of  February  2005.  The  said  vehicle  and  its trailer  are  still  lying  at the Malawi Cargo,  Mbeya.

In  a  bid to secure the  release of the vehicle and the trailer,  the applicant filed  a  case  in  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board,  Appeal  No.2  of  2005  at Mbeya.  This  was  dismissed by  the Board  on  the  grounds  of  lack  of jurisdiction by the Board. Undeterred, the applicant  filed yet another Application  No. 19 of 2007 by the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal, which on the  16 th   day  of  October,  2007,  it  was  struck  out.  The  applicant  has  now come before this Court, seeking for prerogative orders of certiorari, mandamus  and  prohibition  to remove  into  this Court and quash  the decision of the  1 st  and 2 nd   Respondents dated  16 th   February,  2005 and 23 rd day of February,  2005  (seizure  notice and forfeiture order) and  restore the vehicles with  registration  No.  T 660 ABF  and trailer bearing  No.  T130 ABF to the applicant company. This application has met  with preliminary objections on points of law from the Respondents, which  I  now turn to.

The  journey  in  search  of  justice  undertaken  by  the  Applicant  started before the Tax Revenue Appeals Board at Mbeya in Customs &amp; Excise Tax Appeal  No.2  of  2005  between  Islam  Saleh  Nahdi  Ltd  vs.  Commissioner General.  In  a  decision  delivered  on  02/05/2007,  the  Appeal  was  found  to have  been  incompetently  before  the  Board  because  the  Board  lacked jurisdiction  to  determine  it. It was  accordingly  dismissed. In Application No. 19  of  2007  in  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  at  Dar  es  Salaam between  Islam  Saleh  Nahdi  Ltd  and  Commissioner  General,  which  was application for leave to  appeal  out of time against the judgment and  orders of Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  in  the  Customs  and  Excise  Tax Appeals

No.2  of 2005  dated  2 nd   May 2007,  failed  because  no  notice  of intention  to appeal was issued  in time in  accordance with  Rule 4(1) and the  provisions of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, 2000.

On the 10/08/2009, this Court upon oral application by the 3 rd Respondent's Counsel,  granted  leave to the 3 rd   Respondent to file counter affidavit  by  or  on 10/08/2009. However,  for  reasons  which  are  entirely known to the 3 rd   Respondent, the counter affidavit was filed almost a month later,  on  09/09/2009,  and without the  leave  of this  Court.  As such  it was to be treated as no counter affidavit filed as ordered and this Court proceeded to  order  that  the  3 rd   Respondent  to  file  his  written  submissions  by  or  on 26/10/2009, the applicant by or on  10/11/2009 and rejoinder if any by or on 17/11/2009.

It  is  the  submission  of the  learned  Counsel for the  3 rd   Respondent that the application  is fatally defective for being  prematurely before this Court.  It is the further submission of the learned Counsel for the 3 rd  Respondent that the fatal defect in the application  arose from contravention  by the Applicant of the  order  of  Hon.  Mruma,  J.,  of this  Court,  dated  8 th   May.  2009.  In  his order,  his  Lordship  Mruma,  J.,  had  granted  leave extending the time within which  the Applicant to file  an  application  for  leave  to  apply for  prerogative orders to  29 th   May,  2009.  His  Lordship  however,  refused  to  grant  leave  to the  Applicant  to  file application  for  prerogative orders, and urged  the applicant to argue and give reasons as to why leave should be granted.  It is the  further  submission of  the learned  that in view  of  the decision in COCACOLA  KWANZA  LTD  V  CONCILIATION  BOARD  OF  KINONDONI

AND ATTORNEY GENERAL, Misc. Civil Cause No.91 of 2006 5

(unreported)  the  applicant  having  failed  to  exercise  his  legal  rights  he cannot be allowed to come to court through the back door.

The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Applicant  in  rejoinder  submitted  that  the applicant complied with the order given by Justice A.  R.  Mruma on 8 th  May, 2009  having  filed  the  Application  on  28 th   day  of  May,  2009,  bearing  the following heading:

## 'And  in the Matter  of  an application for  leave to apply  for prerogative Orders of Certiorari, Mandamus and Prohibition'

The  learned  Counsel  for the Applicant submitted  further that this  Court should  administer  justice according  to law  only  without being unduly constrained by rules of procedure and/or technical requirement as stipulated  in  Article  107A(2)  of the  Constitution  of the  United  Republic  of Tanzania. The learned Counsel for the Applicant prayed that the preliminary  objection  raised  by  the  3 rd   Respondent  is  misconceived  and should  be  dismissed  with  costs.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Applicant prayed  in  the  alternative  that  if  the  preliminary  objection  is  upheld,  the applicant  be  given  time  for  leave  to  file  the  document  as  this  Court  may direct.

I would  uphold  the  preliminary  objection  and  strike  out  the  application with  costs.  The  reasons  are  straightforward.  It  is  not  in  dispute  at  all  that the heading of the application is for leave to apply for prerogative Orders of Certiorari,  Mandamus  and  Prohibition.  However,  the  order  sought  by  the applicant has been rendered in the following terms:

"This Honourbale  Court  may  be  pleased  to  issue  prerogative orders of certiorari,  mandamus and prohibition to remove into this Court  and  quash  decision  of  the  first  and  second  respondents dated  16 th   February,  2005  and 23 rd   day of February,  2005  (seizure notice and forfeiture order) and restore the vehicles with registration  N0.T66O ABF and trailer bearing  No.T130 ABF  to  the applicant company.'

The  Application is therefore  for  orders  for  this Court  to issue  the prerogative  orders.  This,  with  due  respect  to  the  learned  Counsel  for the Applicant, cannot  by  any  stretch of imagination be  termed  to be  an application  for  leave  to  apply  for  the  grant  of  prerogative  orders.  The procedure for applying  for  prerogative orders  is  crystal  clear.  An  applicant has  first  to  apply  for  leave  to  apply  for  prerogative  orders. Upon  being granted  such  leave  by the  Court then  the  applicant  proceeds to  apply for the orders.  This is what the law of the land  on  prerogative orders  requires. same  vein insist on court  of  law not  to be  embroiled in technicalities, enjoins  them in the  administering  justice  to

The  legal  requirement  for  an  applicant  to  first  seek  leave  of  the  Court before  applying  for grant  of the  prerogative  orders  goes to  the  root  of the matter itself.  It  is  not therefore  a  requirement which  merely can  be termed as a  procedural technicality.  In  any event the very Constitution which  in  te procedural abide  with, respect  and  apply  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  land,  which  in  this regard include laws governing substantive and procedural matters.

The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Applicant  cannot  therefore  be  heard  to implore upon this Court to brash aside such a strict procedural  requirement which  goes  to  the  very  root  of  the  matter  merely  under  the  guise  of administering justice without being unduly constrained by procedural

technicalities.  Otherwise were  it to  be  so  it would  make the  administration of justice  in  this  country  highly  unpredictable,  with  the  result  that  parties would  not  be  able  to  predict  with  certainty  the  outcome  of their  cases  in courts  of  law.  In  circumstances  of  unpredictability  and  uncertainty  of  the law,  social  life  would  become  unbearable  and  the  rule  of  law  will  be  set asunder thus paving the way for jungle life,  none of us would wish.

In the  event  and  for  the  reasons  explained  above, the preliminary objection  is  hereby  upheld.  The  application  is  fatally  defective  for  having been  preferred  prematurely  before this court and  accordingly  I   strike  it out with costs.  It is accordingly ordered.
