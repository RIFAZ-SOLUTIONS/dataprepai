Tax Revenue Appeal No. 21 of 2016

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

12th  February &amp;  17th   May,  2021

## LEVIRA, 3.A.:

The  appellant,  Tanzania  Tobacco  Processing  Limited  (the  TTPL)  is  a company  dealing  with  green  tobacco  processing.  In  the  years  of  income 2006,  2007  and  2008  the  respondent  had  conducted  an  audit  on  the appellant's tax affairs and came out with a tax assessment report in which, the  respondent  disallowed  the  interest  on  loan  allegedly  paid by  the appellant  to  the  Universal  Leaf Tobacco  Co.  Inc.  of the  United  States  of America  (the  ULTC)  in  terms  of a  Loan  Agreement.  The  decision  of the respondent to disallow the said interest came as a result of Additional  Final

Assessments Nos. F. 420213027 dated 29th September, 2009, F. 420287599 dated  17th   May,  2010 and  F. 420287605 dated  17th  May,  2010 for those respective years in question.

The  appellant  was  aggrieved  by  that  assessment  plus  the  interest charged under  section 99  of  the  Income  Tax  Act, 2004  (the  1TA). Therefore, it unsuccessfully lodged  with  the respondent  a notice of objection which was determined against it. As a result, it instituted appeals in the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board (the Board) in respect  of  those assessments which were consolidated as Tax Appeal  No. 48, 49 and  50 of 2013.  The  Board's  decision  come out on  28th  June,  2016  in  favour of the respondent.  Still  aggrieved,  the  appellant  unsuccessfully  appealed  to  the Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal)  vide  Tax  Appeal  No.  21  of 2016; hence, the current appeal.

To  appreciate  the  present  appeal,  we  find  it appropriate  to  narrate albeit briefly the factual  background leading to this appeal. On  16th  August, 2000,  the  appellant  signed  a 10  years  Loan  Agreement  of  US  Dollars 15,000,000.00  with  the  ULTC.  The  lender  (ULTC)  had  contracted  with equipment  vendors  and placed deposits in order to get processing equipment  built  for  the  borrower  (TTPL).  It  was  further  agreed  that  the

lender would invoice the borrower the cost of his equipment as well as any installation,  shipping;  loading,  freight,  or  other  related  costs  incurred  by the  lender  as  the  equipment  is  shipped  to Tanzania.  Another  term  in  the Agreement  was  that  the  borrower  would  not  actually  draw  down  funds from  the  loan  repayable  over  ten  years,  but  was  required  to  record  the invoices received from the  lender for the cost of the equipment as a  longÂ­ term obligation to the lender. The loan was also to cover the cost of crews contracted by the ULTC  and sent to Morogoro to install the new equipment.  The  interest of the  loan  was agreed  to  be  2%  per annum  as was quoted in US Dollar loans by Standard Chartered Bank.

On  29th  September,  2006,  28th  September,  2007 and  30th  September 2008  the  appellant  filed  with  the  respondent  her  income  tax  returns accompanied with financial statements for the years of income 2006,  2007 and  2008  respectively.  As  intimated  above,  the  respondent  conducted assessment  of  the  appellant's business  affairs and issued notices  of adjusted  assessments for the said  years of income.  As earlier  stated,  the appellant was aggrieved with the adjustments made by the respondent and therefore lodged notices of objections against the three issued assessments.  The  objections  were  considered  and  the  respondent  issued

amended  income tax assessments whereby some items were  reviewed  as per the appellant's objections. However, the respondent maintained disallowance  of  interest  expenses  in  the  years  under  consideration.  The appellant was aggrieved but he unsuccessfully appealed to both, the Board and  the  Tribunal  as  indicated  above.  In  this  appeal,  the  appellant  has presented six grounds as follows:

- 1.  Upon  finding at page  14 o f the Judgment that the issue o f interest rate not being at arm 's length  was not part o f the  Commissioner's decision  which  was  the  subject  o f the  Appellant's  appeal  to  the Board,  the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in  law and fact in upholding the decision o f the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board.  In doing so the Tribunal failed to note that
- i. In dealing with the appeal the Board was exercising appellate jurisdiction and not original  jurisdiction.
- ii. The Board had no jurisdiction to deal with any other matter other  than  those  contained  in  the  grounds  raised  by  the appellant by way o f  appeal.

- iii. There  was no  opportunity for  the  appellant  to  amend  the statement o f  appeal to include grounds or matters which did notarise from the decision o f  the Commissioner.
- iv. The  respondent had no  opportunity in  law to  bring a  new case by way o f  reply to the appellants statement o f  appeal.
- v. The respondent had abandoned the issue o f  interest rate not being at arm 's length in his decision.
- vi. The  appellant submissions in  reply to  the  interest rate  not being at arm 's length was made under  protest; and
- vii. The appellants and or respondent submissions could not give the  Board jurisdiction  to  deal  with  a  m atter  which  did not arise from the Commissioner's decision.
- 2.  Upon finding at page 14 o f the Judgment that the issue o f interest rate not being at arm's length  was not part o f the  Commissioner's decision the Tribunal erred in law and fact in dismissing ground 6 o f the appeal.
- 3.  The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law and fact in failing to hold that the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board had no jurisdiction to deal with the question o f whether instalments taxes had been paid or not

because such issue was not part o f the appellant appeal and did not arise from the Commissioner's decision subject o f the appeal before the Board.

- 4. The  Tribunal erred in  law and fact in  upholding the finding by the Board that the respondent was justified to disallow the interest on loan paid by the Appellant to Universal Leaf Tobacco Company on the ground  that  it  was  not  wholly  and  exclusively  incurred  for  the production o f  income.
- 5.  Upon finding that the Commissioner failed to comply with section 35 of the Income  Tax Act,  2004 the  Tribunal erred in iaw and fact in failing to  conclude that the issue o f interest rate not being at arm's length  was wrongly raised by the Commissioner and entertained by the Board because one can only find that the interest rate is not at arm's length after complying with section 35.
- 6. The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that there was no reason to interfere  with  the Boards decision in not ordering the Commissioner to adjust the interest to the rate considered to be at arm's length.

At the  hearing  of this  appeal,  the appellant was  represented  by  Mr. Gaspar  Nyika,  learned  advocate,  whereas  the  respondent  enjoyed  the services of Ms.  Gloria Achimpota,  Mr. Noah Tito and Mr.  Harold Gugami, all learned Senior State Attorneys.

The  counsel's  submissions  were  preceded  by  Mr.  Nyika's  prayer  to amend  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  add  two  new  grounds  which  were indicated in the appellant's written submissions in terms of Rule 106(3)(b)(ii) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules (the Rules). There was no  objection  to  the  prayer  from  the  respondent's  side.  We  granted  the prayer and the parties made their submissions accordingly.

Mr.  Nyika  commenced  his submission  in  support of the appeal  after having  adopted  the  appellant's  written  submissions.  Regarding  the  first ground of appeal,  he submitted that the main  issue in this appeal and the appeal  before  the  Tribunal  is  that  the  Board's  decision  was  based  on interest rate which was not an issue before the Board.  He pointed out that the Notice of Additional  Final Assessment found at page 1093 of the record of appeal indicated that the interest was charged above market rate which made the appellant to object against Corporate Tax Additional Assessment No.  F.  420213027,  year of income  2006 with  the  respondent as it can  be

seen  at  page  1096  of the  record  of appeal.  Following  that  objection,  the respondent came  up with  a  proposal to settle the objection  (Statement of Changes in  Equity 31s t March,  2008) as it can be seen at page  1031 of the record  of appeal.  However,  the  appellant was  not  satisfied  with  the  said proposal  contending  that  it  was  not correct  because  the  issue  of invoice and  interest was improperly raised.  It was argued that the respondent did not  consider  the  appellant's  explanation  to  that  effect.  This  made  the appellant to lodge her appeal to the Board and categorically stated that the subject matter of the appeal  before the Board was the Amended Notice of Assessment dated 21s t February, 2013.

He  added  that  among  the  grounds  were  that  the  sum  of  Tshs. 1,495,712,912/=  which  the  appellant  had  claimed  as  interest  paid  to  the ULTC,  is  genuine  because the  assets purchased  by the Appellant through the  loan  on  which  the  interest  was  charged  were  utilised  wholly  and exclusively  for  the  production  of the  company's  income.  In  this  regard  it was  argued  that  the  amount  is  therefore  tax  deductible/allowable  as provided for under sections  11 and  12 of the ITA.  He added that, the loan drawdown was in accordance with a  signed  agreement between the ULTC and  the  appellant,  which  agreement  was  registered  with  the  Bank  of

Tanzania (the BOT)  and  Tanzania Investment  Centre (the TIC). He submitted  further  that  another  ground  was  that  the  assets  acquired  in terms  of  the  loan  would  be  productively  used  in  the  production  of  the appellant's  income  and  that,  the  Commissioner  for  Income  Tax  had  no power  to  deem  the  loan  not  at  arm's  length  and  disallow  the  interest expense.

Mr.  Nyika also argued that the respondent brought back the issue of interest when  replying to the statement of appeal as it can  be seen  under paragraph  5  of  the  said reply  where  the  Respondent  stated  that  the interest rate charged on the loan was deemed not to be at arm's length.

The learned counsel argued further that the counsel for the respondent submitted  before the  Board  on  interest  rate and  said  that the loan drawdown was not an issue, the appellant challenged it and urged the Board  not to deal with the issue of interest rate but his argument was not considered  by  the  Board.  However,  the  Board  went  on  deciding  on  the interest  rate  issue  in  favour  of  the  respondent,  a  decision  which  was upheld  by  the Tribunal  despite  its  observation  that  the  interest  rate  was not  part  of  the respondent's  decision but  it said, the  appellant  was supposed to amend the statement.  According to Mr.  Nyika, it was an error

for  the  Tribunal  to  find  that  although  the  issue  of  interest  rate  was  not before the Board, still, it was right to deal with it.

As regards other  grounds of appeal, Mr. Nyika adopted what is stated in appellant's written  submissions with no more. Finally, the learned counsel urged the Court to allow the appeal with costs.

Suffices  here  to  state  that,  we  shall  not  reproduce  the  appellant's submissions in  relation to other grounds of appeal,  but in appropriate time relevant parts of it will  be  referred  to while discussing  related issues to be raised herein.

In reply, Ms. Achimpota adopted the respondent's written submissions,  combined  and  argued grounds  of  appeal  1,  2,  4,  5  and  6 together. Ground  3  was  argued  separately. While responding  to  the clustered  grounds  of  appeal, she  submitted  that  the  central point  in controversy  in  this  appeal  is  the  respondent's  disallowance  of  interest  in three years which  emanated  from  an  arrangement  between  the appellant and the ULTC related to the appellant under section 3 of the 1TA.

She submitted further that, the appellant was required to pay interest charged at a rate quoted by Standard Chartered Bank and 2% of that rate. She cited section  33  (1) of the ITA and  insisted that,  any arrangement to

related  persons  is  to  be  conducted  at  arm's  length  and  any  transaction between  parties  to  be  done  similarly  to  parties  which  are  not  related. According  to  her,  had  it  been  that  the  appellant  borrowed  from  a  local Bank  they  would  be  charged  lesser  interest  than  if  borrowed  from  a company.  She  argued  that  borrowing  from  the  company,  they  violated section  33  of the  ITA  because  the  appellant  was  paying  lesser  tax.  The respondent disallowed the interest expense because the appellant violated section  33  (2)  of the  ITA  by  charging  above the  market  rate and  thus,  it was  not  at  arm's  length.  The  tax  assessment  by  the  respondent  was communicated  to  the  appellant  through  a  letter  found  at  pages  1094  1095 of the record of appeal.  She went on stating that after receiving the letter,  the  appellant  lodged  an  objection  which  is  found  on  page  1096  of the record of appeal.

Ms.  Achimpota  argued  that,  contrary  to  the  appellant's  counsel's submission,  the  appellant  did  not  substantiate  that  the  interest  was  at arm's length. She insisted that the appellant never produced any evidence to prove that the interest charged was at arm's length, an obligation which they  had  under  section  18  (2)  (b)  of the Tax  Revenue  Appeals Act,  Cap. 408 (the TRAA).

To  support  her  argument,  she  cited  the  case Insignia  Limited  v. Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal No. 14  of  2014 and Alliance  One  Tobacco  Tanzania  Limited  v. Commissioner  General  TRA, Civil Appeal No. 118 of 2018 (both unreported)  in  which  the  Court  pressed  on  the  appellant's  duty to  prove the  case.  The  learned  counsel  submitted  that  in  the  current  appeal,  the appellant did  not prove that the interest charged was at arm's length  be it before the Commissioner, Board or Tribunal.

It was her further submission that before the Board, the respondent submitted  that,  the  appellant violated  both  sections  33  (1)  and  35  of the ITA.  According  to  her,  both  sections  have  the  same  effect  that  the  tax payer ends paying  lesser tax.  However,  she clarified that the case at hand centres  on  violation  of arm's  length  principle  under section  33  (1)  of the ITA,  and  that  is  why  even  when  the Tribunal  found  that  the  respondent had  not complied  with  section  35,  it also found that the appellant did  not comply  with  section  33(1).  Vehemently,  Ms.  Achimpota  argued  that  the base of Tribunal's decision under section 35  is that the respondent did not issue  a notice  and  it  is  not  that  there  was  no  tax  arrangement.  She

however  stated  that  section  35  of the  ITA  uses  the  word  "may" which means, it was not mandatory for the respondent to issue a notice.

According  to  her,  although  the appellant claimed  that the  loan  was used to buy equipment, there was no proof to that effect. As a  result, she said,  the  Board  relied  on  section  33  (1)  in  its  decision  which  was  also upheld by the Tribunal.  Ms. Achimpota urged us to uphold that decision.

Responding  to  the  appellant's  claim  that  the  Board  was  wrong  to decide  on  a  matter  brought  by  the  respondent  during  hearing  of  the appeal, Ms. Achimpota argued that the Board has the mandate to hear and determine cases presented by both  parties in terms of Rule  15 (3) and (5) of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Rules  (the  TRAR).  According  to  her,  this procedure was followed  by the  Board  from  page  299 through  344  of the record of appeal.

She argued further that,  nonetheless, the issue of interest not being at arm's  length was  not new as it was the  basis of the objection  decision and  the  appellant  never  brought  the  evidence  on  that  ground  to  prove otherwise.  The  learned  counsel  emphasized  that,  if the  appellant  did  not raise  the issue  of  interest  rate,  the  law  does  not  preclude  her  from addressing  it.  After  all,  she  argued,  the  appellant  was  aware  of what the

respondent was going  to  present during  appeal,  so  she  cannot claim that the right to be heard was violated.

Ms.  Achimpota  contended  that the appellant's  right to  be  heard  was not violated as she referred us at page 311 of the record of appeal, where the appellant submitted  in  chief willingly and  not under  protest about the interest  rate  before  the  Board.  According  to  her,  the  Tribunal  considered this fact and  held  that the appellant was  not condemned  unheard.  In the circumstances, she urged us to find that grounds of appeal  1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are devoid of any merit and dismiss them accordingly.

As  far  as  the  third  ground  of  appeal  is  concerned,  Ms.  Achimpota submitted  that,  this  is  a  factual  issue  regarding  tax  payment.  The  said issue was determined  by the Tribunal and  urged the Court not entertain it because  appeals  to  the  Court  are  on  matters  involving  questions  of  iaw only in  terms of section  25  (2)  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  cap 408 (the TRAA). Finally, she urged us to dismiss this ground of appeal as well.

In addition  to  what  was  presented by  Ms.  Achimpota,  Mr,  Tito submitted in respect of the issue of interest rate to the effect that, the said issue was raised and communicated to the appellant by the Commissioner while  giving  the  assessment  from  page  1094  to  1095  of  the  record  of

appeal. He also stated that there is no difference between interest rate and loan  drawn  down, these are one and the same thing. The decision  of the respondent that the interest was not at arm's length is found at page  1031 of  the  record  of  appeal  and  this  was  one  of the  grounds  to  refuse  the interest rate.  Particularly,  he added that since there was no proof that the appellant was given the loan, the issue of tax avoidance surfaced.  He went on submitting that there was no proof that the appellant bought equipment from  outside and  hence  section  11  of the ITA came  into  play.  He argued that the appellant did  not discharge her burden  in terms of section  18 the TRAA to  prove  that  they  were  supplied  with  equipment  instead  of funds and  thus  the respondent  was right to refuse the interest rate. He concluded by urging us to dismiss this appeal with costs.

In  his  brief  rejoinder,  apart  from  reiterating  his  earlier  submission, Mr.  Nyika  stated  that  the  respondent  appeared  to  abandon  the  issue  of interest  rate  because  his  decision  based  on  loan  drawn  down,  which  he said,  is different from  interest rate.  According to him,  loan drawdown  is to take a  loan while  interest rate is just an  interest.  He also argued that the appellant proved that the equipment  was  supplied that is why  the respondent allowed  the  depreciation  of the same.  He  referred  us to  page

323  of  the  record  of  appeal  and  emphasized  that  the  issue  before  the Board  was  not  interest  rate. He  argued  that  the  respondent  violated section  35  (1)  of  the  ITA  and  that  section  35  (2)  of  the  same  Act  was quoted  out  of  context. Mr. Nyika  insisted  that  the  appellant  was  not accorded the right to be heard in respect of the interest issue. According to him,  the  respondent was  required  to  issue  notice to the  appellant as the respondent  had  no  other option  regardless  of the  word  "may" appearing under the provisions of section 35 of the ITA.

Regarding the third ground of appeal,  he submitted that the same is a  pure  point of law on jurisdiction  of the  Board  which can  be entertained by the Court. Finally, Mr.  Nyika reiterated his submission in chief and urged us to allow the appeal.

We  have  dispassionately considered  the submissions  by the counsel for  both  sides  and  the  record  of appeal.  In  determining  this  appeal,  we shall  combine the  1s t,  2n d ,  4th ,  5t h   and  6t h   grounds of appeal  because they relate  and  the  3r d   ground  separately  just  as  they  were  argued  by  the counsel  for  parties.  The  main  issue  calling  for  our  determination  in  the combined grounds is whether the Tribunal  erred  in  upholding the decision of the  Board  on  interest  rate  issue  which  was allegedly  improperly  raised

by  the  respondent  before  it  in  the  absence  of  a  requisite  notice  to  the appellant

As  indicated  above,  it  was  the  argument  by  the  counsel  for  the appellant that the Board was not justified to deal with the issue of interest rate because,  one, the  Board  had  no justification  to deal with the  issue of interest  rate  because  neither was  it the  basis of respondent's decision  on objection nor was it appealed against by the appellant. Two, the Tribunal's decision to uphold the Board's decision on account that the appellant ought to  have  amended  the  statement  of  appeal  was  improper.  On  the  other hand,  Ms.  Achimpota  for  the  respondent  opposed  the  contention.  She argued that the appellant did  not prove that the interest rate was at arm's length.  Besides, she submitted that, the Board is empowered under the law to hear both parties while entertaining an appeal.

Section  16  of the TRAA which  empowers the  Board to  hear appeals against the decision of the Commissioner General reads:

"Any person  who is aggrieved by the finai determination by the  Commissioner  Genera!  o f the  assessment  o f tax  or  a decision referred to under section  14 o f this Act may appeal to the Board".

In the current appeal, the appellant was aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioner General and therefore she appealed against it before the Board. As intimated above, the appellant was challenging the respondent's disallowance of interest expenses for the years of income 2006,  2007 and 2008; among the grounds of appeal before the Board as appearing at page 18 of the record of appeal was as follows:

"12 (h)  The  Commissioner for Income  Tax does n o t have the pow er to deem  the loan is  n o t a t arm 's length and therefore  d isa llo w  the  in te re st expenses.  The  interest expense is allowed in terms o f  section 11(2) and 12(l)(a) o f the Income Tax Act, 2004". [Emphasis added].

In  the  course  of hearing the appeal  before the  Board, the following issues were framed:

- 1. Whether the  interest on  ioans is an  allowable  deduction under the Income Tax Act, 2004;
- 2.  Whether the Commissioner was legally  justified to disallow interest on the loan paid by the Appellant to Universal Leaf Tobacco Company;
- 3.  Whether the Commissioner was correct in charging interest under section  99 o f the Income  Tax Act,  2004; and

## 4.  To what reliefs are the parties entitled to.

Having  considered  the grounds of appeal  and  the  issues  raised,  the Board  dismissed  the  appeal  for  lack  of  merits.  Aggrieved,  the  appellant unsuccessfully  appealed  to  the  Tribunal  where  the  following  ground  was lodged as the first ground:

## 1. "That the  Tax Appeals Board erred in law and fact in  determ ining the A ppeal on the basis o f the question o f w hether the rate o f  in te re s t  ch a rg e d  w as a t  a rm 's le n g th .  "[Emphasis added].

In  this  ground  the  main  complaints  which  are  also  complaints herein are: First, the appellant was denied the right to be heard on the issue of  interest rate because  the  same  did not  form a basis  of respondent's  decision  on  objection. Second, the  ground  concerning interest  rate  was  not  raised  by  the  appellant  in  her  grounds  of appeal but the respondent in her reply to statement of appeal.

We  wish  to  state  at  the  outset  that,  parties  are  bound  by  their pleadings -  see: Barclays Bank (T) Limited v. Jacob Muro, Civil Appeal No.  357 of 2019 and Samwel Kimaro v. Hidaya  Didas, Civil Appeal  No. 271 of 2018 (both un  re  ported).  It can  be observed from the above quoted statement of facts and  reasons in support of the appeal  before the  Board

that,  the  appellant  in  ground  '12(h)'  was  faulting  the  decision  of  the respondent  on  her  objection  to  the  effect  that  the  respondent  does  not have the power to deem the loan is not at arm's length and to disallow the interest  expenses. In responding  to  the  appellant's  claim  is  when  the respondent stated under paragraph 5 of the reply as follows: -

"5. That  the  contents  o f paragraph  12(h)  o f statement  o f facts  and  reasons  In  support  o f  appeal  are vehemently disputed  and  Respondent  further  states  that  it   is   the in te re s t ra te   ch arged on  the  ioan   th a t  w as  deem ed not to be a t arm 's length . The Commissioner Is empowered under the law to make adjustments and disallow the interests if  he is o f the  opinion  that the interests rates applied were not at arm's length. "'[Emphasis added].

We also observe from the statement of appeal  to the  Board that the appellant gave a background of her complaints as follows:

- "2. In a letter dated 2&amp;h Septem ber, 2009, the Respondent informed the Appellant, inter alia, the following:
- a) that the  Respondent  would disallow the  sum  o f Tshs. 1,628,883,334  which  the Appellant had claimed as interest paid by the Appellant to Universal Leaf Tobacco Company in terms o f a loan agreement entered with  the Appellant  The said loan agreement and registration  with Bank o f Tanzania are attached  and  marked TTPL2, and

- b)  that  the  Respondent  would  charge  Interest  o f  Tshs. 481,340,093.60 in terms o f  section 99 o f  the Income Tax Act 2004.
- 7. In  a  letter  dated  14?h  June  2012,  the  Respondent stated th at W e are o f the view  th a t the loan in te re st is   n o t  a t  a rm 's  ie n g th   due  to  the  fact  that Tanzania Tobacco Processors Lim ited had n o t a ctu a lly  draw n funds from  the loan rather they record invoice received from the lender  for the cost  o f  the equipment  as  a long-term obligation.  The respondent also stated that under section 99 o f  the Income Tax Act interest was imposed as the Appellant had filed NIL  assessment o f tax payable by Instalment and therefore interest o f Tshs.  428,124,406 was due.  The interest calculations is attached and marked TTPL7.
- 8.  The appellant once again wrote to the respondent on 18  th Ju ly   2 0 1 2   disputing  the  disallowed  interest  expenses  o f Tshs. 1,628,883,334  as  the  loan  arrangem ent  w as  an accepted business arrangem ent practiced g lo b a lly and that the loan agreement had been accepted by both the Bank o f Tanzania and Tanzania Investment Centre.  The appellant's letter is attached and marked TTPL7.
- 9. In  a  letter  dated  23rd   January  2013, the  Respondent informed the Appellant that after reviewing  the  arguments contained in the letter o f l&amp; h  July 2012,  th ey w ere unable to agree w ith the A ppellan t's subm ission in  respect o f

the in te re s t expenses and therefore they s t ill m aintained th e ir  p o sitio n  on th is item ...,

The Amended Notice showed that the Income Tax due from the  Appellant  for  the  2006  year  o f  income was Tshs. 1,905,514,640.10,  interest (pursuant to section 99) o f Tshs. 570,906,199.70  and  total  tax  paid  as  Nil. The  Notice  o f Amended Assessment F 420213027 dated 21st February 2013 is   attached and  marked TTPL9.

11. Being aggrieved with the Amended Notice o f  Assessment, the  Appellant  Hied  a  Notice  o f  Intention to appeal  the Respondent's  decision  on  21st  March  2013  with  the Tax Appeals Board....

12.  It is  this A m ended N otice o f  A ssessm ent dated 21st February 2013,  which is the subject matter o f the present appeal on the grounds set out hereunder and detailed in this statement o f  appeal. "[Emphasis added].

In  determining  the  appellant's  complaint  regarding  the  first issue,  the  Tribunal  made  an  observation  that  the  issue  of  interest rate  was  not  part  of the  respondent's  decision.  However,  it  went further to find that the appellant was supposed to establish that the interest rate was at arm's length  before the  Board. The basis of the Tribunal's decision was  that  the respondent  did not  issue  the

appellant  notice  to  that  effect.  Whether  the  appellant  was  issued with a  notice to that effect or rather,  whether she was notified, we need to consider what does it refer by notice and the purposes of it. The  Concise  Law  Dictionary,  4th   Edition,  2012  defines  the  term "notice" as follows:

" i nform ation  concerning  a  fact actually  communicated to  a party by an  authorized person, or actually derived by him from a proper source, or else presumed by law to have been acquired by him,  which information is regarded as equivalent to knowledge in its legal consequences."

In  the  light  of  the  above  definition,  the  question  that  follows  is whether the appellant was made aware or had  knowledge of interest rate not being  at arm's length  in the correspondents between them. According to the record of appeal, the issue of interest rate not being at arm's length was not new to the appellant and the same was not raised in the Board for the first time by the  respondent in the reply to the statement of appeal as claimed  by the  appellant.  With  respect,  we  are  unable to  agree  with  the appellant and both the Board and the Tribunal that the said issue was only raised by the respondent in the reply to the statement of appeal.

It can  be observed from  paragraph 7 of the appellant's statement of appeal  to the  Board  that through  the  letter dated  14th  June  2012,  the respondent  informed  the  appellant  that  the  loan  interest  is  not  at  arm's length  due  to  the  fact  that TTPL  had  not  actually  drawn  funds  from  the loan  rather they recorded  invoice  received from the  lender for the cost of the  equipment  as  a  long-term  obligation.  Being  aggrieved,  the  appellant filed  the  objection  with  the  respondent in that regard  but it was declined. The  respondent  issued  an  Amended  Assessment  in  which  the  said  issue was  not  repeated.  As  indicated under  paragraphs 11 and 12  of  the statement  of  appeal  to  the  Board,  being  aggrieved  with  the  Amended Notice  of Assessment,  the  appellant filed  a  Notice  of Intention  to Appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision on 21st March,  2013  with  the  Tax Appeals Board which was the subject matter of the appeal.

Looking  at  the  sequence  of events  holistically,  it  is  clear  that  the issue of interest rate not being at arm's length was  raised by  the respondent  to  the appellant even before  the respondent  issued  the Amended  Notice  of  Assessment. However,  as  it  can be  observed,  in responding  to the same,  the appellant disputed  the disallowed  interest on account that the loan arrangement was an arrangement accepted by both,

the BOT and TIC. As correctly argued by the counsel for the respondent, in our  considered  view, the appellant's response  to  that  issue did not establish to the respondent that the said interest rate was at arm's length.

We wish to observe further that, the fact that the respondent issued a  Notice  of  Amended  Assessment  after  informing  the  appellant  that  she maintained her position in regard to the interest rate and that the appellant was  aggrieved  by  that  assessment,  is  a  clear  indication  that  the  said decision  of  the  respondent  triggered  the  appellant's  dissatisfaction  and eventually led to an appeal to the Board. We are aware of the requirement of the law under section 97 of the ITA that where the Commissioner makes an assessment is required to serve the written notice of the assessment on the  person  who  was  assessed.  However,  in  our  view,  the  fact  that  the respondent's Amended Notice of Assessment of 21st February, 2013 did not mention  categorically as  it was the case  in  the first  Notice of Assessment (see the  letter of 29th   September,  2009)  that the  interest  rate was not at arm's  length,  in  itself did  not  mean  that the  respondent  had  excused  the appellant  from proving  that  the  interest  rate  was  at  arm's  length  as required under  the  law  -  see: Kilombero  Sugar  Company  Ltd  v.

## Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 261 of 2018 (unreported).

We  do  not  agree  with  the  appellant  that  the respondent  had abandoned the issue of interest rate simply because the subsequent notice did  not  mention  it  categorically.  In  the  light  of the  record  before  us,  the said  issue  was  still  pending  and  it  was  incumbent  upon  the  appellant to prove that the interest rate was at arm's length or not. In the premises, we find  that the appellant failed to discharge her obligation  under the law.  By stating  that  the  loan  arrangement  was  an  accepted  business  practised globally and  that it  had  been  accepted  by the  BOT and  TIC,  in  our view, was  not  sufficient  to  prove  that  indeed  the  interest  rate  was  at  arm's length.  We  are  fortified  in  this  finding  by  the  respondent's  letter  of  18t h July,  2012  informing the appellant that they still  maintained their position regarding the interest rate after receiving the appellant's objection. A close reading  of the  record  of appeal  reveals that what was maintained  by the respondent  was  the issue of interest rate through  the letter of 29 September,  2009  referred  by the appellant above. The said  letter is found at  page 430  of the  record  of appeal  and  also  at  page 63  attached  to the statement of appeal by the appellant; the relevant part of it reads:

## "Note(s) to schedule A:

- 1. Tax avoidance - operations financed by debt from related party (Holding Company), interest is charged above market rate." [Emphasis added].

It  is  therefore  clear  that  the  above  issue  of  interest  rate  remained pending and the appellant did  not substantiate that the interest charged is not above the  market  rate  as  required  by  law  under  section  33(1)  of the ITA which provides that:

"In  any arrangement between persons  who  are associates, the persons shall quantify, apportion and allocate amounts to be Included or deducted in  calculating income between  the persons  as  is necessary  to  reflect  the  total Income  or  tax payable that would have arisen for them if  the arrangement had been conducted at arm's length."

In the circumstances, we do not find any purchase in the appellant's complaint that the Board was moved by the respondent through its reply to the  statement  of  appeal  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  interest  not  being  at arm's  length,  instead  of grounds of appeal  raised  by  the  appellant in  his statement of appeal.  We  proceed to demonstrate that at page 358 of the record of appeal  the  Board  recorded the appellant's first ground of appeal which was crafted as hereunder:

"(a)  The sum  o f Tshs.  1,495,  712,  912/=;  1,534,130,360/= and 727,780,690/= for the years o f income 2006,  2007 and 2008  respectively; which the appellant  had  claimed  as interest paid  to  Universal Leaf Tobacco  Company  (ULT)  is genuine  because  the  assets  purchased  by  the  appellant through loan on  which the interest were charged are  wholly and exclusively  employed  in  production  on  the  company's i ncome. The  amount  therefore  is  deductible under  the provisions o f  sections 11 and 12 o f  Income Tax  Act, 2004."

Moreover, at page 364 of the record of appeal the Board  noted that the  appellant  was  informed  about  interest.  We  wish  to  reproduce  the relevant part of the Boards decision hereunder:

"The respondent also informed the appellant that in respect o f the year  2006  he would  charge interest o f Tshs. 481,340,093.60 in terms o f  section 99 o f  the Income Tax  Act, 2004."

The above excerpts are clear evidence that the appellant was aware of interest charged even  before  lodging of her appeal to the  Board and in fact she was the one who raised it before the Board.

It was the appellant's claim that she responded under protest on the issue  of  interest  rate  as  raised  by  the  respondent  during  hearing  of the appeal  before  the  Board.  However,  as  submitted  by  the  counsel  for  the

respondent, we could not discern that the submission which the appellant's counsel made his submission in chief in this regard was under protest. This is cemented by part of the submission as hereunder reproduced:

"It therefore  follows  that  the  interest  rate  for  instance charged  for  the  year 2006  was  at  the  prim e  rate  o f the Standard Chartered Bank would have been 8.7 if  we were to take  10.7%  interest rate  charged for 2006 minus 2%  that was added on  top  o f the  Standard Charted Bank  Tanzania rate.  I t  is   th e re fo re   d e a r  th a t b ased  on  th e  in te re st rate charged  the  loan  in terest  w as  a t  an arm 's le n g th /'[Emphasis added].

In our view, the cited version is a concession and clear evidence that the  appellant  was  informed  about  the  interest  rate  not  being  at  arm's length.  It  is  our  considered  view  that,  the  appellant  had  an  obligation  to prove  before the  respondent that the interest rate was at arm's length an obligation  which  she did  not discharge  until  when  she took the  matter to the Board.

We note that in dealing with this ground of appeal, the Tribunal was of the view that the Board was wrong in its interpretation of section 35 (1) of the ITA by stating that the requirement of a  notice being  issued  by the respondent  was  optional  as  the  provision  uses  the  word  "may".  We  are

unable  to  agree  with  the  Tribunal's  conclusion  in  this  regard  because following  the  correspondences  between  the appellant and  the  respondent as intimated above, the issue of notice could not arise in the circumstances.

We also  note that the Tribunal's  stance  was  based  on  the  fact that tax  avoidance  is  a  serious  matter  so  the  appellant  ought  to  have  been accorded  the  right  to  be  heard.  Part  of the  Tribunal's  decision  found  at page 810 of the record of appeal is reproduced hereunder:

"The second reason for our interpretation is that the aiiegation  o f tax avoidance  is a  serious m atter so the tax payer has to be properly informed o f  the tax avoidance arrangement and the adjustment made. This  would enable  the  tax payer to  challenge  the Commissioner's  decision if he  has  any  reasons against the decision and therefore get an opportunity to be heard on the matter. I f   no n otice was issued and no specification explained on the  alle g e d   ta x   avoidance  arrangem ent and the  adjustm ents  m ade  how   w ould  the  tax payer defend h im self  The end result  would be that  the  tax payer has  been  condemned unheard and the Commissioner's decision  would be arbitrary which  is contrary to  the principle o f natural  justice

enshrined in the Constitution o f the United Republic of Tanzania&gt; 1977 as amended from  time  to  time. With  those  observations  we  hoid  th at  the respondent acted ultra  vires  and  the  Board was wrong in  upholding its  decision".

[Emphasis added].

However,  we  take  note  that  although  the  Tribunal  held  that  the respondent acted uita  vires by not according  the appellant the  right to  be heard  on  interest  issue  and  that  the  Board  was  wrong  in  upholding  its decision, it had a quite different view while dealing with the appellant's first ground  of  appeal  on  the  claim  that  the  Board  erred  in  law  and  fact  in determining  the  appeal  on  the  basis  of the  question  whether the  rate  of interest charged was at arm's length. At page 801 of the record of appeal, the Tribunal had this to say:-

"With respect to the respondents counsel,  we do not agree with his submission that the issue o f interest rate not being at arm 's length was raised in his final decision.  We agree with the appellant that the issue o f  interest rate not being at arm 's length was  specifically  on  account  o f  the  fact  that  the appellant  had  not  drawn  funds  from  the  loan  and  not because  o f the  interest rate. We  however,  agree  with  the respondent's submissions that the issue  o f in te re st rate

## not being a t arm 's iength was pleaded in  th e ir  re p ly  to the appellant's statem ent o f  appeal". [Emphasis added].

Having  made that observation, the Tribunal  considered the fact that the appellant was accorded the  right to  be heard  before the  Board  in that regard.

As we have intimated above, the issue of interest rate was pleaded by the  appellant  in  his  pleadings  and  the  respondent  in  her  reply  to  the statement  of appeal.  In  the  circumstances,  we  find  that,  the  appellant's claim  that  the  Board  dealt  with  a  matter  which  was  not  decided  by  the respondent is  unfounded.  We  are as well  settled  in  our  mind  that  it was incumbent  upon the appellant to prove to the respondent  that  all expenditure incurred during the years of income under consideration were wholly  and  exclusively  in  the  production  from  the  business,  but that  was not the case. We think, if the appellant thought that the assessment of the respondent was erroneous, she had an obligation to prove the same before the  Board  in terms of section  18  (2) (b) of the TRAA. Therefore, the first, second,  fourth,  fifth  and  sixth  grounds  of appeal  are  without  merit  and dismissed.

Regarding  the third  ground  of appeal,  Ms.  Achimpota  argued  that this is a factual  issue regarding tax payment. The same was determined by

the Tribunal  and  thus  it cannot  be  entertained  by the  Court.  The counsel for the appellant opposed the submission by the respondent's counsel and he  argued  that  this  ground  is  a  point  of  law.  We  have  thoroughly  gone through  the  record  of  appeal  and  we  are  unable  to  find  the  appellant's ground  before  the  Tribunal  challenging  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Board  in taxation.  We  observe  that  at  page  426  of  the  record  of  appeal,  the appellant raised almost a similar ground to the effect that:

"(h)  The  Tax Appeals Board erred in law in holding that the appellant had failed to prove  that it paid the sum  o f Tshs. 1,175,464,257/= and Tshs.  360,270,088/=.  The  Tax Appeal Board erred In:

- (i)  Failing to note that the Respondent did not address the issue o f  payments which was raised in the notice o f  objection in its letter dated l4 h   June  2012  and is  therefore  considered to have accepted the appellant objection on the point
- (ii) That  the respondent  denied  for  the  first  time  during  the hearing o f the appeal o f having not received the tax paid by the appellant.
- (Hi) That  the Tax  Appeal  Board  arrived  at  the  decision  by considering extraneous matters.
- (iv) That the  Tax Appeal Board  was misled by the  respondent receipt which  was stamped on the annexures accompanying the letter dated 2$h  October 2009."

In this appeal the said ground has been presented in the following terms:

"(3)  The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law and fact  in  failing  to  hold  that  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Board had no jurisdiction  to  deal  with  the  question  o f whether instalments taxes had been paid or not because such issue was not part o f the appellant appeal and did not arise  from  the  Commissioner's  decision  subject o f the Appeal before the Board."

As it can  be seen  from  the quoted ground  before the Tribunal, the issue  of jurisdiction  did  not  feature  as  it  is  raised  in  the  current  appeal. However, in this appeal although the appellant mentions the term "jurisdiction",  the  same  focuses  mainly  on  factual  issue  on  payment  of taxes on instalment which was considered and determined by the Tribunal. This  being  a  factual  issue,  it cannot  be  entertained  by  the  Court  because the same was conclusively dealt with by the Board and the Tribunal. This is due to the  reason  that appeals to the  Court are  only  on  points  of law  in terms of section 25(2) of the TRAA -  see: Geita Gold Mining Limited v. Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 132  of  2017; Shell Deep  Water  Tanzania  BV  v.  Commissioner General  (TRA), Civil  Appeal  No. 132  of  2017  and Bulyanhulu  Gold

## Mine  Limited  v.  Commissioner  General  (TRA),  Consolidated, Civil

Appeals Nos. 89 and 90 of 2015 (all unreported)).

For  the  above  stated  reasons,  we  find  the  appeal  non  meritorious.

Accordingly, we dismiss it with costs.
