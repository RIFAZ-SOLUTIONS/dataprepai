## Introduction

This leaflet briefly provides answers to frequently asked questions about One Stop Border Posts.

## Q1)  What is One Stop Border Post?

## Answer

One Stop Border Post is a border crossing where by people, goods and means of transport make a single stop to undertake both exit and entry controls from one State into another.

## Q2)  What  are  the  legal  instruments  that  govern  the  OSBP  operations  in  the  East African Community (EAC)?

## Answer

The key legal instruments that govern OSBP operations in the EAC include the following:

- a) The EAC OSBP Act, 2016 which came in force on 01st October 2016.
- b) The Non-EAC OSBP Act, 2015 (Act No.17 of 2015)
- c) The EAC OSBP Regulations, 2017
- d) OSBP Bilateral Agreements between Tanzania and the Adjoining States

## Q3) In which country do travellers stop for exit controls?

## Answer

In the most commonly applied OSBP system, travellers stop in the country of arrival for both exit and entry controls.

## Q4) Is it necessary to undergo exit formalities even after physically entering another country?

## Answer

Yes, it is necessary to undergo all exit controls because travellers, goods and the means of transport  will  remain  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  country  of  exit  until  aII  exit  controls  are completed. Exit controls should be completed before entry controls.

## Q5) What is a common control zone in OSBP?

## A nswer

A common control zone is the territory of the host Partner State within which officers of the adjoining Partner State effect border controls. It includes an exclusive use area. An exclusive use area means that area of the control zone dedicated for the exclusive use of each of the adjoining Partner States.

## Q6) Are all OSBPs configured in the same way?

## Answer

There  are  different  models  of  OSBPs.  In  the  EAC,  the  juxtaposed  model  is  the  most common.  A  juxtaposed  OSBP  is  one  where  two  border  facilities,  one  in  each  adjoining Partner  State,  are  interlinked  through  secure  approach  routes  where  traffic  is  designed  to flow in one direction. A single country or wholly located OSBP model is one where there is one  control  zone,  in  one  of  the  adjoining  Partner  State  that  is  interlinked  to  the  other adjoining Partner State's physical border by way of secure approach routes which are part of the control zone. A straddling OSBP model is one where there is one control zone, literally positioned on the borderline, in such a way that one part of the control zone is physically situated within the territory of each of the adjoining Partner States.

## Q7) Can officials of the host Partner State perform border controls on behalf of the adjoining Partner State?

## Answer

At the OSBP, each Partner State is responsible for administering its own national laws at the border.  However  in  so  doing  they  use  one  location  to  do  the  controls  and  thus  reduce clearance time of goods and passengers. In case of goods examination the work is done together.

## Q8) Who is responsible for coordinating joint verifications at the OSBP?

## Answer

The lead agencies are responsible for coordinating joint physical verifications. However, only the concerned agencies may participate during verifications.

## Q9) Which Partner State is responsible for the maintenance of peace, security, law and order in the OSBP?

## Answer

The maintenance of peace, security   law and order in an OSBP is the responsibility of the host  Partner  State  on  each  side.    However,  the    host    Partner    State    may    request    the assistance of the  adjoining Partner  State  should circumstances warrant.

## Q10) Can facilitation agents provide their services to clients from both Partner States at the OSBP?

## Answer

Under the EAC Customs Management Act, 2004 Clearing and Forwarding Agents may only provide services in the Partner State where they are licensed to operate. Therefore, clearing and forwarding agents may only provide exit related services in the Partner State of arrival.

## Q11) How can you identify facilitation agents for the respective Partner States at the OSBP?

## Answer

All facilitation agents operating at OSBPs in the EAC are required by the law to display their identity badges or other agreed form of identification when working in the control zone.

## Q12) Which Partner State is responsible for the maintenance of OSBP facilities? Answer

Unless otherwise agreed, each Partner State is responsible for maintaining OSBP facilities located in its territory.

## Q13)  Are  border  community  residents  expected  to  fulfill  the  same  immigration requirements as other travellers when crossing the border at an OSBP?

## Answer

Except where otherwise agreed, all international travellers are by the law required to undergo entry  and  exit  formalities  when  moving  from  the  jurisdiction  of  one  country  to  the  other. However,  at  border  crossings  where  OSBPs  have  been  established,  border  community residents enjoy simplified procedures.

## Q14)  Are  border  community  residents  required  to  pay  duty  and  taxes  on  goods imported through OSBPs?

## Answer

The importation and exportation of goods in the East African Community (EAC) is governed by  the  EAC  Customs  Management Act, 2004 and its related  instruments.  Under the  EAC Customs Union, the simplified Trade Regime (STR) is a special provision aimed at facilitating trade  by  small  scale  traders  who  regularly  trade  low  value  consignments.  An  approved simplified  certificate  of  origin  (SCoO)  exempts  consignment  of  goods  that  originate  in  the EAC  and  are  valued  at  under  US$2,000  from  payment  of  import  duties  in  the  EAC destination country. Border community residents with small quantities of imported products for  personal  use  may  be  exempted  from  paying  duties  and  taxes  in  line  with  travellers' rebates as provided for in the EAC Customs Management Act.

## Q15) Are there user charges levied at the OSBPs?

## Answer

The  decision  to  levy  charges  is  guided  by  national  policies  governing  border  operations. Some  Partner  States  may  charge  user  fees  for  selected  services.  Please  confirm  the situation with relevant Authorities of each Partner State at the border.

## Q16) Do all OSBPs in the EAC operate 24/7?

## Answer

While  it  is  a  policy  of  the  EAC  that  all  border  posts  should  remain  open  at  all  times  to facilitate  the  movement  of  goods  and  people,  actual  operating  hours  are  determined  by operational and administrative considerations at each OSBP.

## Q17) How can I learn more about OSBP procedures in the EAC?

## Answer

For more information about OSBP procedures, please contact TRA offices or other border agencies at the nearest OSBP, the Ministry responsible of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation  (Tanzania),  Ministry  responsible  for  EAC  affairs  in  the  other  East  African Community countries or the EAC Secretariat in Arusha, Tanzania.

## Q18) How many OSBPs are there?

## Answer

There are nine OSBPs in Tanzania. The names of the OSBPs and their respective OSBPs of the adjoining State are: Holili/Taveta-Kenya, Rusumo/Rusumo-Rwanda, Mutukula/MutukulaUganda, Kabanga/Kobero-Burundi, Horohoro/Lungalunga-Kenya, Sirari/Isebania-Kenya, Tunduma/Nakonde-Zambia, Kasumulu/Songwe-Malawi and Namanga/Namanga-Kenya.

## Q19) What is the difference between Single Customs Territory (SCT) and OSBP?

## Answer

SCT and OSBP are all about single declaration and single stop respectively as against the conventional  approach  of  having  double  declarations  and  two  stops.  SCT  is  the  stage towards the full attainment of Customs Union which is attainable by the removal of duties and restrictive  regulations  and  the  minimization  of  internal  border  controls between  Partner States.  The  main  feature  of  SCT  is  single  declaration  done  in  the  destination  country followed by free movement of the goods. OSBP is an attribute towards trade facilitation. It's mainly a border crossing whereby people, goods and means of transport stop only once for clearance (exit and entry formalities) in the country of entry.
