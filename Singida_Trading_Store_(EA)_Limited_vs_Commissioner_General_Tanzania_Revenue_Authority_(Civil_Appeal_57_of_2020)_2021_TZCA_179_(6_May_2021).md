## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

21s :  April  &amp; 6th   May, 2021

## KEREFU. J.A.:

The  appellant,  Singita  Trading  Store  (EA)  Limited  has  lodged this  appeal  challenging  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) which dismissed its appeal against the decision of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  in  favour  of  the respondent,  the  Commissioner  General  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority (the TRA).

Most  of  the  facts  forming  the  background  of  the  appeal  as obtained  from  the  record  are,  fortunately,  not  in  dispute.  They  go thus: The  appellant  is  a registered  company  having  its  place  of business  in  Mara  Region.  Specifically,  the  appellant  operates  retail shops in rented premises within the tourists' hotels owned by Grumeti Reserve  Limited  in  Serengeti  National  Park  where  it  sells  luxurious items with distinctive character.

On  1s t   July, 2007,  the  appellant  entered  into  a  management agreement with Singita Trading Stores (Pty) Ltd  based in South Africa (sister  company)  to  manage  its  retail  business.  Later,  in  2013,  the respondent conducted an audit on various tax affairs of the appellant's  income for the years  2010,  2011  and  2012,  respectively. The respondent found that the appellant had not paid withholding tax on  management  fees  for  the  services  rendered  in  Tanzania  to  its sister  company  in  the  said  years.  Thus,  on  4t h   October,  2013,  the respondent issued Withholding Tax  Certificates to the appellant demanding withholding tax and interests to the tune of TZS 12,573,422.59,  TZS  20,153,424.45  and  TZS  33,693,792.15  for  the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Dissatisfied, the appellant lodged three statements of appeal in the Board which were later consolidated into Income Tax Appeal Case Nos.  123,  124  and  125  of  2013.  The  appellant's  grounds  of appeal before the Board in each appeal were as follows; -

- (1) That,  the  demand issued by the respondent is both wrong  at  law  and  fact  for  containing arithmetical errors; and
- (2) That, the respondent's act of  issuing the demand  for  withholding  tax  is  arbitrary  for failure to provide the appellant an opportunity to be heard with regard to the various tax queries raised  by the respondent

The respondent disputed both grounds and the Board determined the appeal based on parties' submissions on the following three issues: -

- (1) Whether  the  respondent's  demand  was  legally  and factually correct;
- (2) Whether the appellant was given the opportunity to respond to  tax queries raised by the respondent; and
- (3) To what reliefs are the parties entitled.

The Board considered the parties' submissions and  rendered its decision  on  27t h  April,  2018  in  favour  of the  respondent.  Aggrieved, the appellant unsuccessfully appealed to the Tribunal. Still unsatisfied, the appellant has lodged the current appeal with four grounds which, for  reasons that will  shortly come  to  light,  we  need  not recite them herein.

At  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  Mr.  Allan  Nyaki  Kileo,  learned counsel represented the appellant whereas  the respondent  was represented  by  Ms.  Alice  E.  Mtulo  and  Mr.  Hospis  Maswanyia,  both learned Senior State Attorneys. The counsel for the parties had earlier on  filed  their  respective  written  submissions  in  accordance  with  Rule 106  (1)  and  (7)  of the  Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009  the  contents of which each adopted before addressing us orally.

When  invited  to  amplify  on  the  grounds  of  appeal,  Mr.  Kileo sought and  obtained  leave to  abandon  the  second,  third  and  fourth grounds  of  appeal  and  submit  only  on  the  first  ground.  The  said ground is to the effect that: -

"The  Tribunal erred in  taw and in  fact in  holding that the Board  was  correct  to hold  that  the respondent used correct currency in  computing

## withholding  tax liability alleged to  be  due  on  the appellant."

In  his  written  submission,  in  respect of the  above  ground,  Mr. Kileo  faulted  the  Tribunal's  decision  upholding  the  Board's  decision that  the payments  made  between  the  parties  in  respect  of  the management agreement was  in  United  States  Dollars  (US$)  despite the fact that some of the invoices issued did  not indicate the type of currency used while others were issued in South African Rands (ZAR). Mr. Kileo argued further that during the audit exercise, the respondent  acknowledged  that  some  of the  invoices  were  issued  in ZAR.  However,  after  perusing  the  management  agreement  and  the financial  statement, the respondent arrived at the conclusion that the invoices  issued  were  in  US$  currency,  hence  issued  withholding  tax demand also in  US$.  It was his further argument that,  it was wrong for  the  Board  and the Tribunal  to agree with  the  respondent on this point.

However,  in  his  oral  submission,  Mr.  Kileo  impressed  upon  us that the appellant's claim on that ground  is not in  relation to the type of currency used by the respondent but the amount of withholding tax demanded by the respondent,  which  he said,  it was on the high  side

by reason  of  arithmetic  errors. He  specifically  referred us  to  the Withholding Tax  Certificates/Interest (exhibit Al) issued by the respondent  demanding  withholding  tax  and  interests  amounting  to TZS  12,573,422.59,  TZS  20,153,4g24.45  and  TZS  33,693,792.15  for the  years  2010,  2011  and  2012,  respectively.  He  then  argued  that computing the 15% withholding tax from the payments made for the said  years,  the  resultant  liability  against  the  appellant  will  be  US$ 1800,  US$  900  and  US$  907.5,  respectively.  According  to  him,  the total  amount the  appellant  was  supposed  to  pay as  withholding  tax for the said years was US$  3,607.5  and  not TZS 54.6  Million claimed by  the  respondent.  He contended that,  if the  Board  and the Tribunal could  have considered the evidence on  record  and critically analyzed exhibits Al, A2, R3 and R4, they  would have  found  that  the management  fee  demanded  by  the  respondent  had  an  arithmetic error. As such, Mr. Kileo invited us to re-evaluate the said exhibits and specifically the  figures  and  calculations  made  thereto  to arrive at an appropriate amount which the appellant is obliged to pay.

To justify  his  proposition,  he cited  the case of Deemay Daati and  2  Others  v. Republic, Criminal Appeal, No. 80  of 1994 (unreported)  where  the  Court  restated  the  principle  that  second

appellate  court  is empowered  to  re-evaluate the  evidence  on  record and  make its own findings of fact when there is misdirection or nonÂ­ direction  on  the  evidence  or the  lower  courts  have  misapprehended tho substance,  nature and quality of the evidence.  He then concluded that this Court should  revisit the evidence on  record  and come to  its own finding.

In his response, Mr. Maswanyia strongly disputed the above oral submissions advanced by Mr.  Kileo that it has introduced a new issue which was  never  raised  and considered by  the Board  and  the Tribunal.  He  referred  us to the appellant's written  submission  before the Board found at page 83 of the record and argued that before the Board  and  the  Tribunal  the  appellant  submitted  that  the  arithmetic error was occasioned by the use of wrong currency  and not otherwise.  He  said,  since  the  oral  submission  is  introducing  a  new aspect in this case, the same should be disregarded by this Court.

As  regards the  appellant's written  submissions,  Mr.  Maswanyia -F" argued  that  there  is  no  dispute  that  the  invoices  availed  by  the appellant  did  not  disclose  the  types  of currency  used.  Therefore,  to ascertain the type of currency and the amounts contained in the said invoices,  the respondent  resorted  to  the  management  agreement

(exhibit  R2)  found  at  page  122  of  the  record  of  the  appeal  where under  para  4  of  the  said  agreement, it is clearly  indicated  that payments  between  the  parties  are  supposed  to be in US$. Mr. Maswanyia  also  referred  us  to  the  notes  to  the  appellant's  financial statements (exhibit R3)  found  at page  143  of the record,  where the accounting  system  of the  appellant  is  in  US$.  He  then  argued  that, tht; Board and the Tribunal considered exhibits Al, A2, R2 and R3 and wore satisfied that the appellants payments of the  management fees to its counterparts was in US$.

It was the strong argument of Mr.  Maswanyia that the issue of proving  whether the  invoices  were  in  US$  or  otherwise  is  a  factual issue which needs to be ascertained by evidence.  He contended that, since the  said  issue  was  properly  considered  and  determined  by the Board and the Tribunal this Court has no jurisdiction to reconsider the same on the strength  of section  25  (2)  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  [Cap  408  R.E.  2019]  (the  TRAA).  He  emphasized  that,  since under that section the appellant is only required to appeal on matters of  law,  she cannot be heard at this stage on a factual finding  by the Board and the Tribunal.  He distinguished the case of Deemay Daati and  2 Others (supra)  relied  upon  by  Mr.  Kileo  by  arguing  that the

facts in that criminal case are not applicable to the current tax appeal. Based  on  his  submissions,  Mr.  Maswanyia  urged  us  to  dismiss  the appeal with costs.

On  our  part,  before  we consider the  submissions  made  by the counsel for the parties in respect of the above ground, we wish to put the record straight in the light of the appellant's oral submissions.

We have noted that all along, the appellant's claim  before the Board, the Tribunal and  even this Court in  respect of the above ground was predicated  on  an  arithmetic  error  occasioned  by  the  use  of  wrong currency by the respondent in its withholding tax demands.  This can be evidenced by the appellant's written submissions before the Board on this aspect found at page 83 of the record where she argued that:

"As regards arithmetic correctness, it is our respectful submission  that it is factually wrong for containing arithmetical error and currency errors. In its  email dated 24h   October,  2013,  the  appellant informed the respondent that the currency used in computing withholding tax was incorrect  While the appellant management fee  invoices  value  was  in South African Rands (ZAR), the TRA have considered the values as US Dollars. In a response through email dated  24h October, 2014, the

respondent conceded that indeed the currency used in computing the withholding tax is wrong.  We pray that the appellant's letter dated 25t h  October, 2013 and the respondent's email of 24h   October,  2013 attesting  to  this  fact  be  collectively  admitted  as exhibits in this appeal. These documents  are attached  to  this  submission  marked annexures  2 and 3, respectively."

The  respondent's  response  to  that  ground  as  per  the  written submissions  found  at  pages  92  -  93  of  the  record  of  appeal  goes thus: -

" The appellant's management invoices values were in  unspecified currency.  To attest to this position, we attach  the copies of the respective invoices to this submission and pray that the said invoices be collectively  admitted  as  exhibit  in this  Appeal. Looking at the said invoices you  will clearly note that  the  said  invoices  only  show  the  amount (figures)  of the management fee  charged,  but do not specify the type of currency to be paid by the appellant to the service providers...Thus to ascertain the type of  currency used  by the appellant to pay management fees to  the service provider, we  examined  other  documents  produced  by  the appellant  during  the  audit  exercise. These  other documents  included  the  management  agreement

entered  into  between  the  appellant  and  Singita Trading  Stores (Pty) Ltd  of  South Africa and financial statements  (Accounts)  submitted by  the appellant  for  tax  purposes  for  years  of  income 2010, 2011 and2012."

The  Board  considered  the  above  submissions and concluded  at page 166 of the record of appeal that: -

" We  are  convinced  that  there  is  evidence  that suffices  to  prove  that  the  appellant  was  paying management  fees  billed  by  Ms. Singita Trading Stores  (Pty)  Ltd  of South  Africa  in  US  Dollars, exhibit R3 proves  this fact.  Equally,  exhibit R2  is dear  that  it  had  been  agreed  that  management fees would be payable in US Dollars. The appellant's advocate contention that the respondent's offices had admitted usage of wrong currency cannot outweigh dear terms of  an agreement signed by the appellant leave alone the appellant's own notes of  financial  statements."

The same iine of arguments by the parties featured again before the Tribunal where they argued the appellant's first ground of appeal that, "the  Board  was  wrong  in  fact  by  failing  to  hold  that  the respondent used the wrong currency in computing the withholding

tax  allegedly  to  be  due." The Tribunal considered the parties' suomissions on that ground and  upheld the decision  of the  Board as indicated above.

It is also  evident  that, in his  written  submission, Mr. Kileo argued the first ground  of appeal  in  the  same  manner disputing the currency used by the respondent in the withholding tax demands.

There  is  no  doubt  that the  oral  submission  made  by  Mr.  Kileo before us do not match with his written submission. With respect, we find the move taken by Mr. Kileo to be irregular and a surprise to the respondent, because instead of highlighting on his written submissions, Mr. Kileo introduced  a new  issue  which  was  never considered  and  determined  by the  Board and  the Tribunal. This  kind of practice is nothing  less than  introducing a  fresh  litigation  between the parties  which cannot be  permitted at this stage.  Accordingly, we are constrained to decline to consider the oral  submissions  made  by Mr.  Kileo  before  us.  In  doing  so,  we  find  solace  in  our  previous decision in Blue Line Enterprises Limited v. East  African Development  Bank, Civil  Application  No.  21  of 2012  (unreported) where  we  quoted  with  approval  an  old  decision  in Haystead  v.

Commissioner of Taxation [1920]  A.C  155  at  page  166  whereby Lord Shaw observed that: -

" Parties are not permitted to begin  fresh  Utigation because of  new views they may entertain of  the iaw of  the case or new version which they  present  so as to  what should be a proper apprehension,  by the Court of  the legal resuit... If  this were permitted, Utigation  would  have  no  end  except  when iegai ingenuity is exhausted. " [Emphasis added].

[See  also  the  cases  of Georgio  Anagnostou  and  Another  v. Emmanuel Marangakis and Another, Civil Application  No.  464/01 of  2018  and Chacha Jeremiah  Murimi  &amp; 3 Others v.  Republic, Criminal Application No. 69/08 of 2019].

We  need  not  overemphasize  the  principle  that  litigants  shouid not  be  allowed  to  change  their  goal  posts  when  new  views  are discovered in the course of litigation. We may go further and add that permitting the appellant's counsel ingenuity to prevail over  the relevant  law  including  the  rules  regulating  the  procedure  before this Court does not accord with the smooth conduct of litigation depriving the other party from  pursuing  his case free from  surprises. With the

above,  we  will  now turn  our  attention  to  the  first  ground  of appeal indicated above.

Back to  the  first  ground  of appeal,  we  think  Mr.  Maswanyia  is correct  in submitting  that  tax  appeals  to  this  Court  are  only  on matters of law and not facts. This is in accordance with section 25 (2) of the TRM which state that: -

' ! Appeals  to  the  Court of Appeal shall lie  on matters Involving questions of law only and the provisions of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act and the  rules  made  thereunder  shall  apply  mutatis mutandis  to  appeals  from the  decision of  the Tribunal. "[Emphasis added].

There are several  decisions of this Court to that effect.  See for instance cases of Shell Deep Water Tanzania BV v. Commissioner General  Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 123 of 2018, Geita Gold Mining Limited v. Commissioner General  Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 9 of  2019  and Atlas  Copco  Tanzania  Limited  v. Commissioner General  Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No.  167 of 2019 (all unreported). In the latter case, the Court

considered  the  applicability  of section  25  (2)  of TRAA and  expressly defined what was meant by a question of law; -

"Thus,  for  the  purpose  of section  25  (2)  of the TRAA,  we think , a question of  law means any of  the following: First, an issue on the interpretation of  a provision  of the  Constitution,  a statute,  subsidiary legislation  or  any  legal  doctrine  on  tax  revenue administration. Secondly, a question on the application  by  the  Tribunal  of a  provision  of the Constitution, a statute, subsidiary legislation or any legal doctrine to the evidence on record. Finally, a question on a conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal where there is failure to evaluate the evidence or if there  no  evidence  to  support  it  or  that  it  is  so perverse  or so  illegal  that no  reasonable  tribunal would arrive at  it ."

We shall be guided by the above authorities to determine whether the ground canvased by the appellant's learned counsel passes the test of a  question of law which the Court has jurisdiction  in terms of section 25 (2) of the TRAA.

The  appellant's  complaint  in respect  of  the  first  ground  of appeal relates to the Tribunal's decision  upholding the decision of the

Board that the respondent used correct currency in computing withholding tax liability due to the appellant.  It is on  record that, the appellant  submitted  before  the  Board  invoices  which  did  not  specify the type of currency  used to pay the service  providers. Therefore, to ascertain the type of currency used by the parties, the Board and the Tribunal  resorted  to  paragraph  4  of  the  management  agreement (exhibit  R2)  between  the  parties  where  it  is  clearly  indicated  that payment between the  parties should  be  in  the  US$.  In  addition,  the Board  and  the  Tribunal  scrutinized  Exhibits  Al,  A2,  R3  and  R4  to arrive  at  their  decisions. Specifically,  at  pages  302  -   304  of  the record,  in  upholding  the  decision  of  the  Board  on  this  aspect,  the Tribunal stated that: -

"The  invoices  do  not specify  the  currency  of the value they carry;  what evidence is better than the management  agreement entered between the appellant and  its counterparts to explain the missing thing."

On that account, we are of the settled view that the appellant's complaint on this  matter  raises  purely a  factual  matter which  cannot be entertained by this Court at this stage in terms of section 25 (2) of TRAA.  Going through the  record,  and  having considered the decision

of the Tribunal on this aspect, it is clear that the appellant's complaint was  sufficiently  dealt  with  by  the  Tribunal  and  it  being  on  factual matters,  it  ought to  end  there.  In  the  case  of Insginia  Limited  v. Commissioner  General, Tanzania Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal No. 14 of  2007 (unreported) when  faced with an akin situation, the Court stated that: -

"It is  therefore  evident that appeals  to  this  Court from  the  Tribunal should involve only questions of law. The  appellant  is  not  permitted  to  reopen factual issues in support of the appeal.  The appeal should be decided upon a consideration of the law only  and  nothing else. We  are  therefore not persuaded  that  the  first  and  fourth  grounds  of appeal concern points of law.  The first and fourth grounds of  appeal relate to an evaluation of  the fact in  exhibits  RE 2;  RE 3  and  RE  4 .  For  instance, exhibit RE  2 concerns a determination of  whether or not the figures therein are actual sales or projections."

In the above case, the Court declined to consider the first and fourth grounds of appeal, which it found to be raising factual issues as opposed to questions of law.

Similarly, in the appeal at hand, since the appellant is inviting us to re-evaluate the evidence on record and specifically, exhibits Al, A2, R3 and R4 to arrive at different calculations and amount to be paid by the appellant as withholding tax, we decline the invitation.

In  the  circumstances,  we  uphold  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal and dismiss the appeal with costs.
