14 th Sept. &amp; 18 th October 2023.

## A.P.KILIMI,  J.:

This is an appeal against a ruling delivered in Civil Case No. 1 of 2022 before the Resident Magistrate Court of Moshi at Moshi on the preliminary objection raised by the respondent. Before the trial court the appellant sued the defendant claiming a sum of Tshs. 20,000,000/= being compensation for the value of the confiscated and unlawful detaining of his motor vehicle, monthly interest at the rate of 7% from the date the vehicle was confiscated to the date of full payment and Tshs. 7,000,000/= as general damages.

The  defendant  raised  a  preliminary  objection  that  the  plaint  was incompetent before the court for having contravened Section 53(1) of Cap 438 R.E. 2019 and Section 7 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap 408 R.E.

2019. After hearing of the objection, the trial court upheld the preliminary objection  and  dismissed  the  suit.  Now,  aggrieved  by  the  decision  the appellant preferred the present appeal on two grounds as follows;

- 1. That the honourable Magistrate erred in law in holding that the suit before her arose out of revenue and proceeded to dismiss it.
- 2. That the honourable Magistrate erred in law and fact by concluding that the trial court was not clothed with jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

The above grounds of appeal were followed by prayers that the appeal be allowed, the dispute be determined on merit and cost be borne by the respondent.  At  the  hearing  the  appellant  was  represented  by  Ms.  Lilian Justus learned advocate while the respondent was represented by Mr. Brian Magoma learned state attorney. It was prayed that the appeal be heard by way of written submissions and the court granted the prayer followed by a scheduling order. I will refer to those submission in due course when the need arises.

Submitting on the first ground of appeal, Ms. Lilian submitted that not every suit involving Tanzania Revenue Authority (the Respondent) is to be entertained by the Board. She contended that even the Board's jurisdiction had limitations.  Citing Section 7 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap 408 '

TRAA' the learned counsel submitted that the Board has sole jurisdiction only in respect of disputes arising from the revenue laws administered by Tanzania Revenue Authority. She argued further that the word revenue as defined  under  section  3  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act  include  "Taxes, duties, fees, levies, fines or other monies imposed or collected ... under the revenue laws listed in the First Schedule of the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act. It was her submission that nothing had been put forward by parties in their  pleadings indicating  that  the  dispute  arose  from  taxes, duties,  fees, levies or fines collected from revenue laws, thus, cannot fall on objection decision of the Commissioner General, to fortify her view referred the case of Pan African Energy vs Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 172 of 2020

She further argued that what can be gleaned from the Plaint is that this  was merely a dispute for a demand of a chattel that was wrongfully taken from the Appellant without any substantiated legal basis. The learned counsel submitted that the trial magistrate had erred per in curium when she came to the finding that the suit before her arose out of revenue and thus ought to have been filed before the Board. She was of the view that had this suit been so filed before the Board even the Board would have dismissed it

for want of jurisdiction. She supported her argument with the case of Shana General Stores Limited vs Commissioner General (TRA) , Civil Appeal No 369 of 2021.

Submitting on the second ground of appeal which was to the effect that  the  trial  magistrate  erred  by  concluding  that  the  trial  court  was  not clothed with jurisdiction to entertain the suit, Ms. Justus stated that the trial magistrate had erred since her ruling was based on allegations raised by the Respondent in their submission which were not pleaded and needed to be ascertained  or  required  proof.  She  contended  that  it  is  trite  law  that submissions cannot include non-pleaded facts and arguing so she cited the case of Astepro Investment Company Limited vs Jawinga Company Limited, Civil Appeal No. 8 of 2015 (Unreported).

Ms. Lilian further submitted that contrary to requirement of law that on objection needs only legal arguments and not ascertainment of facts, thus the  allegation  by  the  respondent  that  the  Commissioner  General  was implementing the Motor Vehicle (Tax Registration and Transfer) Act Cap 124 Act  were  first not  pleaded  and  two they  are  facts  that  ought  to  be ascertained. She thus argued that the trial Magistrate relying on that facts in holding that the Trial Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit at the

point of preliminary objections was a gross error and miscarriage of justice on part of the Appellant and discouraged as per the case of Mukisa Biscuit.

Concluding  her  submission  Ms.  Justus  submitted  that  there  was  no appealable objection decision nor was there any revenue dispute upon which an appeal to the Board would lie. She contended further that the suit was proper before Trial Court and not before the Tax Appeals Board for it is not at all a tax or revenue dispute and as such the Board is not clothed with Jurisdiction to try it. in the end the learned counsel pleaded with the court to allow the appeal and prayed that the Ruling by the trial Magistrate be quashed and set aside and for the matter be remitted back to the trial court to be heard on merit.

Responding to the above Mr. Brian submitted that the Trial Magistrate had correctly decided, due to the provisions of section 7 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap 408 R. E. 2019. He further submitted that the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act, Cap. 339 R. E. 2019 under the provisions of section 5(1) (a) read together with the First Schedule of the same, provides for the list of laws administered by the Authority. It was thus his submission that Appellant instead of consulting the above provision for the sake of noting the revenue laws applied, decided to consult section 3 of the Tax Revenue

Appeals Act (supra) and as such misdirected herself as to what is the gist of the provision. It was his considered view that what is at point is the revenue laws administered by the Authority and not what administered by revenue. He further argued that the trial magistrate was right as stated in her ruling that issues of motor vehicle registration and/ or transfer of motor vehicles are governed by the Motor Vehicle (Tax Registration and Transfer) Act, Cap. 124 R. E. 2019 and Road Traffic Act, Cap. 168 of which both are listed under the First Schedule to the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act through item 8 and 15. He contended further, that the issue at hand arose from administration of revenue laws and therefore the Trial Court had no jurisdiction to try the matter.

Submitting further it was the respondent's counsel contention that all the  stated  cases  cited  by  the  Appellant  are  distinguishable  under  the circumstances at hand as all those cases were challenging the jurisdiction of the Board in respect to refusal of waiver to pay one third or lesser amount which is a prerequisite before an objection is admitted by the Commissioner General. He submitted that in those cases the court had ruled that the Board had no jurisdiction due to the fact that as far as decisions from objection are

concerned, it was only upon receipt of the Final Determination of Objection can one approach the Board and not vice versa.

Responding to the second ground of appeal, Mr. Brian contended that the trial magistrate did not error by holding that the court had no jurisdiction, it was  his submission that according to section 53(1) of the Tax Administration Act, Cap. 428 R. E. 2019, the Plaintiff being aggrieved by the detention  of  his  motor  vehicle  by  the  Commissioner  General  (TRA),  was required to appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board. He said this was so because it is the Tax Revenue Appeals Board which has a sole jurisdiction in all proceedings of civil nature in respect of disputes arising from the revenue laws administered by the Tanzania Revenue Authority as per section 7 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, [Cap 408 RE 2019]

Responding to the issue that the trial magistrate based her decision on not pleaded facts or facts that needed to be ascertained. Mr. Brian contended that the point was not valid and that the reason for detaining his vehicle was correctly pleaded in the Written Statement of Defence which is due to the vehicle  having  an  identical  registration  number  with  another  vehicle. Therefore, the Appellant was required to pursue the matter before the Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board  and  not  to  file  his  Plaint  before  the  Resident

Magistrate Court. He concluded by praying this appeal be dismissed with the costs.

Rejoining the submission Ms. Justus reiterated her submission in chief and added that what was before the trial court was a pure abuse of office, where a citizen's chattel was improperly confiscated and never returned. It was also the learned counsel submission all cases cited by the respondent's counsel are distinguishable from the instant matter, because on those cases had the decision of the Commissioner General capable of being appealed before the Board which is not the case in the matter before this court. She insisted  further  that  without  a  decision  of  the  Commissioner  General  the Appellant  has  no  case  before  the  Board.  She  also  submitted  that  the circumstances of the Appellant were proper before the Trial Court and not the  Board.  On  the  strength  of  her  submission  Ms.  Justus  prayed  for  the appeal to be allowed.

I have thoroughly examined the trial court's record in relation to the grounds  of  appeal  raised  and  also  the  submissions  for  and  against  the appeal. In determining whether the appeal has merit or not I will consider the two grounds of appeal together as they both point to the issue as to whether the trial  court  had  jurisdiction  to  hear  the  matter.  Nevertheless,

which caused the trial court to lack jurisdiction is due to the objection raised by the respondent therein. In my view of the pleading at the trial court, I find very appropriate to consider whether the raised preliminary objection raised was pure point of law.

It  is  a  trite  law  that  preliminary  objections  must  meet  the  test of  a famous and celebrated case of Mukisa Biscuits Manufacturing Ltd. vs West  End  Distributors  Ltd ,  [1969]  1  EA  696  which  defines  what  a preliminary objection is and also provides when it can be raised and when it should not be raised. The principle in this case enshrines an objection to be termed as real preliminary objection must be on a pure point of law and not of fact. For ease of reference, I quote the position set out in Mukisa Biscuits case as hereunder:

"A preliminary objection is in the nature of what used to be a demurrer. It raises a pure point of law which is argued on the assumption that all the facts pleaded by the other side are correct. It cannot  be  raised  if  any  fact  has  to  be ascertained or if what is sought is the exercise of judicial discretion."

Having considered the Ruling of the District Court, with respect, the learned Senior Resident Magistrate reached the decision by relying on the pleading that the plaintiff purchased  a  second  hand/used  motor  vehicle  with registration No. T. 135 ANH make Toyota Hilux from another person and registered in his name. Later in 2015 he was informed by the respondent that  there  were  two  different  motor  vehicle  registration  cards  over  two different  motor  vehicles  with  the  same  registration  number,  thus  the respondent  detained  the  said  motor  vehicle  for  investigating  its  chases number after the appellant failure to present documents. The District court concluded the issue of registration is governed by the Motor Vehicle (Tax Registration and Transfer) Act Cap. 124 R.E 2019 and Road Traffic Act, Cap. 168 which are provided on list of laws administered by Tanzania Revenue Authority by virtue of section 5 (1) (a) of the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act (supra).

In  my  view  of  the  above  consideration  of  the  trial  court,  I  am  of considered opinion the said court misdirected itself to grasp the pure point of law as envisaged by the case above, I am saying this because those were facts to be proved later before the court, nonetheless the same cannot be

said in itself are conclusive. But also, the facts above do not protrude on the face of it any error on points of law raised as objection by the defendant.

This position was highlighted by the Court of Appeal in Sugar Board of Tanzania v. 21st Century Food and Packaging &amp; Two Others, Civil Application No. 20 of 2007 (unreported). When it observed that;

'A preliminary objection is in the nature of legal objection not based on the merits or facts of the case  but  on  the  stated  legal  procedural  or technical grounds. Such an objection must be argued  without  reference  to  evidence.  The fundamental  requirement  is  that  any  alleged irregular defect or default must be apparent  on  the  face  of  the  notice  of motion  so  that  the  objector  does  not condescend to affidavits or other documents  accompanying  the  motion  to support the objection.'

[ Emphasis supplied]

Thus, being guided by the principles laid down in above case, I now proceed with this appeal, by revisiting the objection raised at the District Court. To start  with  the  first  part  of  objection  the  respondent  at  the  trial  relied  his

objection under section 53 (1) of the Tax Administration Act (supra) provides that;

'Person  who  is  aggrieved  by  an  objection decision or other decision or omission of the Commissioner General under  this  Part may appeal to the Board in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act"

[ Emphasis added]

According to the Section 2 of the above Act which is interpretation section 'objection decision' means a decision in respect of a tax decision made  under  section  52;  However,  under  section  52  provides  that  the Commissioner  General  may,  upon  admission  of  an  objection  pursuant  to section  51,  make  a  decision  by  determining  the  objection  or  call  for  any evidence  or  any  other  information  as  may  appear  necessary  for  the determination  of  the  objection  and  may,  in  that  respect  amend  the assessment or other tax decisions in accordance with the objection and any further evidence that has been received.

Therefore, from the above law, for the above provision to apply must have been a tax decision issued under section 50(1) of the act, then the

appellant could have lodged his grievances to the Commissioner General by filing objection under section 51 (1) of the Act above.  In view of the above law as rightly pointed by appellant's counsel there must be a decision by the commissioner general for the appellant to go to the board to challenge it. I have  entirely  perused  the  pleading  no  decision  of  the  commissioner  was stated  or  shown,  and  if  there  is  any  need  to  be  ascertained  by  facts. Nonetheless what was stated in paragraph four of the written statement of the respondent about presence of two registration card over two different vehicles with the same registration number is not a decision as per above law, but rather are facts need to be ascertained by evidence to know whether the appellant has faulted any law or not, thus in whatever means cannot be objection on point of law as stated above.

In  respect  to  the  second  objection  the  respondent  alleged  the objection on the point law is based on Section 7 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act (supra) provides that;

"The Board shall have sole original jurisdiction in all proceedings of a civil nature in respect of disputes arising from the revenue  laws administered  by  the  Tanzania  Revenue Authority: "

## [ Emphasis added]

As stated above in respect to pleadings showing the cause of action, the  same  need  to  be  ascertained  by  facts  to  prove  as  to  whether  the respondent found any fault on part of Appellant in respect to revenue laws, also there is no evidence of any measures that were taken against appellant if at all there was fault on his part. In considering thereof, I am of considered opinion the issue whether revenue laws were breached cannot be settled automatically in above circumstances unless proved by ascertaining of facts at later stage which is contrary to the principle of Mukisa Biscuit said above.

Be it as it may, as observed above, if at all the Appellant was at fault there should have been evidence of measures taken against him and that could have been the decision of the Commissioner General from which the Appellant would have appealed against, therefore, since in the instant matter there was no decision to be appealed against, that is why the Appellant opted to file a normal civil suit to pursue his rights.

In light of what I have endeavoured to discuss above, I am settled the objection raised did not reflect a pure point of law in the above circumstances. I therefore  find this appeal meritorious and proceed to allow

it. Consequently, the ruling of the trial court is hereby quashed and set aside. I order the case file be remitted to the trial court for determination of the said  civil  case  no.1  of  2022  on  merit  before  another  Magistrate.  In  the circumstances I make no order of costs.

It is so ordered.

DATED at MOSHI this day of 18 th October, 2023.
