## RULING OF THE COURT

25th  March  &amp;  29th   April,  2019

## MUSSA, J.A.:

The referred two appeals involve the same parties just as they arose out  of the  same  transaction. When  the  appeals  were  separately  placed before us, the respective appellants were represented by Messrs Salvatory Switi and  Haspis  Maswanyia,  learned Advocates, whereas the respondents

had  the services  of  Messrs Gaudiosis Ishengoma  and  FAyaz  Bhojani,  also learned Advocates.

It is noteworthy that both appeals are greeted by identical  notices of preliminary points of objection. For instance,  following  some adjustments the notice in Civil Appeal No. 79 goes thus:-

- "(0 That  the  appellants  appeal  is  incompetent  for  contravening Rule 96 (2) read together with Rule 96 (1) (k) of the Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009  (as  amended). The  appellant  has  not included, the appellant's and the respondents written submissions filed at the  Tribunal which  were the basis of the decision in respect of Tax  Appeal No.  16 of  2013.
- (ii) The appellant's appeal is incompetent for including an incorrect copy  of  the  proceedings  of  the Tribunal. The  purported proceedings appearing at pages 508 to 557 of the record of appeal are  different or  contain  different matters  from  which were transacted during the proceedings at the Tribunal."

The  notice  in  Civil  Appeal  No.  78  is,  as  we  said,  identical  to  the foregoing notice save that, in item (i) reference is to "Tax Appeal No. 17 of

2013" whereas in  item  (ii),  reference is to "pages 692 to 761 and 763 to 773'.

Given the identical nature of the preliminary points of objection in the two appeals,  by  consensus,  counsel  from  either  side  were  agreed  and  it was  ordered  that the  hearing  of the  preliminary  points  of  objection  with respect to both appeals be consolidated.

Addressing  us on the first limb of the notice of preliminary points of objection  with  respect  to  both  appeals,  Mr,  Bhojani  submitted  that  the appellant omitted to include,  in the record of appeal, copies of the written submissions  which  were  lodged  by  the  parties  at  the  Tribunal. In  that regard,  in  an  effort  to  underscore  the  relevancy  of  the  documents,  the learned  counsel  painstakingly  referred  to  instances  in  which  the Tribunal referred the submissions in  its decision. In  sum,  Mr.  Bhojani  argued  that the  omitted  documents  are  relevant  for  the  proper  determination  of the appeal.  In the premises, the learned counsel for the respondent concluded that, upon numerous decisions, it is now settled that an incomplete record has the  effect of invalidating  an  appeal  and  he,  accordingly,  urged  us to strike out the appeal for incompetence.

To  buttress  his  stance,  the learned  counsel  for  the respondent brought  to  our  attention  the  unreported  decisions  of  the  Court  in  Civil Appeal  No.  8  of  2008  Fedha  Fund  Limited  and  Others  vs  George Vargese and Another; Civil Appeal  No.  26 of 2015 Kasanzu Lusasula vs  Lugito  Bulayi; Civil  Appeal  No.  140  of 2016 Ona  ukiro  Ulomi  vs Standard  Oil  Company  Ltd  and  Others; and  Civil  Appeal  No.  188  of 2016  Ali  Vuai  Ali  vs  Sued  Mzee  Sued. More  particularly,  in  the referred case of Fedha  Fund Limited the Court held that the decision to choose  documents  relevant  for  the  determination  of  the  appeal  is  not optional on the party filing the record of appeal. It is common ground that in   terms of Rule 96 (3) of the Rules, it is either a Judge or Registrar of the High Court or Tribunal who, on application  by a   party,  has to direct which documents be excluded from the record of appeal.

In  reply,  Mr.  Switi for the appellant informed  the Court that it is an established practice of the Tax Appeals Tribunal for it to reprint the written submissions  of  the  parties  and  consequently  append  the  same  in  the record of proceeding.  Thus, the written submissions which are reflected in the two records of appeal were duly reprinted by the Tribunal  upon  being filed  by the  parties. That being  so,  it was,  to  him,  quite  unnecessary for the appellant to additionally append copies of the submission in addition to the available versions which were  reprinted  by the Tribunal. In  sum,  the learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  contended  that  the  available  reprinted versions of the  submissions sufficiently meet the  requirements of Rule 96 (1) (k) of the Rules.

According to Mr.  Bhojani, the second limb of the preliminary points of objection is intrinsically related to the first limb in that they both boil down to  the  complaint  on  the  non-inclusion  of the  written  submissions  in  the record of appeal. To appreciate the gist of his contention,  it is necessary to  revisit  what  transpired  at  the  hearing  of the  two  appeals  before  the Tribunal.

To begin with Civil Appeal  No.  79 of 2018, the same originated from the Tribunal's Tax  Appeal  No.  16  of 2013  in  which  the  appellant and  the respondent herein appeared in that capacity. By consensus, counsel from either side agreed that the hearing of the appeal should proceed by way of written  submissions,  whereupon  the Tribunal  prescribed  a  time frame  for the  presentation  of the  written  submissions  which  was  duly  complied  by the parties. As it turns out, the written submissions of both  parties were

subsequently regenerated and appended  to  the  Tribunal's record of proceedings. The  regenerated written  submissions are reflected  at pages 508 to 557 of the record of Civil Appeal No. 79 of 2018.

A corresponding process was done with respect to Civil Appeal No. 78 of 2018 which originated  from  the Tribunal's Tax Appeal  No.  17 of 2013. The regenerated written submissions were posted in the Tribunal's record of  proceedings  and  the  same  are  reflected  at  pages  692  to  761  of the record of Civil Appeal No. 78 of 2018.

Mr.  Bhojani  urged  us to discount the written  submissions appended to the  Tribunal's  record of  proceedings  on account  that, apart  from contravening Rule 96 (1) of the Rules which imperatively require the record of appeal to contain "'copies "of the enumerated documents, the appended regenerated submissions are also fraught by mistakes and, above all, they do not contain the documents which were annexed to the submissions.  In the  premises,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  submitted  that  the regenerated submissions fall short and, as a  result, the record of appeal is invalidated for being incomplete.

In  reply,  Mr.  Switi  reiterated  his contention that the appellant found no cause to append copies of the written submissions in the record of the two  appeals  much  as  the  same  were  regenerated  by  the  Tribunal  and posted in the Tribunal's record of proceedings.  To him the requirements of Rules 96 (1) and (2) were fully met.  In the alternative, the learned counsel for  the  appellant  invited us  to  invoke  the  up  and  coming  overriding objective  principle and  direct the appellant to file  a  complete  record. To fortify this  prayer,  Mr.  Switi  sought reliance  in the  unreported  Civil Appeal No.  139  of  2017  CRDB  Bank  Limited  vs  Issack  Mwamasika  and Two Others.

.   The  alternative  prayer was  promptly faulted  by  Mr.  Bhojani  who,  in the first place, sought to distinguish CRDB Bank Limited (supra) with the situation  at  hand. In  the  referred  case,  he  said,  the  concern  was  over missing pages of a document that was already part of the record of appeal, whereas in the matter at hand, the concern is over the written submissions which  are  completely  missing. The  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent further submitted that the situation at hand  is closer to the one obtaining in  the  unreported  Civil  Appeal  No.  66  of  2017  Mondorosi  Village Council  and Two  Others vs Tanzania  Breweries  Limited  and  Four

Others. In  that  case,  the  concern  was  over  the  non-inclusion,  in  the record of appeal, of a   letter of an application for a  copy of proceedings in terms  of  the  proviso  to  Rule  90  (1)  of  the  Rules. As  it  were,  the respondent took a preliminary point of objection  urging the Court to strike out the  appeal  on  account  of the  missing  letter. For the  appellants,  an argument was taken, inter alia, inviting the Court to invoke the principle of overriding objective and dispense with the necessity of having the letter in the  record  of  appeal. In the  upshot,  the  Court  made  the  following observation

Regarding  the  overriding  objective  principlef we  are  of  the  considered  view  that ; the  same cannot  be  applied  blindly  against  the  mandatory provisions  of the procedural law  which  go  to  the very foundation of the case. This can be gleaned from  the  objects  and  reasons  of introducing  the principle under section 3 of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act  [Cap 141 R.E. 2002] as amended by the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No, 3) Act No. 8 of  2018,  which enjoins the Courts to do

away with technicalities and instead, shouid determine cases justly. According to the Bill to the amending Act, it was said thus:-

"The proposed  amendments  are not designed  to  blindly  disregard  the  rules  of procedure  that  are  couched  in  mandatory terms... "[Emphasis supplied].

In the  result,  the  appeal  was struck out. Mr.  Bhojani  has  urged  us not  to  depart  from  our  decision  in  the  referred  foregoing  case  and  to similarly strike out the two appeals under our consideration for incompetence.

We  have  dispassionately  considered  and  weighed  the  learned  rival contentions of both  counsel. Speaking  of the  raised  preliminary  points of objection,  we  entirely  subscribe  to  the  respondent's  complaint  that  the appellant did not meet the requirements of Rule 96 (1) (k) of the Rules.  It is  noteworthy that instead of appending copies of the written submissions made  by  the  parties  to  the  Tribunal,  the  appellant  sought  to  rely  upon versions  of the  submissions  which  were  reprinted  and  appended  to  the

Tribunal's record of proceedings. It is beyond question that the requirement of Rule 96  (1)  which  imperatively requires that the  record  of appeal should contain "copies "of the enumerated documents was not met. The vexing issue is whether or not the overriding objective principle can be called  into  play  to  cure  the  shortcoming  as  urged  by  counsel  for  the appellant.

To  begin  with, we entirely subscribe to the observation of the Court in the referred case of Mondorosi Village Council (supra). Nevertheless,  we  would  wish  to  distinguish  the  details  obtaining  in  that case from  the  particulars  at hand. As we  have  already intimated,  in  the former case, the concern was over a copy of a letter which was completely missing  from  the  record. Conversely, in the  situation at hand, the impugned written  submissions  are actually  reflected  in  the  records of the two appeals but the raised concern  is,  rather, that the same fall  short on account that the same do not meet the specific requirements of Rule 96 (1) of the Rules and, additionally, that the submissions are incomplete for want of its annextures.

Upon  our  mature  consideration,  we think that this  is  a  case  where the  Court  should  have  due  regard  to  the  need  to  achieve  substantive justice in line with Rule 2 of the Rules as it is our well considered view that the shortcomings we have pointed out should not lead to the drastic action of  invalidating  the  entire  record  of  appeal. Thus,  in  the  spirit  of  the overriding  objectives  of  the  Court  we,  accordingly,  grant  leave  to  the appellant to lodge the omitted copies of written submission  under Rule 96 (6)  within  twenty  one  (21)  days  from  the  date  of  this  Ruling. In  the meantime, the two appeals stand adjourned to a date to  be fixed  by the Registrar.  It is so ordered.
