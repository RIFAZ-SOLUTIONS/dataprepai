## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

3d &amp; 2&amp;h  June, 2022

## MKUYE, J.A,:

In this appeal, the  appellant Dominion  Tanzania Limited, is challenging  the  decision  and  decree  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  (henceforth  "the  TRAT")  dated  2n d   December,  2020  in   Tax Appeal  No.  54 of 2019 which  upheld the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (henceforth "the TRAB") in Tax Appeal No.  1 3 5  of 2013 dated 3r d  April, 2 0 1 9 .

The facts of this case can be briefly stated as follows:

The appellant is a  company incorporated in the United Republic of Tanzania  (URT) dealing in oil and gas exploration. It operates in one offshore exploration block (Block 7) in Tanzania.  Its operation involves acquisition  of  raw  seismic  data  from  the  exploration  location  by  a contractor based in Tanzania then sends the raw data oversees mostly at  London  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  processing, production  and interpretation of the said seismic data together with developing drilling programmes which are sent to the appellant in order for them to engage a  sub-contractor to  undertake the drilling  programme  in  Tanzania.  In doing this, the appellant was charged fees on the basis of time spent by each entity in the process.

On 11t h November, 2013  the  Commissioner  General of  the Tanzania  Revenue Authority (the respondent) issued a withholding tax certificate  with  a   liability  of  Tshs. 1,089,269,761/=.  The  tax  liability resulted from payments made by the appellant to a company conducting its affairs in  the United Kingdom  as fees for processing and interpreting seismic data  as according  to the  respondent the said  payments were subject to imposition of withholding tax as so imposed.

On the other hand, the appellant claimed that the said payments were  not  liable  to  withholding  tax  and  upon  being  aggrieved  by  the decision of the Commissioner General, she appealed to the TRAB. Upon hearing  both  parties,  the  TRAB  found  in  favour  of  the  respondent holding that the payments made to a non-resident by a resident having a  source  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania  (URT)  was  subject  to withholding tax.

Dissatisfied  b y   the  TRAB's  decision,  the  appellant  appealed  to TRAT but his appeal  was dismissed.  In  upholding the TRAB's decision the TRAT held that irrespective of the place of rendering the services, as the  payments  were  made  by  the  appellant  for  services  utilized  in Tanzania  then  the  payments  m ade to  non-resident had  a  source  in URT and, therefore, are subject to withholding tax as per section 6 (1) (b), 69 (i) (i) and 8 3  (1) (b) of the Income Tax 2004 (the ITA 2004). It went on to hold that the Finance Act 2020 did not change the position of  the  law  in   section  6 9   (i)  of  the  ITA  2 0 0 4 .  Still  undaunted,  the appellant has now appealed to this Court on two grounds of appeal as follows:

' 1) That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in  law  in  holding  that irrespective  of place  of

rendering  services  as  payment  in  this  appeal were made by the appellant for services utilized in  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania, then  the payments  made  by  the  appellant  for  services performed outside Tanzania by non-resident and therefore are  subject  to withholding tax  under the provisions of  section 6(1) (b), 69 (i) (i) and  83 (1) (b) of  the  Income Tax  Act, 2004.

2)  The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law to hold that the Finance Act 2020 has not changed the position of  the law in section 69 (1) (sic) of  the Income Tax Act, 2004 and therefore the position in Commissioner General TRA vs. Pan African  Energy, Civil Appeal No.  146 of 2015  is  not  relevant  to the appeal  at  hand".

At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was represented by M r. Wilson Kamugisha Mukebezi, learned advocate whereas, the respondent enjoyed  the  services  of  M r.  Harold  Gugami  and  M s.  Fatm a  Abdallah, both learned Senior State Attorneys.

Ahead of the hearing, both parties filed written submissions as per Rule 106 (1) and (8) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009 which during  hearing,  they  each  sought  to  adopt  to  form  part  of  their submissions.

Submitting  in  support  of the  appeal,  M r.  Mukebezi  took  off  by stating  that  the  dispute  was  very  simple  on  whether  the  services rendered outside the  URT by  non-resident was subject to payment of withholding tax in view of the respondent's stance that as the end result of  services  rendered  was  utilized  in   the  URT,  they  were  subject  to withholding tax. He contended that, under the law as it used to be the non-residents were  not required to  pay withholding tax. This was the position  taken  in  the  case  of Commissioner General, TRA v.  Pan African  Energy  Tanzania  Limited, Civil  Appeal  N o. 146  of  2015 (unreported) where it was held that:

" . . . This is not the case with section 69 (i) (i). A private  company  like  the  respondent  has  no obligation to withhold tax where the services fee paid  were  for  services  rendered  outside  the country."

In the same case, the Court went further to hold that:

"The construction of the section was tied to the place  where  services  for  the  respondent  were rendered. Services were  rendered  in United Kingdom  by  persons  resident  in the United Kingdom.  Section  69  (i)  (i)  does  not  impose liability on an individual company to withhold tax

where service fee is paid in relation to services rendered out of  the United Republic regardless of the  fact that payment is  made  by a  company registered in and  it is doing business in Tanzania..."

This also answers the issues that were raised by the parties that the payments that were made by the respondents to non-resident consultants were not  liable for withholding tax".

Mr.  Mukebezi  argued  further  that  the  position  was  changed  in Tullow Tanzania BV v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal  N o .  2 4  of 2 0 1 8   (unreported)  where the Court while adopting a purposive approach in interpreting section 69 (i)  (i)  of the ITA, 2004  held that irrespective of the place of rendering services,  as the payment was made by a  person  resident in Tanzania, for services utilized in the United Republic, then the payments m ade are subject to withholding tax under the provisions of sections 6(1) (b), 69 (i) (i) and 8 3  (1 ) (b) of  the ITA, 2 0 0 4 .

It  was  therefore  his  submission  that,  since  in  this  case  the payments were made before the law was amended, the interpretation adopted by the TRAT was wrong.  He referred us to the case of BIDCO

Oil and Soap Ltd. v. Commissioner General TRA, Civil Appeal  N o . 89 of 2009 (unreported) in which the Court while citing the case of Yew Bon Tew v. Kndraan Bas Mar (1983) 1  AC 553 stated that:

".. . t h e r e  is at c o m m o n  law a prima facie rule of construction that statute should not be interpreted  retrospectively  so  as  to  impair  an existing right or obligation  unless  that result is unavoidable on the language used..."

In that regard, he urged the Court to find that the changes in law did not apply to the appellant and insisted that the payments made by the appellant to the non-residents for services rendered outside the URT were not subject to payment of withholding tax.  He therefore, implored the Court to allow the appeal with costs.

In  response,  M r.  Gugam i,  apart from  the  written  submission  he had sought to adopt earlier on, agreed with Mr Mukebezi on the position of the  law  before  the  decision  in  the  case  of Tullow Tanzania  BV (supra) and the amendment of section 69 (i) (i) vide the Finance 2020 (Act  N o .  8   of  2 0 2 0 )   in   that  it  w a s  a s  w as  h e ld   in   the  case  of Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited (supra) in which it was emphasized that payment to non-residents had no source of payment from the URT as services were rendered outside the URT.

Nevertheless, the learned counsel argued that the case of Tullow Tanzania  BV (supra)  distinguished  the case of Pan African  Energy Tanzania Limited (supra) because in the latter case the decision was based  on  the  interpretation  of  section  9  (1)  (vii)  (c)  of  the  Indian Income  Tax  Act  to  arrive  at  its  finding  considering  it  to  be  in pari materia with  section  69  (i)  (i)  of  the  ITA  2004  while  they  are  quite different.

He went on to submit that in 2018, the same issue resurfaced in Tullow Tanzania BV (supra) where it was held that sections 68 and 6 9 of ITA were meant to cater for cross border payments and that they are anti-avoidance  provisions i n as  far  as cross-border  payments  are concerned  in  respect  of  place  of  rendering  the  services.  It  was  his further argument that the amendment through Act No. 8  of 2020 did not change the law as the amendments were meant to clarify the position taken  in Tullow Tanzania  BV's case (supra) which  was followed  by other cases in that service rendered or delivered outside the URT which is utilized or consumed in the URT is subject to withholding tax. He went

on  submitting that as of now the  payment for services  provided  by a non-resident to a resident of URT who is a payer for such service with the source from URT is subject to withholding tax.

Mr. Gugami further dismissed the appellant's attempt to m ove this Court to depart from Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra) and restore the decision of the case of in Pan African Energy (supra). He stressed that i n   t e r m s   of  s e c t io n   6 9   ( i )   ( i )   of  IT A  2 0 0 4 , payments  have  source  in Tanzania if a  non-resident transmits/delivers services in Tanzania. In the end,  he implored the Court to find that the appeal  is not merited and dismiss it with costs.

In  rejoinder,  M r.  Mukabezi  contended  that  the  position  in Pan African Energy Limited (supra) was the correct position arguing that even the amendment of 2020 was in compliance with what was said in that case.  H e also insisted that the law must be strictly interpreted. H e then beseeched the Court to allow the appeal with costs.

We  have  examined  the  entire  record  of appeal,  the  grounds of appeal and both written and oral submissions from both sides and, we think,  the  m ain  issues  for  this  Court's  determination  are  two. One, whether the payments made by a resident person in the URT to a non­

resident person outside the URT for services rendered outside the URT are subject to withholding tax in terms of section 6(1) (b), 69 (i) (i) and 83  (1)  (b)  of  the  ITA,  2004,  as  opposed  to  the  purported  issue, proposed by the appellant's advocate in the written submission "whether the TRAT was  right  in  law  when  it  held  that  payments  m ade  by the appellant to non-resident persons for services rendered outside Tanzania are liable to withholding tax as per section 6(1) (b), 69 (i) (i) and 83 (1) (b) of ITA 2004" as we think, the TRAT did not m ake any determination to that effect. Two, whether the Finance Act 2020 did not change the position of the law in section 69 (i) (i) of the ITA 2004.

With  regard  to  the  first  issue,  our  starting  point  would  be  to restate the provisions relevant to this issue. Section 6  (1) (b) of the ITA 2004  provides for the  income  which  is  chargeable to  non-resident as follows:

"6 (1) Subject  to the  provisions of  subsection (2), the chargeable income of  a person for a year of i ncome from any  employment, business or investment  shall  be -

- ( a ) ........
- (b) in the case of  a non-resident  person, the  persons  income  from  the  employment

## business  or  investment  for  the  year  of i n c o m e ,   but only to the extent that the income  has  a  source  in  the  United Republic. "[Emphasis added]

According to the above cited provision of the law, the emphasis is placed  on  the  source  of  income,  in   that,  payment to  a   non-resident would be subject to taxation if the payment has a source in the United Republic of  Tanzania.

On the other hand, section 69 (i) (i) of the ITA 2004 elaborates payments with a source of payment in the United Republic of Tanzania as follows:

"69.  The following  payments  have a source in the United  Republic -

(a) to (h). . .

(i) payments, including service fee, of  a type not  mentioned  in  paragraphs (g) or  (h) or  attributable  to  employment  exercised, service rendered or a forbearance from exercising employment or rendering service -

(i) in  the  United Republic,  regardless of the place of  payment, or ..." [Emphasis added]

As regards section 83 (1) (b) of the ITA 2004, it puts an obligation of withholding tax on payments m ade to non-residents specifically if the source  of payment is  in  the  URT.  For clarity,  we  reproduce  the  said provision as hereunder:

"83  (1)  Subject to  subsection  (2), a  resident person who -

( a )   . .....

(b) pays a service fee or an insurance premium with  a source  in  the  United Republic to a non-resident person shall withhold i ncome tax from the payment at the rate provided for in paragraph 4 (c) of  the First Scheduled. " [ E m phasis added]

Luckily  enough,  this  Court  had  an  opportunity of considering  all these provisions of the law in the case of Tullow Tanzania BV (supra) and observed as follows:

"Reading sections 6 (1) (b), 69 (i) (i) and 83 (1) (b) all  together  gives  two conditions  for  a payment to  a  non-resident to  be  subjected to withholding tax. These are:

(1)  The services of which  the payment is made  must  be  rendered  in  the  United Republic of Tanzania, and (2) the payment should have a source In the United  Republic of  Tanzania."

The Court went on to say that under section 83 (1) (b) of the ITA 2004,  the withholding  obligation  applies to a   payment for service fee with a source in the United Republic of  Tanzania and section 69 explains what  payment  have  a  source  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania.  A similar position was taken in  numerous cases. Just to mention a few, they include Shell Deep Water Tanzania BV v. The Commissioner General TRA, Civil Appeal No.  1 2 3  of 2 0 1 8 ; Commissioner General TRA v.  Aggreko  International  Projects Limited, Civil  Appeal  N o . 148 of 2018; Ophir Tanzania (Block 1) Limited v. Commissioner General TRA, Civil  Appeal  N o .  5 8   of 2 0 2 0 ;   and Geita Gold  Mining Limited v. Commissioner General Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 9  of 2019 (all unreported).

Mr.  Mukebezi  has  invited  the  Court  to  rely  on Pan  African Energy Company  Limited's case  (supra)  in  which  the  Court  while relying  on  the  interpretation  of  section  9   (1 )  (vii)  (c)  of  the  Indian Income Tax Act had interpretated section 69 (i) (i) of the ITA 2004 to

the effect that a  private company had no obligation to withhold tax if  the services fees paid were for services rendered outside the country as in his view is a  good law .  However, we think, the position on this matter is now well settled following the decision in Tullow Tanzania BV (supra) where the Court interpreted the said provision and stated that:

"It is our strong view that the word "rendered" used under section  69 (i)  (i) is synonymous to words "supplied"  or "delivered".  In this regard, a non-resident has delivered  /  supplied services to a  resident of the  United Republic of Tanzania. The recipient of the service is actually the payer  for  such  services,  in which  case " source  of payment" cannot be any other place except where the payer resides. In other words, as the services of which the payments  were  made  were  consumed or utilized  by  the  appellant  in the  United Republic of Tanzania for purposes of earning income in the United Republic, the payments  made  for such  services  had  a source in the United Republic of Tanzania, and  the  respondent had  to  withhold  tax under  section 83 (1) (c) of  the  Act...

From  the  above  therefore, the  respondent's learned counsel is right in inviting this Court to opt for a purposive approach which would derive this  Court  into  upholding  the  decision  by  the Tribunal in the case at hand, that irrespective of the place of rendering services,  as the payment was made by a person resident in Tanzania, for services utilized in the United Republic, then  the  payments  made  are subject to withholding tax under the provisions of  sections 6 (1) (b), (69) (i) (i) and  83  (1)  (b)  of  the  Income  Tax  Act 2004". [Emphasis added]

This  position  of  the  law  was  followed  by  a   number  of  cases enumerated earlier particularly in relation to the interpretation of section 69  (i)  (i)  of the  ITA  2 0 0 4 .  For  instance,  in Aggreko International Projects Limited's case (supra) when the Court was faced with akin scenario it had this to sa y :

'We firmly subscribe to the position held by this Court as  expounded  in Tullow  Tanzania  BV case  (supra)  a  position  also  adopted in Shell Deep Water Tanzania BV (supra) on the issue of "the source" and "service rendered" and also where it was  stated  that as the recipient  of  the

## service is the actual  payer for such service,

## "the source of  payment" " has to be where the  payer  resided". [Emphasis added]

Although  in  the opinion  of the appellant the decision  in Tullow Tanzania  BV's case is bad  law, on the contrary,  it is our considered view that is correct position of the law to which we subscribe.

We are mindful of the fact that M r. Mukebelezi also beseeched the Court to depart from the decision in Tullow Tanzania BV (supra) and adopt the decision in Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited (supra) which according to him  is the right position of the law .

Incidentally,  we  note  that  this  is  not  the  first  time  when  this argument  is  advanced  to  this  Court  in  similar  circumstances.  It  was advanced  in  the  cases  of National  Microfinance  Bank  Limited v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 168 of  2018 and Ophir  Tanzania (Block  1) Limited  v. Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 58 of 2020 (both unreported).  In the latter case, the Court adopted what was decided in Tullow Tanzania BV's case (supra) to which we equally subscribe and stated as follows:

"We  just  as well  subscribe to the reasoning of  the Court in distinguishing from it the case of Pan African Energy (supra). That  being the position,  we find no cause to embrace the appellant's invitation to us to depart from the  decision  in Tullow. We  note  that, of recent,  a  corresponding stance  was adopted by the Court in unreported Civil Appeal No.  123 of 2018 Shell  Deep Water  Tanzania  BV  v . Commissioner  General  (TRA)". [Emphasis added]

Also,  the  Court  in Ophir Tanzania  (Block  1)  Limited (supra) went  further  to  find  out  that  the  decision  in Pan  African  Energy Tanzania  Limited (supra) was  correctly  distinguished in Tullow Tanzania BV's case (supra) and proceeded to decline the invitation by the  appellant  to  depart  from Tullow Tanzania  BV  Case (supra)  in favour of Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited, as good law. More importantly  the Court  not  only  found that  that  was  the correct interpretation of the law.  (See also Aggreko International Projects Limited (supra)).

On our part, applying the above cited authorities, we decline the invitation  from  the  appellant's  counsel  to depart from  the decision  of

Tullow  Tanzania  BV (supra)  in  favour  of Pan  African  Energy Limited (supra)  as  we  are  satisfied  that  the  interpretation  of  the provisions relating to payment of withholding tax to non-residents m ade in Tullow Tanzania  BV (supra) was correct and therefore good  law. We wish to reiterate that there is no error in the said interpretation of the law and we see no convincing argument to warrant us to do so.

Consequently,  since the circumstances of this case are similar to those  which  obtained  in Tullow  Tanzania  BV (supra), Aggreko International Projects Limited (supra) and Ophir Tanzania (Block 1) Limited (supra) we are of a settled mind that the TRAT was correct to  hold  that  payments  m ade  by  a   resident  person  in   URT to  a  non­ resident person outside the URT for services rendered outside URT and utilized  in  URT were liable for withholding tax.  In this regard,  we find that the 1 s t  ground of appeal is unmerited and we hereby dismiss it.

As regards the second issue relating to the amendment of section 69  (i) of  the  ITA  2004  through  the  Finance  Act  2020,  it  was  M r. Mukebezi's argument that since it changed the law, it could not operate retrospectively as was held in BIDCO Oil and Soap Limited (supra). On the other hand, Mr. Gugami countered that argument by contending

that the amendment of section 69 (i) (i) through Act No 8  of 2020 was intended to make the provision clearer than it was before.  We think this issue should not detain us m uch.

In  the  first  place,  we  agree  with  M r. Mukebezi  on  the  wellestablished principle  of  the law  that  the  law  should not  operate retrospectively. This position  is well stipulated  under Article  1 3 8   (1) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, [Cap 2  R.E. 2002] which states:

"No  tax of any kind shall be  imposed save  in accordance with a law enacted by Parliament or pursuant to a procedure lawfully prescribed and ■havin g  the force of  law  by virtue of  a law  enacted by the Parliament".

Yet, amplifying on the same issue in the case of BIDCO Oil and Soap Limited (supra) which was rightly cited by Mukebezi, this Court stated that:

"Apart  from the  provisions of  the interpretation of statutesthere is at common law a prima facie rule of  construction that statute should not be interpreted retrospectively so as to impair an  existing  right  or obligation unless  that

result is  unavoidable  on  that language  used..." [Emphasis added].

In this case, we are aware that in order to clarify the meaning of "service  rendered"  under  section  69  (i)  (i)  of  the  ITA  the  law  was amended  twice  as  was  correctly  submitted  by  both  counsel. It  was firstly  amended  in  2016  through  the  Finance  Act,  2016  whereby  the term "service rendered" was defined to m ean "transmitting or delivering of service in the United Republic of Tanzania irrespective of the place of performance of service". In 2020, through the Finance Act 2020 (Act No. 8 of 2020) section 69 (i) (i) was again amended as follows:

"The Principal  Act  is  amended:

- (a) by deleting sub  paragraph (i) and  substituting for  it  the following:
- (i)  irrespective  of  the  place  of exercise, rendering or forbearance and;
- (ii) regardless of place of payment: Provided that, the services are consumed in the United  Republic
- (c) by  renaming  sub  paragraph  (ii)  as  sub paragraph (Hi)".

As it is, our examination of the decision in Tullow Tanzania BV's case  (supra)  and  amendment  by  virtue  of  Act  No.  8  of  2020  has revealed that the said amendments amplified the law as it then was by stipulating  clearly  that  the  services  rendered  or  delivered  by  a   non­ resident irrespective of the place where they are rendered, provided that such  services  are  utilized  or  consumed  in  the  URT  are  subject  to withholding tax. This goes in tandem with what was stated in Tullow Tanzania BV case (supra) that:

"...that irrespective of the place of rendering  services,  as  the  payment  was made by a person resident in Tanzania, for services  utilized  in  the  United  Republic, then  the  payments  made  are  subject  to withholding  tax  under  the  provisions  of sections 6 (1) (b), (69) (i) (i) and  83 (1) (b) of  the  Income  Tax  Act  2004". [Emphasis added]

In this regard, as the said amendments were just meant to clarify the  position  of the  law  that  payments  m ade  by  a  resident to  a   non­ resident  for  services  rendered  outside  the  URT  for  consumption  in United  Republic Tanzania  are subject to withholding tax,  it cannot be

said that it changed the law .  And, therefore, we are settled in our m ind that the TRAT was right to hold that the amendments made in 2016 and 2020 did not change the position of the law.

With  the foregoing,  we find  that the appeal  is devoid  of  m erit. We, accordingly, dismiss it with costs.
