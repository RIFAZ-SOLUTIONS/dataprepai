Where  any  practice  of  the  Customs relating  to  the  classification  or  enumeration  of any goods for the purposes of the liability to duty is altered with the result that less duty is thereafter charged on goods of the same class or description, no person shall thereby become entitled  to  any  refund  of  any  duty  paid  before such alteration took effect.

117. -(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, where any duty or part of it has been short-levied or erroneously remitted, refunded, or rebate allowed in respect of it,  the  person  who  should  have  paid  the  amount short-levied or to whom the refund, remission or rebate  has  been  erroneously  allowed  shall,  on demand  by  the  Commissioner-General,  pay  the amount  short-levied  or  remitted,  or  repay  the amount erroneously refunded or rebate allowed in respect of it, as the case may be; and such amount shall be a debt due to the Government which may be recovered as civil debt by a suit at the instance of the Commissioner-General.

(2) Where a demand is made for any amount pursuant  to  subsection  (1),  the  amount  shall  be deemed to be due from the person liable to pay it on the date on which the demand note is served upon  him,  and  if  payment  is  not  made  within thirty  days  of  the  date  of  such  service,  a  further duty  of  a  sum  equal  to  five per  centum of  the amount  demanded  shall  be  due  and  payable  by that person by way of a penalty and a subsequent

penalty  of  two per  centum per  each  month  for which he defaults to pay.

- (3)  No  amount  of  duty  shall  be  recovered under this section after the expiration of thirty-six months from the date of the short-levy on erroneous refund, remission or rebate, as the case may  be, unless that short-levy or erroneous refund, remission or rebate is considered to have been caused by fraud or negligence on the part of the  person  from  whom  it  is  proposed  to  recover the duty.

Samples may be taken without immediate payment of duty

## PART I VALUE OF IMPORTED GOODS LIABLE TO AD VALOREM IMPORT DUTY

1. -(1) In this Schedule-

'customs value of imported goods' means the value of goods for the purposes  of  levying ad valorem duties of customs on imported goods;

'identical goods' means goods which  are the same  in all respects, including physical characteristics, quality and reputation.  Minor  differences in appearance shall not preclude goods otherwise conforming  to  the  definition from being regarded as identical;

'identical goods' and 'similar goods' do not include, as the case may  be, goods  which incorporate or reflect engineering, development, art-work, design work, and plans  and  sketches  for  which no adjustment has been made under subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) or  paragraph  9  because  such elements  were  undertaken  in Tanzania;

<!-- image -->

'produced' includes grown, manufactured and mined;

'similar goods' means goods which,  although  not  alike  in all respects, have like

characteristics and like component materials which enable  them  to  perform  the same functions and to be commercially interchangeable. The quality of the goods, their reputation and the existence  of  a  trademark  are among the factors to be considered in determining whether goods are similar.

- (2)  For  the  purposes  of  this Schedule-

(a)

goods shall not be regarded as 'identical goods' or 'similar goods'  unless  they  were produced in the same country as the goods being valued.

(c) Goods  produced  by  different persons shall be taken into account only when there are no identical goods or similar goods, as the case may  be, produced by the same person as the goods being valued.

<!-- image -->

- (3)  For  the  purposes  of  this Schedule, persons shall be deemed to be related only if:
- (a) they are officers or directors of one another's businesses;
- (b) they are legally recognised partners in business;

Transaction value

- (c) they  have  an  employer and employee relationship;
- (d) any person directly or indirectly  owns,  controls or  holds  five  percent  or more  of  the  outstanding voting stock or shares of both of them;
- (e) one  of  them  directly  or indirectly controls the other;
- (f)     both of them are directly or indirectly controlled by a third person;

together they directly control a third person; or they  are  members  of  the same family.

(4) Any  person who associates with  another  person  in  business, such  that  one  is  the  sole  agent, distributor  or  sole  concessionaire, however  described,  of  the  other shall  be  deemed  to  be  related  for the  purposes  of  this  Schedule  if they fall within the criteria of subparagraph 3.

<!-- image -->

2. -(1) The customs value of imported goods shall be the transaction value, which is the price  actually  paid  or  payable  for the  goods  when  sold  for  export  to Tanzania  adjusted  in  accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9, but where-

- (a) there  are  no  restrictions as  to  the  disposition  or use  of  the  goods  by  the buyer other than restrictions which:
- (i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in Tanzania;
- (ii) limit the geographical area in which the goods may be re-sold; or
- (iii)  do not substantially affect the value of the goods;

<!-- image -->

the  sale  or  price  is  not subject to some condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined  with  respect to the goods being valued;

- (d) no  part  of  the  proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the goods  by  the  buyer  will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment  can  be  made in accordance  with  the provisions  of  paragraph 9; and

<!-- image -->

- (d) the  buyer  and  seller  are not related, or where the buyer and seller are related, that the transaction value is acceptable for customs purposes under the provisions of subparagraph (2).
- (2) In determining whether the  transaction  value  is  acceptable for  the  purposes  of  subparagraph (1), the fact that the buyer and the seller are related within the meaning of paragraph (1) shall not in  itself  be  a  ground  for  regarding the transaction value as unacceptable. In such case the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided  that  the  relationship  did not  influence  the  price.  If,  in  the light  of  information  provided  by the importer or otherwise, the proper officer has grounds for considering that the relationship influenced the price, he shall communicate  his  grounds  to  the importer and such importer shall be given  a  reasonable  opportunity  to respond and where the importer so requests, the communication of the grounds shall be in writing;
- (3) In the sale between related persons, the transaction value shall be  accepted  and  the  goods  valued in  accordance  with  the  provisions

of  subparagraph  (1)  whenever  the importer demonstrates that such value  closely  approximates  to  one of  the  following  occurring  at  or about the same time:

- (a) the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers  of  identical  or similar goods for export to Tanzania;
- (b) the customs  value  of identical or similar goods  are  determined under the provisions of paragraph 6;
- (c) the customs  value  of identical or similar goods as determined under the provisions of paragraph 7:

Provided that, in applying the provisions  under  subparagraph  (2) (a)  and  (b)  of  this  paragraph,  due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the elements enumerated in paragraph  9  and  costs  incurred  by the  seller in sales in which  the seller and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales  in  which  the  seller  and  the buyer are related.

The tests set forth in subparagraph (2)(b) are to be used at the initiative of the importer and only for comparison purposes. Substitute values may not be

Transaction value of identical goods

<!-- image -->

established under the provisions of subparagraph (2)(b).

- 3. -(1) Where the customs value of  the  imported  goods  cannot  be determined under the provisions of paragraph 2, the customs value shall  be  the  transaction  value  of identical  goods  sold  for  export  to Tanzania and exported at or about the  same  time  as  the  goods  being valued;
- (2) In applying this paragraph, the transaction value of identical  goods  in  a  sale  at  the same commercial level and in substantially  the  same  quantity  as the  goods  being  valued  shall  be used to determine the customs value  and  where  no  such  sale  is found, the transaction value of identical  goods  sold  at  a  different commercial  level  or  in  different quantities, adjusted to take account of differences attributable to commercial  level  or  to  quantity, shall  be  used,  provided  that  such adjustments  can  be  made  on  the basis of demonstrated evidence which clearly establishes the reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustment, whether the adjustment leads  to  an  increase  or  a  decrease in the value.
- (3) Where the costs and charges referred to in subparagraph (2)  of  paragraph  9  are  included  in the transaction value, an adjustment  shall  be  made  to  take

Where  the  custom  value  of  the goods cannot be determined

<!-- image -->

account  of  significant  differences in such costs and charges between the imported goods and the identical  goods  in  question  arising from  differences  in  distances  and modes of transport.

- (4) Where  in  applying  this paragraph, more than one transaction value of identical goods is found,  the  lowest  such  value shall be used to determine the customs value of the imported goods.
- imported 4. -(1)Where the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under the provisions of  paragraph 2 and 3, the customs value shall be the transaction value of similar goods sold for export to Tanzania and exported at or about the  same  time  as  the  goods  being valued;
- (2) In applying this paragraph, the transaction value of similar goods in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially  the  same  quantity  as the  goods  being  valued  shall  be used to determine the customs value  and  where  no  such  sale  is found, the transaction value of similar  goods  sold  at  a  different commercial  level  or  in  different quantities, adjusted to take account of differences attributable to commercial  level  or  to  quantity, shall  be  used,  provided  that  such

adjustments  can  be  made  on  the basis of demonstrated evidence which clearly establishes the reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustment, whether the adjustment leads  to  an  increase  or  a  decrease in the value.

- (3) Where the costs and charges referred to in subparagraph (2)  of  paragraph  9  are  included  in the transaction value, an adjustment  shall  be  made  to  take account  of  significant  differences in such costs and charges between the imported goods and the similar goods in question arising from differences in distances and modes of transport.

(4)  Where,  in  applying  this paragraph, more than one transaction, value of similar goods is found,  the  lowest  such  value shall be used to determine the customs value of the imported goods.

<!-- image -->

Determination of value when transaction value is not available

- 5. Where the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under the provisions of paragraph 2, 3 and 4, the customs value shall be determined under the provisions of paragraph 6 or, if the customs value cannot be determined  under  that  paragraph, under the provisions of paragraph 7 save  that, at the request  of the importer, and with the approval of the proper officer, the order of application  of  paragraphs  6  and  7 shall be reversed.

Deductive value

6. -(1) Where the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are sold in Tanzania in the condition as imported, the customs value of the imported goods under the provisions  of  this  paragraph  shall be based on the unit price at which the  imported  goods  or  identical  or similar imported goods are so sold in  the  greatest  aggregate  quantity, at or about the time of the importation of the goods being valued, to persons  who  are  not related  to  the  persons  from  whom they  buy  such  goods,  subject  to deductions for the following:

<!-- image -->

- (a) either  the  commissions usually  paid  or  agreed to be paid or the additions  usually  made for profit and  general expenses  in  connection with  the  sales  in  such country of imported goods of the same class or kind;
- (b) the usual costs of transport  and  insurance and associated costs incurred within Tanzania;
- (c) where  appropriate,  the costs and charges referred to in subparagraph (3) of paragraph 9; and

- (d) the  customs  duties  and other national taxes payable  in  Tanzania  by reason of the importation  or  sale  of the goods;
- (2) Where neither the imported  goods  nor  identical  nor similar  imported goods are sold at or about the time of importation of the goods being valued, the customs value shall, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (1), be based on the unit price at which the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are sold in Tanzania in the condition as imported  at  the  earliest  date  after the importation of the goods being valued but before the expiration of 90 days after such importation.
- (3) Where neither the imported  goods  nor  identical  nor similar imported goods are sold in Tanzania in the condition as imported,  then,  if  the  importer  so requests,  the  customs  value  shall be based on the unit price at which the  imported  goods,  after  further processing, are sold in the greatest aggregate  quantity  to  persons  in Tanzania who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods,  due  allowance  being  made for the value added by such processing and the deductions provided for in subparagraph (1)

Computed value Cap.4 s.8

- 7. -(1)  The  customs  value  of imported goods under the provisions  of  this  paragraph  shall be based on a computed  value which shall consist of the sum of:
- (a) the cost or value of materials  and  fabrication or other processing employed  in producing the imported goods;
- (b) an amount for profit and general expenses equal to  that  usually  reflected in  sales  of  goods  of  the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers  in  the  country of exportation for export to Tanzania;
- (d) the cost or value of all other expenses necessary to reflect the costs added under subparagraph (2) of paragraph 9.
- (2)  No  person not  resident  in Tanzania may be required or compelled to produce for examination, or to allow access to, any account or other record for the purposes of determining a computed value. Provided that, information supplied by the producer of the goods for the purposes of determining the customs value under the provisions

<!-- image -->

Fallback method of  this  paragraph  may  be  verified in another country by a proper officer  with  the  Schedule  of  the producer  and  provided  sufficient advance notice is given to the government of the country in question  and  the  latter  does  not object to the investigation.

- 8. -(1)  Where  the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under the provisions of paragraph 2 through 7, inclusive,  the  customs  value  shall be determined using reasonable means consistent with the principles  and  general  provisions of this Schedule and on the basis of data available in Tanzania.
- (2) No customs value shall be determined under the provisions of this paragraph on the basis of:
- (a) the selling price in Tanzania of goods produced in Tanzania;
- (b) a  system which provides for the acceptance for customs  purposes  of  the higher of two alternative values;
- (c) the price of goods on the domestic  market  of  the country of exportation;
- (e) the  cost  of  production other than computed values which have been determined for identical or similar

Adjustment for costs and services

<!-- image -->

goods in accordance with  the  provisions  of paragraph 7;

- (e) the price of the goods for export to a country other than Tanzania;
- (f)    minimum customs values; or
- (g) arbitrary or fictitious values.
- (3) Where  the importer so requests,  he  shall  be  informed  in writing of the customs value determined under the provisions of this paragraph and the method used to determine such value.
- 9. -(1) In determining the customs value under the provisions of paragraph 2, there shall be added to the price actually paid or payable for the  imported goods as follows:
- (a) to  the  extend  that  they are incurred by the buyer but  are  not  included  in the price actually paid or payable for the goods-
- (i) the  commissions  and brokerage, except buying commissions;
- (ii) the cost of containers which  are  treated  as being one for customs purposes with the goods in question;

- (iii)  the  cost  of  packing whether for labour or materials;
- (b) the value, apportioned as appropriate, of the goods and services where supplied directly or indirectly  by  the  buyer free of charge or at reduced  cost  for  use  in connection with the production  and  sale  for export of the imported goods,  to  the  extent  that such  value  has  not  been included in the price actually  paid  or  payable as follows-
- (i) materials, components, parts and similar items incorporated  in  the imported goods;
- (ii)  tools, dies, moulds and similar items used in the production of the imported goods;
- (iii)  materials  consumed in the production of the imported goods;
- (iv)  engineering, development, artwork, elsewhere than
- design work, and plans and sketches undertaken in Tanzania and

<!-- image -->

necessary for the production of the imported goods;

- (e) royalties and licence fees related to the goods being valued that the buyer must pay, either  directly  or  indirectly,  as a condition of sale of the goods being valued, to the extent that such royalties  and  fees  are  not included  in  the  price  actually paid or payable;
- (d) the  value  of  any  part  of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the imported goods that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller.

(2)  In  determining  the  value for  duty  purposes of  any imported goods in accordance with paragraphs  2  to  7,  there  shall  be added to the price actually paid or payable for the goods:

<!-- image -->

- (a) the  cost  of  transport  of the imported goods to the port or place of importation into Tanzania;  provided  that in  the  case  of  air  freight only  25%  of  the  freight actually  paid  or  payable shall be added;
- (b) loading, unloading and handling charges associated with the

transport of the imported goods to the port or place of importation into Tanzania; and the cost of insurance.

- (3) Additions to the price actually  paid  or  payable  shall  be made under this paragraph only on the basis of objective and quantifiable data.
- (4) No additions shall be made to the price  actually  paid  or payable in determining the customs value  except  as  provided  in  this paragraph.
- 1.  Paragraphs  2  through  7  define  how the customs value of imported goods is to be determined under the provisions of this Schedule. The methods of valuation are set out in a sequential order of application. The primary  method  for  customs  valuation  is defined in paragraph 2 and imported goods are  to  be  valued  in  accordance  with  the provisions  of  this  paragraph  whenever  the conditions prescribed therein are fulfilled.
- 2. Where the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of paragraph  2, it is to be determined  by proceeding sequentially through the

<!-- image -->

Cap.4 s.8

succeeding paragraphs to the first such paragraph  under  which  the  customs  value can  be  determined.  Except  as  provided  in paragraph  5,  it  is  only  when  the  customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of a particular paragraph that the provisions of the next paragraph  in the sequence can be used.

- 3. Where the importer does not request that  the  order  of  paragraphs  6  and  7  be reversed,  the  normal  order  of  the  sequence is to be followed, and if the importer does so request  but  it then  proves  impossible  to determine the customs value under the provisions of paragraph 7, the customs value shall be determined under the provisions  of  paragraph  6,  if  it  can  be  so determined.

4. Where the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of paragraphs 2 through 7 it is to be determined under the provisions of paragraph 8.

## Use of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

- 1. 'Generally accepted accounting principles' refers to the recognised consensus or substantial authoritative support  within  Tanzania  at  a particular time as to which economic resources and obligations should be recorded as  assets  and  liabilities,  which changes in assets and liabilities should  be  recorded,  how  the assets and liabilities and

changes in them should be measured, what information should be disclosed and how it should be disclosed, and which financial  statements  should  be prepared. These standards may be broad guidelines of general application  as  well  as  detailed practices and procedures.

2.  For  the  purposes  of  this  Schedule, the  proper  officer  shall  utilise  information prepared in a manner consistent with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in Tanzania which is appropriate for the paragraph  in  question.  For example,  the determination  of  usual  profit  and  general expenses under the provisions of paragraph 6 would be carried out utilising information prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of Tanzania. On the other hand, the determination  of  usual  profit  and  general expenses under the provisions of paragraph 7 would be carried out utilising information prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the country  of production.  As  a  further example,  the  determination  of  an  element provided  for  in  subparagraph  (1)(b)(ii)  of paragraph  9  undertaken  in  Tanzania  would be  carried  out  utilising  information  in  a manner consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles of Tanzania.

## Note to paragraph 1

## Subparagraph (3)(e)

For the purposes of this Schedule, one person  shall  be  deemed  to  control  another when the former is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the latter.

## Subparagraph (4)

For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  1,  the term 'persons' includes a legal person, where appropriate.

## Note to paragraph 2

## Price Actually Paid or Payable

1. The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to or for  the  benefit  of  the  seller  for the  imported goods. The payment need not necessarily  take  the  form  of  a  transfer  of money.  Payment  may  be  made  by  way  of letters  of  credit  or  negotiable  instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly. An  example  of  an  indirect  payment  would be  the  settlement  by  the  buyer,  whether  in whole  or  in  part,  of  a  debt  owed  by  the seller.

- 2.  Activities  undertaken  by  the  buyer on  the  buyer''s  own  account,  other  than those for which an adjustment is provided in paragraph  8,  are  not  considered  to  be  an indirect  payment  to  the  seller,  even  though they might be regarded as of benefit to the seller. The costs of such activities shall not, therefore, be added to the price actually paid

or payable in determining the customs value.

- 3. The customs value shall not include the following charges or costs, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually  paid  or  payable  for  the  imported goods:
- (a) charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance, undertaken after importation on imported goods such as industrial plant, machinery or equipment;
- (b) the cost of transport after importation;
- (c) duties and taxes of Tanzania.

4.  The  price  actually  paid  or  payable refers  to  the  price  for  the  imported  goods. Thus the flow of dividends or other payments  from  the  buyer  to  the  seller  that do not relate to the imported goods are not part of the customs value.

Subparagraph (1)(a)(iii)

Among  restriction  which  would  not render a price actually paid or payable unacceptable  are  restrictions  which  do  not substantially  affect  the  value  of  the  goods. An  example  of  such  restrictions  would  be the  case  where  a  seller  requires  a  buyer  of automobiles not to sell or exhibit them.

## Subparagraph (1)(b)

- 1. Where the sale or price is subject to some condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued, the transaction

value  shall  not  be  acceptable  for  customs purposes. Some examples of this include:

- (a) the  seller  establishes  the  price  of the  imported  goods  on  condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in specified quantities;
- (b) the price of the imported goods is dependent upon the price or prices at which the buyer of the imported goods  sells other goods  to  the seller of the imported goods:
- (c) the price is established on  the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the imported goods, such as where the imported goods are semi-finished goods which have  been  provided  by  the  seller on  condition  that  the  seller  will receive a specified quantity of the finished goods.

2. However, conditions or considerations  relating  to  the  production  or marketing  of  the  imported  goods  shall  not result  in  rejection  of  the  transaction  value. For example, the fact that the buyer furnishes  the  seller  with  engineering  and plans undertaken in Tanzania shall not result in  rejection  of  the  transaction  value  for  the purposes  of  paragraph  2.  Likewise,  if  the buyer undertakes on the buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the seller, activities relating to the marketing of the imported goods, the value of these activities  is  not  part  of  the  customs  value nor shall such activities result in rejection of the transaction value.

## Subparagraph (2) and(3)

- 1.  Subparagraphs  (2)  and  (3)  provide different means of establishing the acceptability of a transaction value.
- 2. Subparagraph 2 provides that where the  buyer  and  the  seller  are  related,  the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the customs value provided that the relationship did not influence the price. It  is  not  intended  that  there  should  be  an examination of the circumstances in all cases  where  the  buyer  and  the  seller  are related. Such examination will only be required  where  there  are  doubts  about  the acceptability of the price. Where the proper officer has no doubts about the acceptability of  the  price,  it  should  be  accepted  without requesting further information from the owner. For example, the proper officer may have  previously  examined  the  relationship, or it may already have detailed information concerning  the  buyer  and  the  seller,  and may already be satisfied from such examination or information that the relationship did not influence the price.
- 3. Where the proper officer is unable to accept the transaction value without further inquiry, it should give the owner an opportunity  to  supply  such  further  detailed information as may be necessary to enable it to  examine  the  circumstances  surrounding the  sale.  In  this  context,  the  proper  officer should be prepared to examine  relevant aspects of the transaction, including the way in which the buyer and seller organise their commercial relations and the way in which

the price in question was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship influenced the price. Where it can be shown that  the  buyer  and  seller,  although  related under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  1,  buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related, this would demonstrate that the price had not been influenced by the relationship.  As  an  example  of  this,  if  the price had been settled in a manner consistent with  the  normal  pricing  practices  of  the industry  in  question  or  with  the  way  the seller  settles  prices  for  sales  to  buyers  who are  not  related  to  the  seller, this would demonstrate  that  the  price  had  not  been influenced by the relationship. As a further example, where it is shown that the price is adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit which is representative of the firm's overall  profit  realised  over  a  representative period  of  time  (e.g.  on  an  annual  basis)  in sales of goods of the same class or kind, this would  demonstrate  that  the  price  had  not been influenced.

4. Subparagraph (3) provides an opportunity for the importer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates  to  a  'test'  value  previously accepted by the proper officer and is therefore acceptable under the provisions of paragraph (2). Where a test under subparagraph (3) is met, it is not necessary to  examine the question  of  influence  under paragraph 2. If the proper officer has already sufficient information to be satisfied,  without  further  detailed  inquiries, that one of the tests provided in subparagraph (3) has been met, there  is  no reason  for  it to require the importer  to

Cap.4 s.8

demonstrate  that  the  test  can  be  met.  In subparagraph (3) the term 'unrelated buyers' means buyers who are not related to the seller in any particular case.

## Subparagraph (3)

A number of factors must be taken into consideration  in  determining  whether  one value 'closely approximates' to another value.  These  factors  include  the  nature  of the imported goods, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which  the goods are imported, and, whether the difference in values is commercially significant.  Since  these  factors  may  vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply  a  uniform  standard  such  as  a  fixed percentage,  in  each  case.  For  example,  a small difference in value in a case involving one  type  of  goods  could  be  unacceptable while a large difference in a case involving another  type  of  goods  might  be  acceptable in determining whether the transaction value closely approximates to the 'test' values set forth in subparagraph (3).

## Note to paragraph 3

- 1.  In  applying paragraph 3, the proper officer  shall,  wherever  possible,  use  a  sale of  identical  goods  at  the  same  commercial level and in substantially the same quantities as  the  goods  being  valued.  Where  no  such sale is  found, a sale of identical goods that takes place under any one of the following three conditions may be used:
- (a) a sale at the same commercial level but in different quantities;

- (b) a  sale  at  a  different  commercial level but in substantially the same quantities; or
- (c) a  sale  at  a  different  commercial level and in different quantities.
- 2.  Having  found  a  sale  under  any one of  these  three  conditions  adjustments  will then be made as the case may be, for:
- (a) quantity factors only;
- (b) commercial level factors only; or
- (c) both commercial level and quantity factors.
- 3.  The  expression  'and/or'  allows  the flexibility  to  use  the  sales  and  make  the necessary  adjustments  in  any  one  of  the three conditions described above.
- 4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the transaction value of identical imported goods  means  a  customs  value,  adjusted  as provided  in  subparagraphs  (1)(b)  and  (2), which  has already been accepted under paragraph 2.
- 5.  A  condition  for  adjustment  because of  different  commercial  levels  or  different quantities is that such adjustment, whether it leads  to  an  increase  or  a  decrease  in  the value, be made only on the basis of demonstrated evidence that clearly establishes the reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustments,  e.g.  valid  price  lists containing prices referring to different levels or  different  quantities.  As  an  example  of this, if the  imported  goods  being  valued consist  of  a  shipment  of  10  units  and  the only  identical  imported  goods  for  which  a transaction  value  exists  involved  a  sale  of

500 units, and it is recognised that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's  price  list  and  using that  price  applicable  to  a  sale  of  10  units. This does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however,  the  determination  of  a  customs value under the provisions of paragraph 3 is not appropriate.

## Note to paragraph 4

1.  In  applying paragraph 4, the proper officer  shall,  wherever  possible,  use  a  sale of  similar  goods  at  the  same  commercial level and in substantially the same quantities as  the  goods  being  valued.  Where  no  such sale  is  found,  a  sale  of  similar  goods  that takes place under any one of the following three conditions may be used:

- (a) a sale at the same  commercial level but in different quantities;
- (b) a  sale  at  a  different  commercial level but in substantially the same quantities; or
- (c) a  sale  at  a  different  commercial level and in different quantities.
- 2.  Having  found  a  sale  under  any one of  these  three  conditions  adjustments  will then be made, as the case may be, for:
- (a) quantity factors only;
- (b) commercial level factors only; or
- (c) both commercial level and quantity factors.

3.  The  expression  'and/or'  allows  the flexibility  to  use  the  soles  and  make  the necessary  adjustments  in  any  one  of  the three conditions described above.

For  the  purpose  of  paragraph  4,  the transaction value of similar imported goods means a customs value, adjusted as provided for in subparagraphs (1) (b) and (2), which has  already  been  accepted  under  paragraph 2.

A condition for adjustment because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment, whether it leads  to  an  increase  or  a  decrease  in  the value, be made only on the basis of demonstrated evidence that clearly establishes the reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustment, e.g. valid price lists containing prices referring to different levels or  different  quantities.  As  an  example  of this, if the  imported  goods  being  valued consist  of  a  shipment  of  10  units  and  the only  similar  imported  goods  for  which  a transaction  value  exists  involved  a  sale  of 500 units, and it is recognised that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's  price  list  and  using that  price  applicable  to  a  sale  of  10  units. This does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however,  the  determination  of  a  customs value under the provisions of paragraph 4 is not appropriate.

## Note to paragraph 6

- 1. The term 'unit price at which goods are  sold  in  the  greatest  aggregate  quantity' means the price at which the greatest number of units is  sold  in  sales  to  persons who  are  not  related  to  the  persons  from whom  they  buy  such  goods  at  the  first commercial level after importation at which such sales take place.
- 2.  As  an  example  of  this,  goods  are sold from a price list which grants favourable unit prices for purchases made in larger quantities.

units units

units

<!-- image -->

The greatest number of units sold at a price is 80; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 90.

- 3. As  another  example  of  this,  two sales  occur.  In  the  first  sale  500  units  are sold at a price of 95 currency units each. In the second sale 400 units are sold at a price of  90  currency units  each.  In  this  example, the greatest number  of units sold at a particular  price  is  500;  therefore,  the  unit price  in  the  greatest  aggregate  quantity  is 95.
- 4. A third example would be the following situation where various quantities

208

are sold at various prices.

- (a) Sales
- (b) Totals

| Sale quantity   |   Unit price |
|-----------------|--------------|
| 40 units        |          100 |
| 30 units        |           90 |
| 15 units        |          100 |
| 50 units        |           95 |
| 25 units        |          105 |
| 35 units        |          100 |
| 5 units         |           90 |

|   Total quantity sold |   Unit | price   |
|-----------------------|--------|---------|
|                    65 |    100 |         |
|                    50 |     90 |         |
|                    60 |    100 |         |
|                    25 |     95 |         |

In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 65; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 90.

- 5. Any sale in the importing country, as described  in  subparagraph  1  above,  to  a person  who  supplies  directly  or  indirectly free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale for export  of  the  imported  goods  any  of  the elements specified in subparagraph 1 (b) of paragraph 9, should not be taken into account in establishing the unit price for the purposes of paragraph 6.
- 209 6.  It  should  be  noted  that  'profit  and general expenses' referred to in subparagraph  (1)  of  paragraph  6  should  be taken as a whole. The figure for the

purposes of this deduction should be determined on the basis of information supplied  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  importer unless the importer's figures are inconsistent with those obtained in sales in Tanzania of imported  goods  of  the  same  class  or  kind. Where the importer's figures are inconsistent  with  such  figures,  the  amount for profit and  general  expenses  may  be based upon relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the owner.

- 7.  The  'general  expenses'  include  the direct  and  indirect  costs  of  marketing  the goods in question.
- 8. Local taxes payable by reason of the sale  of  the  goods  for  which  a  deduction  is not made under the provisions of subparagraph (1)(a)(iv) of paragraph 6 shall be deducted under the provisions of subparagraph (1)(a)(i) of paragraph 6.
- 9. In determining either the commissions or the usual profits and general expenses under the provisions of subparagraph (1) of paragraph 6, the question  whether  certain  goods  are  'of  the same class or kind' as other goods must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the circumstances involved. Sales in Tanzania of the narrowest group or range  of  imported  goods  of  the  same  class or  kind,  which  includes  the  goods  being valued, for which the necessary information can  be  provided,  should  be  examined.  For the  purposes  of  paragraph  6,  'goods  of  the same class or kind' includes goods imported from  the  same  country  as  the  goods  being valued as well as goods imported from other countries.

- 10. For the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b) of  paragraph  6,  the  'earliest  date'  shall  be the  date  by  which  sales  of  the  imported goods  or  of  identical  or  similar  imported goods  are  made  in  sufficient  quantity  to establish the unit price.
- 11. Where the method in subparagraph (2) of paragraph 6 is used, deductions made for  the  value  added  by  further  processing shall be based on objective and quantifiable data relating to the cost of such  work. Accepted industry formulas, recipes, methods of construction, and other industry practices would form the basis of the calculations.
- 12. It is recognised that the method of valuation provided for in subparagraph 2 of paragraph 6 would normally not be applicable  when,  as  a  result  of  the  further processing,  the  imported  goods  lose  their identity.  However,  there  can  be  instances where, although the identity of the imported goods is lost, the value added by the processing can be determined  accurately without unreasonable difficulty. On the other hand, there can also be instances where  the  imported  goods  maintain  their identity  but  form  such  a  minor  element  in the  goods  sold  in  Tanzania  that  the  use  of this valuation method would be unjustified. In view of the above, each situation of this type  must  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case basis.

## Note to paragraph 7

- 1.  As  a  general  rule,  customs  value  is determined  under  this  Agreement  on  the basis of information  readily  available  in

Tanzania. In order to determine a computed value, however,  it may  be  necessary  to examine  the  costs  of  producing  the  goods being  valued  and  other  information  which has  to  be  obtained  from  outside  Tanzania. Furthermore, in most cases the producer of the goods will be outside the jurisdiction of the  authorities  of  Tanzania.  The  use  of  the computed  value  method  will  generally  be limited  to  those  cases  where  the  buyer  and seller are related and the producer is prepared  to supply  to the authorities of Tanzania the necessary costings and to provide facilities for any subsequent verification which may be necessary.

<!-- image -->

- 2. The  'cost  or  value'  referred  to  in subparagraph (1) (a) of paragraph 7 is to be determined on the basis of information relating to the production  of  the  goods  being valued supplied by or on behalf of the producer. It is to be based upon the commercial accounts of the producer, provided that such accounts are consistent  with  the  generally accepted  accounting  principles applied  in  the  country  where the goods are produced.
- 3. The 'cost or value' shall include the cost of elements specified in subparagraphs (1)(a)(ii)  and  (iii)  of  paragraph  9.  It  shall also include the value, apportioned as appropriate under the provisions of the relevant note to paragraph 9, of any element specified in subparagraph (1)(b) of paragraph 9 which has been supplied

directly or indirectly by the buyer for use in connection with the production of the imported goods. The value of the elements specified in subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) of paragraph 9 which are undertaken in Tanzania shall be included only to the extent that such elements are charged to the producer. It is to be understood that no cost or  value  of  the  elements  referred  to  in  this paragraph shall be counted twice in determining the computed value.

- 4.  The  'amount  for  profit  and  general expenses' referred to in subparagraph (1)(b) of  paragraph  7  is  to  be  determined  on  the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer unless the producer's figures  are  inconsistent  with  those  usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to Tanzania.

5. It should be noted in this context that the 'amount for profit and general expenses'  has  to  be  taken  as  a  whole.  It follows  that  if,  in  any  particular  case,  the producer's profit figure is low and the producer's  general  expenses  are  high,  the producer's profit and general expenses taken together may nevertheless be consistent with that usually reflected in sales of goods of the same  class  or  kind.  Such  a  situation  might occur, for example, if a product were being launched in Tanzania and the producer accepted  a  nil  or  low  profit  to  offset  high general expenses associated with the launch. Where the producer can demonstrate a low profit on sales of the imported goods because of particular commercial

circumstances,  the  producer's  actual  profit figures should be taken into account provided that the producer has valid commercial reasons to justify them and the producer's pricing policy reflects usual pricing  policies  in  the  branch  of  industry concerned. Such a situation might occur, for example, where producers have been forced to  lower  prices  temporarily  because  of  an unforeseeable  drop  in  demand,  or  where they  sell  goods  to  complement  a  range  of goods being produced in Tanzania and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. Where the producer's own figures  for  profit  and  general  expenses  are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers  in  the  country  of  exportation  for export  to  Tanzania,  the  amount  for  profit and  general  expenses  may  be  based  upon relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the goods.

- 6.  Where  information  other  than  that supplied by or on behalf of the producer is used for the purposes of determining  a computed  value,  the  proper  officer  shall inform the importer, if the latter so requests, of  the  source  of  such  information,  the  data used  and  the  calculations  based  upon  such data,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  section 108.
- 7.  The  'general  expenses'  referred  to in subparagraph (1)(b) of paragraph 7 covers the direct and indirect costs of producing  and  selling  the  goods  for  export which are not included under subparagraph (1) (a) of paragraph 7.

- 8.  Whether  certain  goods  are  'of  the same class or kind' as other goods must be determined  on  a  case-by-case  basis  with reference to  the  circumstances  involved.  In determining  the  usual  profits  and  general expenses under the provisions of paragraph 7, sales for export to Tanzania of the narrowest  group  or  range  of  goods,  which includes the goods being valued, for which the  necessary  information  can  be  provided, should  be  examined.  For  the  purposes  of paragraph  7,  'goods  of  the  same  class  or kind' must be from the same country as the goods being valued.

## Note to paragraph 8

1.  Customs  values  determined  under the provisions of paragraph 8 should, to the greatest extent possible, be based on previously determined customs values.

2. The  methods  of  valuation  to  be employed  under paragraph 8 should be those  laid  down  in  paragraph  1  through  6 but a reasonable flexibility in the application of  such  methods  would  be  in  conformity with the aims and provisions of paragraph 8. Some examples of reasonable flexibility are as follows:

- (a) Identical goods -the requirement  that  the  identical goods should be exported at or about the same  time as the goods  being  valued  could  be flexibly interpreted; identical imported  goods  produced  in  a country  other  than  the  country of exportation of the goods

G.N. No. 122 of 1967

being valued could be the basis for  customs  valuation;  customs values of identical imported goods already determined under the  provisions  of  paragraphs  6 and 7 could be used.

- (b) Similar goods -the requirement that the similar goods should be exported at or about the same  time as the goods  being  valued  could  be flexibly interpreted; similar imported  goods  produced  in  a country  other  than  the  country of exportation of the goods being valued could be the basis for  customs  valuation;  customs values of similar imported goods already determined under the  provisions  of  paragraphs  6 and 7 could be used.

(c) Deductive methods -the requirement that the goods shall have been sold in the 'condition as imported' in subparagraph (1)(a) of paragraph  6  could  be  flexibly interpreted; the '90 days' requirement could be administered flexibly.

Note to paragraph 9 Subparagraph (1)(a)(i)

The term 'buying commissions' means fees paid by importer to the importer's agent for the service of representing the importer abroad  in  the  purchase  of  the  goods  being valued.

## Subparagraph (1)(b)(ii)

- 1. There are two factors involved in the apportionment  of  the  elements  specified  in subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of paragraph 9 to the imported  goods  -  the  value  of  the  element itself  and the way in which that value is to be  apportioned  to  the  imported  goods.  The apportionment  of  these  elements  should  be made in a reasonable manner appropriate to the  circumstances  and  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles.
- 2. Concerning the value of the element, if  the  importer acquires the element from a seller not related to the importer at a given cost, the value of the element is that cost. If the  element  was  produced by the owner or by a person related to the importer, its value would  be  the  cost  of  producing  it.  If  the element  had  been  previously  used  by  the owner,  regardless  of  whether  it  had  been acquired  or  produced  by  such  owner,  the original  cost  of  acquisition  or  production would  have  to  be  adjusted  downward  to reflect its use in order to arrive at the value of the element.
- 3.  Once  a  value  has  been  determined for the element, it is necessary to apportion that  value  to  the  imported  goods.  Various possibilities  exist.  For  example,  the  value might be apportioned to the first shipment if the importer wishes to pay duty on the entire value at one time. As another example, the importer may  request  that the value be apportioned over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment. As a further example, the importer may  request  that the value be

apportioned over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. The method of apportionment used will depend upon  the  documentation  provided  by  the importer.

- 4.  As  an  illustration  of  the  above,  an importer provides the producer with a mould  to  be  used  in  the  production  of  the imported goods and contracts with the producer to buy 10,000 units. By the time of arrival  of  the  first  shipment  of  1,000  units, the  producer  has  already  produced  4,000 units.  The  importer  may  request  the  proper officer  to  apportion  the  value  of  the  mould over  1,000  units, 4,000  units or 10,000 units.

## Subparagraph 1(b)(iv)

- 1. Additions for the elements specified in  subparagraph  (1)(b)(iv)  of  paragraph  9 should be based on objective an quantifiable data.  In  order  to  minimise  the  burden  for both the importer and  proper  officer in determining  the  values  to  be  added,  data readily available in the buyer's commercial record  system  should  be  used  in  so  far  as possible.
- 2.  For  those  elements  supplied  by  the buyer  which  were  purchased  or  leased  by the buyer, the addition would be the cost of the purchase or the lease. No addition shall be made for those elements available in the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.
- 3. The  ease  with  which  it  may  be possible to calculate the values to be added

will  depend on a particular firm's structure and  management  practice,  as  well  as  its accounting methods.

- 4. It is possible for example, that a firm which  imports  a  variety  of  products  from several countries maintains the records of its design  centre  outside  Tanzania  in  such  a way as to show accurately the costs attributable to a given  product. In such cases, a direct adjustment may appropriately be  made under the provisions of paragraph 9.
- 5. In another case, a firm may carry the cost of the design centre outside Tanzania as a general overhead expense without allocation to specific products. In this instance, an appropriate adjustment could be made  under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  9 with respect to the imported goods by apportioning  total  design  centre  costs  over total  production  benefiting  from  the  design centre and adding such apportioned cost on a unit basis to imports.
- 6. Variations in the above circumstances will, of course, require different factors to be considered in determining the proper method of allocation.
- 7. In cases where the production of the element  in  question  involves  a  number  of countries  and  over  a  period  of  time,  the adjustment  should  be  limited  to  the  value actually added to that element outside Tanzania.

## Subparagraph (1)(c)

- 1. The royalties and licence fees referred to in subparagraph (1)© of paragraph 9 may include, among  other things, payments in respect to patents, trademarks  and  copyrights.  However,  the charges for the right to reproduce the imported  goods  in  Tanzania  shall  not  be added to the price actually paid or  payable for  the  imported  goods  in  determining  the customs value.
- 2. Payments made by the buyer for the right  to  distribute  or  resell  the  imported goods shall not be added to the price actually  paid  or  payable  for  the  imported goods if such payments are not a condition of  the  sale  for  export  to  Tanzania  of  the imported goods.

## Subparagraph (3)

Where objective  and  quantifiable  data do  not  exist  with  regard  to  the  additions required to be made under the provisions of paragraph 9, the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of paragraph  2.  As  an  illustration  of  this,  a royalty is paid on the basis of the price in a sale in the importing country of a litre of a particular product that was imported by the kilogram and made up into a solution after importation. If the royalty is based partially on the imported goods and partially on other factors  which  have  nothing  to  do  with  the imported goods (such as when the imported goods are  mixed  with  domestic  ingredients and are no longer separately identifiable, or when  the  royalty  cannot  be  distinguished

GN. Nos. 122 of 1967 122 of 1977 Acts. Nos. 9 of 1977 s.4 9 of 1988 s.9 18 of 2002 is14 and 15 11 of 2000

s.8

from special financial arrangements between the buyer and the seller), it would he inappropriate to attempt to make  an addition  for  the  royalty.  However.  if  the amount of this royalty is based only on the imported goods and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made.
