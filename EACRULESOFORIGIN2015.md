## RULE 6

## Goods produced using materials not wholly obtained from a Partner State

- 1. For the purposes of rule 4(b), a product is considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the product listed in the second column of Part 1 of the First Schedule fulfils the corresponding origin criteria in the third column.

- 2. The determination of whether the requirements of Part 1 of the First Schedule are met shall be carried out for each product.
- 3. Where a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the origin criteria set out in Part 1 of  the First Schedule is used in the manufacture of another product, the origin criteria applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non- originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.
- 4. Where the origin criteria in Part 1 of the First Schedule applicable to the product is based on compliance with a maximum content of non-originating materials, in order to take into account fluctuations in costs and currency rates, the value of the non-originating materials and ex-works price may be calculated on an average basis as set out in paragraph 5.
- 5. An average ex-works price of the product and average value of non-originating materials used shall be  calculated respectively on the basis of:
- (a) the sum of the ex-works prices charged for all sales of the products carried out during the preceding fiscal year; and

- 8. A manufacturer or an exporter may cease to apply the method in paragraph 5 where during a given fiscal year, or a shorter period of not less than three months, if the manufacturer or exporter records that the fluctuations in costs or currency rates which justified the use of such a method have ceased.

## RULE 8

## Cumulation of origin

- 1. Materials  which  originate  in  a  Partner  State  and  which  undergo  working  or processing  in  another  Partner  State,  shall  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the origin of a finished product be deemed to have originated in the Partner State where the final working or processing takes place.
- 2. Materials  which  originate  in  a  country  or  a  Regional  Economic  Community that  the  Community  has  concluded  a  Free  Trade Area Agreement with,  shall be  considered  as  materials  originating  in  a  Partner  State  if  the  materials  are incorporated into goods produced in that Partner State, where the working or processing carried out in that Partner State goes beyond the operations referred to in rule 7.
- 3. Materials which originate from a country or a territory benefiting from duty free, quota free access to the market of the country or Regional Economic Community that  the  Community  has  concluded  a  Free  Trade Area Agreement with,  shall be  considered  as  materials  originating  in  a  Partner  State  if  the  materials  are incorporated into goods produced in that Partner State, where the working or processing carried out in that Partner State goes beyond the operations referred to in rule 7.

- 4. The Cumulation provided in paragraph 3 shall not apply to materials in Schedule 2 of the East African Community Common External Tariff.
- 5. Without prejudice to rule 4, non-originating materials which at importation into a Partner State from a foreign country are free of customs duties under the East African Community Common External Tariff, shall be considered as materials originating in the Partner State when incorporated into goods produced in that Partner State, where the materials have undergone sufficient working or processing beyond that referred to in rule 7.
- 6. This rule shall not apply to materials which, at importation to a Partner State, are subject to the East African Community Customs Union (Antidumping Measures) Regulations  or  the  East  African  Community  Customs  Union  (Subsidies  and Countervailing Measures) Regulations.

## RULE 9 Unit of qualification

- 1. In classifying goods under this rule, each item in a consignment shall be considered separately.
- 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1:
- (a) where  the  Harmonized  Commodity  Description  and  Coding  System specifies that a  group, set or assembly of articles is to be classified within a single heading, such a  group , set or assembly shall be treated as one article; and
- (b) tools, parts and accessories imported with an article, and whose prices are included in the price of the article or for which no separate charge is made, shall be considered as forming a whole with the article which the tools, parts and accessories constitute the standard equipment customarily included in the sale of articles of that kind.
- 3. In  cases  not  within  paragraph  2,  goods  shall  be  treated  as  a  single  article  for purposes of assessing customs duties on like articles by the importing Partner State.
- 4. An unassembled or disassembled article, which is imported in more than one consignment because it is not feasible  for transportation or production reasons to import it in a single consignment, shall be treated as one article.

## Sets

- 1. A set defined in General Interpretative Rule 3 of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System shall be regarded as originating in a Partner State where all the component products originate from the Partner State.
- 2. Where a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating in a Partner State if the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.

## RULE 11

## Separation of materials

Where it is not practicable for the producer to physically separate materials of similar character but different origin used in the production of goods, the producer shall use Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles  adopted  by  the  Partner  State  where  the product is produced to ensure that no more goods are deemed to originate in the Partner State than would have been the case if the materials were physically separated.

## RULE12

## Treatment of mixtures

- 1. In the case of the mixtures, which are not groups, sets or assemblies of goods under rule 9, a Partner State  may refuse to accept  as originating in another Partner State, any product resulting from the mixing  together of  goods which would qualify as originating in the Partner State with goods which  would not qualify as originating  in the Partner State, where the characteristics  of the product as a whole are not different from the characteristics of the goods which have been mixed.
- 2. In the case of particular products where it is recognized by the Council that it desirable  to  permit  mixing  together  of  goods  described  in  paragraph  1,  such products shall be accepted as originating in the Partner States in respect of that part  of  the  product  as  may  be  shown  to  correspond  to  the  quantity  of  goods originating in the Partner State used in the mixing, subject to such conditions as may be agreed upon by the Council.

## RULE13

## Treatment of packing

- 1. For the purposes of assessing customs duties, a Partner State may treat goods separately from their packing and may in respect of its imports consigned from another Partner State, determine the origin of the packing, separately.
- 2. Where paragraph 1 is not applicable, the packing shall be considered as forming a whole with the goods and no part of any packing required for the transport or storage shall be considered as having been imported from outside the Partner State in determining the origin of the goods as a whole.
- 3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, packing with which goods are ordinarily sold at retail shall not be regarded as packing required for the transport or storage of the goods.
- 4. Where the packing materials and containers in which goods are packaged for retail sale shall be classified with the goods in accordance with General Interpretative Rule  5  of  the  Harmonized  Commodity  Description  and  Coding  System,  the packing materials and containers shall be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the goods where the goods undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in Part 1 of the First Schedule.
- 5. Where the goods in Paragraph 4, are subject to a value-added  requirement, the value  of  the  packing  materials  and  containers  shall  be  taken  into  account  as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the value added to the goods.
- 6. The containers which are used only for transportation or temporary storage of goods and are to be returned shall not be subjected to customs duties and other charges of equivalent effect.
- 7. The containers used for transportation or temporary storage of goods, which are not returned, shall be treated separately from the goods contained in them and shall be subject to import duties and other charges of equivalent effect.

## RULE 14

## Neutral elements

- (a) energy and fuel;
- (b) plant and equipment;
- (c) machines and tools; and
- (d) goods  which  do  not  enter  and  are  not  intended  to  enter  into  the  final composition of the product.

## RULE 15

## Territoriality

- 1. Except as provided for in rule 8, a product shall qualify as originating in a Partner State where the product fulfils the requirements of rule 4 to rule 14.

## PART 2

## Explanatory notes to the list in Part 1

## Note 1: Introduction

- 1.1 The list sets out the origin criteria required for all products to be considered as having undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of rule 6 of these Rules. The following criteria shall apply, as appropriate and as indicated in Part 1 in respect of each chapter, heading or sub-heading given in column 1:
- (i) working or processing of certain wholly produced materials;
- (ii) working or processing where the value of all the non-originating materials used in manufacture does not exceed a certain maximum threshold;
- (iii) working or processing where the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit  Harmonized  System    sub-heading  of  the  manufactured  products becomes different from the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading respectively of the materials used.;
- (iv) a specific working or processing operation is carried out.
- 1.2 The  above  origin  criteria  may  be  applied  independent  of  each  other  or  as alternatives as specified in Part 1.

## 1.3 Examples: Application of Note 1.1(ii)

- (a) Where  the  maximum  amount  of  non-originating  materials used in manufacture does not exceed 70% of the ex-works price of the finished product, it means that the minimum value added by a producer in a Partner State is 30% of the ex-works price of the given product.
- (b) Where for products of headings 87.11 to 87.12, the maximum amount of non-originating materials used in manufacture does not exceed 70% of the ex-works price of the finished product, it means that the minimum value added by a producer in a Partner State is 30% of the ex-works price of the given product

## Note 2: Structure of Part 1

- 2.1 The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number, sub-heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading, sub-heading or chapter. For each entry in the first

- two columns the rules are specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading or sub heading as described in column 2.
- 2.2 Where several heading or sub heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore  given  in  general  terms,  the  adjacent  rules  in  column  3  apply  to  all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.
- 2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3.
- 2.4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, more than one rule is specified in column 3, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either of the rules set out in column 3.

## Note 3: Examples of how the rules are applied

- 3.1 The provisions  of  rule  6  of  these  Rules  concerning  products  having  acquired originating  status  which  are  used  in  the  manufacture  of  other  products  apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Partner States.
- 3.2 Pursuant to rule 7, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in that rule. If it does not, the finished products shall not qualify for Community tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list in Part 1 are met.
- 3.3 The rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing required  and  the  carrying  out  of  more  working  or  processing  also  confers originating  status;  conversely,  the  carrying  out  of  less  working  or  processing cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.
- 3.4 Without prejudice to Note 3.3 where a rule uses the expression 'Manufacture from materials of any heading', then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as  the product) may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.

However, the expression 'Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …' or 'Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product' means that materials of  any  heading(s)    may  be  used,  except  those  of  the  same  description  as  the product as given in column 2 of the list.

- 3.5 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular  material,  the  condition  obviously  does  not  prevent  the  use  of  other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.

## Note 4: General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods

Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 24.01 which are harvested in the territory of a Partner State shall be treated as originating in the territory of that Partner State, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from a foreign country.

## Note 5: Terminology used for certain textile products

- 5.1 The term 'natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste,  and,  unless  otherwise  specified,  includes  fibres  that  have  been  carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.
- 5.2 The term 'natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading  05.03, silk of heading 50.02 and 50.03 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading 51.01 to 51.05, the cotton fibres of heading 52.01 to 52.03 and the other vegetable fibres of heading 53.01 to 53.05.
- 5.3 The term 'man-made staple fibres' is used in the list  to  refer  to  synthetic  or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading 55.01 to 55.07.

## Note 6: Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials

- 6.1 Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4 below).
- 6.2 However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials:

- (a) silk;
- (b) wool;
- (c) coarse animal hair;
- (d) fine animal hair;
- (e) horsehair;
- (f) cotton;
- (g) paper-making materials and paper;
- (h) flax;
- (i) true hemp;
- (j) jute and other textile bast fibres;
- (k) sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;
- (l) coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;
- (m) synthetic man-made filaments;
- (n) artificial man-made filaments;
- (o) current conducting filaments;
- (p) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;
- (q) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;
- (r) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;
- (s) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;
- (t) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;
- (u) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;
- (v) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide;
- (w) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride;
- (x) other synthetic man-made staple fibres;

- (y) artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;
- (z) other artificial man-made staple fibres;
- (aa) yarn  made  of  polyurethane  segmented  with  flexible  segments  of polyether whether or not gimped;
- (bb) products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether  or  not  coated  with  aluminium  powder,  of  a  width  not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;
- (cc) other products of heading 56.05;
- (dd) glass fibre;
- (ee) metal fibre.

## Example:

A yarn of heading 52.05 made from cotton fibres of heading 52.03 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 55.06 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.

## Example:

Tufted textile fabric of heading 58.02 made from cotton yarn of heading 52.05 and cotton fabric of heading 52.10 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.

## Example:

If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 52.05 and synthetic fabric of heading 54.07, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.

- 6.3 In  the  case  of  products  incorporating  'yarn  made  of  polyurethane  segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.

- 6.4 In the case of products incorporating 'strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film', this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.

## Note 7 : Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products

- 7.1 Where, in the list reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned, may be used, provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.
- 7.2 Materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 - 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.
- 7.3 If a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, fabric must  be  used,  this  does  not  prevent  the  use  of  metal  items,  such  as  buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.
- 7.4 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

## Note 8: Specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of Chapter 27

- 8.1 For the purposes of headings ex 27.07 and 27.13 the 'specific processes' are the following:
- (a) vacuum distillation;
- (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;
- (c) cracking;
- (d) reforming;
- (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;
- (f) the  process  comprising  all  the  following  operations:  processing  with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;

- (g) polymerization;
- (h) alkylation;
- (i) isomerization.
- 8.2 For the purposes of heading 27.10, 27.11 and 27.12, the 'specific processes' are the following:
- (a) vacuum distillation;
- (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;
- (c) cracking;
- (d) reforming;
- (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;
- (f) the  process  comprising  all  the  following  operations:  processing  with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolourization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;
- (g) polymerization;
- (h) alkylation;
- (i) isomerization;
- (j) in  respect  of  heavy  oils  falling  within  heading  ex  27.10  only,  desulphurization with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);
- (k) in respect of products falling within heading 27.10 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;
- (l) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading  ex 27.10 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250°C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading ex 27.10 (e.g. hydro finishing or decolorization) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;
- (m) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading ex 27.10 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300°C by the ASTM D 86 method;

- (n) in  respect  of  heavy  oils  other  than  gas  oils  and  fuel  oils  falling  within heading ex 27.10 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.
- 8.3 For  the  purposes  of  headings  ex  27.07  and  27.13,  simple  operations  such  as cleaning,  decanting,  desalting,  water  separation,  filtering,  colouring,  marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.

## 8.4       Mixing and blending

For  the  purposes  of  headings  27.07  and  27.10  to  27.15,  the  deliberate  and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials to conform to predetermined specifications which results in the production of a good having physical, chemical characteristics which are relevant to the purposes or uses of the good and are different from the input materials is to be considered origin conferring.

- 1. Msafirishaji lazima aingizwe kwenye fomu ya hati ya uasili  taarifa inayohitajika  katika kisanduku cha 1 hadi cha 10 fomu , isipokuwa kisanduku  cha 4,ambacho kimewekwa  kwa ajili  ya matumizi ya ofisi.
- 2. Fomu inaweza kutayarishwa kwa mchakato  wowote ili  mradi maelezo  yasifutike na yasomeke. Hairuhusiwi kufutafuta  au kuongeza chochote katika fomu, na marekebisho lazima yafanywe kwa kukata maelezo  yaliyokosewa na ndipo kuingiza nyongeza  zinazohitajika.marekebisho ya aina hiyo  lazima yawe na herufi za kwanza  za jina la mtu aliyejaza  fomu na kuidhinishwa na mamlaka  au chombo kilichoteuliwa kutoa hati.
- 3. Nafasi yoyote katika fomu ambayo haijatumika ikatwe kwa mstari kwa namna ambayo  itazuia kuongeza chochote.
- 4. Katika kisanduku cha 7 chenye  kichwa cha habari' kigezo cha uasili wa bidhaa' kigezo maalumu  kinachostahili chini ya kanuni ya 4 ya aya 1  ya jumuiya ya afrika masharaki ya uasili lazima kiingizwe. Kwa madhumuni  haya, herufi zifuatazo lazima zitumike dhidi ya kila kipengelee kilichoingizwa kwenye fomu, kwa jinsi inavyofaa yaani:-
- ' P' Kwa bidhaa ambazo kigezo  cha uasili  timilifu  wa uzalishaji wa bidhaa kimetumika
- 'M' Kwa bidhaa ambazo kigezo cha matumizi ya malighafi ya ndani kimetumika
- 'C' Kwa bidhaa zinazoainishwa kwa kigezo cha kubadilika kifungu cha utambulisho wa bidhaa katika tarakimu 4 au kifungu kidogo cha utambulisho wa bidha katika tarakimu 6 tofauti na utambulisho ule ilipoingilia kimetumika
- 'S' Kwa bidhaa ambazo kuna kiwango cha kazi mahususi au usindikaji umefanyika
- 5. Taarifa ya msafirishaji  ambayo inapaswa kutolewa katika  kisanduku cha 10  ijumuishwe katika nafasi iliyowekwa, papo hapo kufuatia  maneno '  iliyozalishwa katika'  nchi ambako  bidha zimezalishwa.
- 6. Kabla ya kutia saini  taarifa katika au kisanduku cha  11 ya fomu msafirishaji anapaswa kuhakikisha  kuwa maelezo yote aliyoingiza   kwenye fomu ni sahihi. Lazima  awe tayari  kutoa uthibitisho  zaidi, ambao unaweza  ukatakiwa na mamlaka ya uthibitisho  kwa madhumuni   ya kutoa hati, katika kisanduku  cha 11  cha fomu.
- 7. Wakati msafirishaji  ana uhuru wa kuamua  ni nani atie saini kwenye taarifa kwa niaba yake,  inafaa kwamba mtu aliyeidhinishwa kufanya hivyo awe ofisa wa kampuni ya msafirishaji.taarifa zinazotiwa saini na mawakala wa meli au wa usafirishaji au wengine  kama hawa  hazikubaliki.
- 8. Fomu ya hati ya uasili ijazwe katika nakala  tatu kwa ajili  ya kuwasilishwa kwenye mamlaka yanayothibitisha.
- 9. Muhuri wa mamlaka yanayoidhinisha  unapaswa kuwa na alama za kiusalama  ambazo zinatambuliwa na jumuiya ya afrika mashariki.
- 10.  Pamoja na matakwa ya sheria namba 19 na kwa kufuata utaratibu wa sheria namba 18 ni lazima mzigo uambatane na hati ya uasili wa bidhaa husika.
