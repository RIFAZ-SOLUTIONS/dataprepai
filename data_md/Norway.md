Where under this Convention income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the other Contracting State is exempt from tax in the first-mentioned State, then the first-mentioned State may, in calculating tax on the remaining income of that person, apply the rate of tax which would have been applicable if the income exempted from tax in accordance with the Convention had not been so exempted.
- 4. For the purpose of paragraph 2, the term "tax paid in Tanzania" shall be deemed to include any amount which would have been payable as Tanzanian tax for any year but for:
- (i) any investment deduction granted under paragraphs 24, 25 and 26 of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1973; or

The taxation of a permanent establishment or a fixed base which an enterprise or a person being a resident of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises or persons of that other State carrying on the same activities.

This provision shall not be construed as preventing a Contracting State from taxing profits derived by a permanent establishment according to the legislation of that State if the permanent establishment is maintained by a company being a resident of the other Contracting State. The taxation, however, shall not exceed that to which companies being residents of the first-mentioned State are liable with respect to their retained profits.

- 3. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of that firstmentioned State are or may be subjected.
- 4. The provisions of this Article shall not be construed as obliging Norway to grant to nationals of Tanzania, not being nationals of Norway, the exceptional tax relief which is accorded to Norwegian nationals and individuals born in Norway of parents having Norwegian nationality pursuant to Section 22 of the Norwegian Taxation Act for the Rural Districts and Section 17 of the Norwegian Taxation Act for the Urban Districts.

- 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the national laws of the Contracting States.
- 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.
- 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

## Protocol

At the signing of the Convention between the Kingdom of Norway and the United Republic of Tanzania for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and Capital the undersigned have agreed that the following shall form an integral part of the Convention:

The Contracting States agree that paragraph 2 of Article 24 shall be replaced by the following text, at the request of Norway, which shall be forwarded through diplomatic channels. The new text below shall thereupon become effective in a manner similar to that set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 30 of the Convention:

"When a resident of Norway derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Tanzania, Norway shall allow as a deduction from the income tax or capital tax of that person an amount equal to the income tax or capital tax paid in Tanzania. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Norwegian tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is appropriate to the income derived from or capital owned in Tanzania."
