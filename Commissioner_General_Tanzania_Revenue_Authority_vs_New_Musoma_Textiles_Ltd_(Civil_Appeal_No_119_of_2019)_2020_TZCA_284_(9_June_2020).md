## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

aggrieved, the appellant now challenges the aforesaid grant of extension of time.

The  background  to  the  present  dispute  as  succinctly  summarized  in the Tribunal's decision  is as follows:  in early 2001, the appellant demanded from  the  respondent, an  owner  of  a  textile manufacturing  factory  at Musoma,  Mara  Region,  payment of TZS.  411,160,694.00 as taxes of which TZS. 202,394,342.00 was assessed as excise duty and TZS. 208,766,552.00 being Value Added Tax ("VAT"). The respondent disputed both assessments except  TZS.  108,255,403.00  as  VAT  which  it  duly  paid.  Following  some discussions,  the  appellant  reviewed  the  outstanding  VAT  payable  down  to TZS. 47,471,373.00 but the respondent gave a counter assessment of TZS. 7,472,346.00. Then, the parties agreed to review the assessment thoroughly pending which the respondent would make monthly instalments to  the  appellant.  Depending  on  the  outcome  of the  review,  the  payments would subsequently be refunded or treated as tax deposits.

Despite  the  above  understanding,  the  appellant  issued  a  warrant  of distress  on  25t h   May,  2001  and  commissioned  his  agent,  Messrs.  Spider Auction  Mart and Court Brokers based in  Mwanza, to execute it. The agent executed the warrant on,  25t h June, 2001 by confiscating from the

respondent's  factory  and  moving  to  its  premises  goods  estimated  to  be worth TZS.  3,360,868,739.00. The respondent's effort to  have the warrant lifted  bore  no  fruit  until  20t h   September,  2004  when  the  parties  signed  a Memorandum  of  Understanding  to  the  effect  that  the  appellant  would release and restore the goods against the respondent depositing as security its Certificate of Title No. 033032/1 over its landed property in Mwanza.

The  respondent  claimed  that  pursuant  to  the  said  Memorandum  of Understanding, the appellant only returned goods, mostly damaged, estimated to be worth TZS. 63,148,507.00. Upon demand by the respondent, the appellant, it seems, accepted responsibility for compensation  in  principle  and  thus,  a  joint  probe  committee,  formed  to assess  and  determine  the  exact  extent of  liability,  set the  liability  at TZS. 2,738,397,579.00, down  from  the  claimed  TZS. 3,360,868,739.00.  The committee's  report  was  signed  in  December,  2005.  As  it  turned  out,  the appellant disputed the committee's findings and conclusions,  and only paid the respondent TZS. 49,724;024.00.

Being  dissatisfied  by  the  appellant's  recalcitrance,  on  1s t   December, 2006 the respondent instituted Civil  Case No.  22 of 2006 in the  High Court of Tanzania at Mwanza for payment of the money as set forth  by the joint

probe committee. On 27t h  March, 2007, the High Court (Sumari, J.) entered judgment in favour of the respondent for the sum of TZS. 2,738,297,579.00.  The matter did  not end there as the appellant contested the judgment by way of an appeal to the Court of Appeal (Civil Appeal  No. 93 of 2009). In a judgment delivered on 9t h  June, 2011, this Court held that since the proceeding before the High Court was of civil  nature in  respect of a dispute arising from a revenue law, to wit, the Value Added Tax Act, Cap. 148  RE  2002  and  since  the  law  is  one  of  those  administered  by  the appellant  and on  which  the Board had  sole  jurisdiction to determine disputes arising  therefrom,  the  High  Court  had  no jurisdiction  to  hear and determine the suit. Accordingly, the Court quashed the aberrant proceedings before the High Court and the resulting judgment as they were fruits of a nullity.

In its further  pursuit  for  justice,  the respondent  approached  the Board, vide VAT Application No. 8 of 2011  lodged on 28t h  September, 2011, seeking extension of time under section  16 (5) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act,  Cap.  408  R.E.  2009  ("the  TRAA")  to  lodge  a  notice  of  appeal  and institute an appeal against the appellant's refusal to pay compensation. The Board  dismissed  the  application  with  costs  mainly  on  the  ground  that  it failed to disclose any reasonable case; that the respondent's failure to lodge the suit in time was as much a  result of forum shopping  by disingenuously turning  a  tax  dispute  into  an  ordinary  suit  as  it  was  due  to  a  lack  of diligence.  As  hinted  earlier,  the  Tribunal,  on  appeal,  reversed  the  Board's decision  and  granted  the  respondent thirty  days  from  the  date  thereof to institute  the  intended  appeal  at the  Board.  Being  aggrieved,  the  appellant challenges the Tribunal's decision on four grounds as follows:

- "1.  The Honourable  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in its finding that the dispute between the parties ceased to be a tax dispute but one for recovery of  loss and damage;
- 2.  The Honourable  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law basing his (sic) decision by invoking the provisions of  section 21 (1)  of the  Law of Limitation Act [Cap.  89  R.E.  2002] as  the applicable provisions for extension of  time in tax  proceedings;
- 3.  The Honourable Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding  that litigating  in  wrong  fora  constitutes  a  reasonable cause for extension of time under the provisions of section  16 (5) of  the Tax Revenue Appeals  Act  [Cap. 408 R.E. 2009]; and
- 4. The  Honourable  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  erred  in issuing  a  blanket  exclusion  of  the  period  within which  the respondent  was  litigating  in  the  wrong  fora  and  in  granting extension  of time  to  the  respondent  without considering  the period  under  which  the  respondent  was  not litigating  in  any forum."

At the hearing of the appeal before us, Messrs. Sylvanus Mayenga and Thompson  M.  Luhanga,  learned  advocates,  joined  forces  to  represent the appellant whereas Mr. Joseph K. Sungwa, learned counsel, appeared for the respondent.

Mr.  Mayenga began his oral argument by adopting the contents of the written  submissions  he  had  filed  in  support  of the  appeal.  In  highlighting the  submissions,  Mr.  Mayenga  started  with  the  fourth  ground  of  appeal positing that the respondent failed to account for a delay of 117 days from 1s t   June,  2011  when  this  Court  had  nullified  the  High  Court's  proceedings and judgment and 28th  September, 2011 when the respondent approached the  Board  seeking  extension  of time.  Citing  the  decisions  of the  Court  in Karibu  Textile  Mills  Limited  v.  Commissioner  General  (TRA), Civil Application No. 192/20 of 2016 and Vodacom Foundation v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Application No.  107/20 of 2017 (both unreported) for the principle that each day of delay must be accounted for, counsel criticized the Tribunal for granting the extension sought despite the respondent failing to explain away the delay of 117 days.

Coming  to  the  first  ground, Mr. Mayenga  faulted  the  Tribunal's reasoning  in  its judgment,  shown at page 588 of the record of appeal, that

the dispute between the parties was no longer a tax dispute but a claim  by a  taxpayer for  recovery of compensation  for  loss  and  damage  due  to  the mishandling  of the distrained  goods.  By this  reasoning,  he  contended,  the Tribunal  circumvented  the  decision  of this  Court  in  Civil  Appeal  No.  93  of 2009 holding clearly that the dispute was a tax dispute, not an ordinary civil action.

Mr. Mayenga  canvassed  the  second  and  third  grounds  of  appeal conjointly. In essence, his contention was that the enlargement time sought was restricted to the grounds stipulated  by section  16 (5) of the TRAA and that  the  Tribunal  wrongly  invoked  the  provisions  of  section  21  (1)  of the Law  of  Limitation  Act,  Cap.  89  RE  2002  ("the  LMA"),  which  were  plainly disapplied,  to decide the  matter in the  respondent's favour.  He went on to criticize  the  respondent  for  forum  shopping  by  disingenuously  drafting  its claim and filing it in the High Court to evade the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board.  It  was  his  submission  that  the respondent  could not  plausibly attribute the delay to the fact that it litigated in a wrong forum in good faith to warrant enlargement of time.  Relying on five unreported decisions of the Court  in Tanzania  Revenue  Authority v.  Musoma  Textiles  Limited, Civil  Appeal  No.  93  of  2009; Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  v.  Kotra Company  Limited, Civil  Appeal  No.  12  of  2009; Allison  Xerox  Sila  v.

7

Tanzania Harbours Authority, Civil  Reference No.  14 of 1998; and Phiri M.K. Mandari  and  11  Others  v.  Tanzania  Ports  Authority, Civil Application No. 84 of 2013,  Mr.  Mayenga characterized the delay as a result of  tardiness,  ineptitude  and  negligence  on  the  part  of  the  respondent. i Accordingly,  he  urged  us to  allow  the  appeal  and,  as  a  result,  vacate  the Tribunal's grant of extension of time.

Taking cue from his learned friend,  Mr.  Sungwa addressed the fourth ground  of appeal  first,  having  adopted  his  written  submissions.  It was  his contention  that the  delay  was  fully  accounted  for  in  Paragraph  19  of the affidavit of Abdul  Hilal, the Managing Director of the respondent, which was lodged  in  support  of the  application  before  the  Board.  In  that  paragraph, the  delay  is  attributed  to  two  factors:  first,  the  respondent's  mistake  of prosecuting the civil  proceeding,  with diligence and good faith,  in the  High Court  which  turned  out  to  be  a  wrong  forum;  and  secondly,  that  the respondent  spent  some  time  to  find  and  engage  an  advocate  conversant with  tax  litigation  to  handle  the  matter  and  that  after  the  advocate  was engaged  he  spent  time  to  examine  and  study  a  maze  of  voluminous documents on the matter.

I

As regards the first ground of appeal,  Mr.  Sungwa disagreed that the Tribunal  attempted  to  elude this Court's decision  in  Civil  Appeal  No.  93  of 2009  as  contended  by  the  appellant. He  submitted  that  the  Tribunal's statement  alluded  to  earlier  did  not  form  the  basis  of  its  reasoning  and decision.  Coming to the second and third grounds,  Counsel  postulated that the Tribunal did  not anchor its decision  upon section 21  (1) of the LMA but that it drew  inspiration  from  the  principle that  litigating  with  diligence  and good faith  in  a  wrong  forum would  constitute a  reasonable cause in terms of section  16  (5)  of the TRAA.  He  added  that,  on  the  authority  of Henry Munyaga  v.  Tanzania  Telecommunication  Company  Limited, Civil Application  No. 8 of 2011  (unreported),  it was significant that there was no proof that  the  enlargement  of time  granted  by  the  Tribunal  would  cause any prejudice to the appellant.

In  a  brief  rejoinder,  Mr. Mayenga  maintained  that  the  respondent failed  to  account  for  the  117  days'  delay  referred  to  earlier  and  that  the Tribunal  heavily  but erroneously relied  upon  section  21  (1) of the  LMA.  He insisted that  the  Tribunal did not  merely  seek  inspiration  from  those provisions;  it wrongly imported them into the dispute and  relied  upon them heavily.

We have examined the record of appeal and dispassionately considered the oral and written submissions of the counsel from either side as well  as the  authorities  cited.  In  determining  the  appeal,  we  propose to deal  with  the  first ground  of appeal  and  then  tackle  the  second  and  third grounds together. We shall finish with the fourth ground of appeal.

Ahead  of  our  determination  of  the  grounds of  appeal, we  find  it apposite  to reproduce  the provisions  of  section 16 (5) of the TRAA empowering  the  Board  to  enlarge  time  prescribed by  section 16 (3)  for lodging a notice of appeal or instituting appeal in the Board thus:

"The Board or Tribunalmay extend the limit of  time set under subsection  (3)  or subsection  (4)  of this section if  it is satisfied that the failure by a party to give notice of appeal\  lodge an appeal or to effect service to the opposite party party was occasioned by absence from the United Republic, sickness or other reasonable cause, subject so such terms and conditions as to  costs as it may consider just and appropriate/'^ Emphasis added]

We would  observe that while the above  provisions vest  in  the  Board the  power to  enlarge time  on  the  ground  of the  applicant's  absence  from the United Republic or his sickness, delay may also be condoned on account

of  any  "other  reasonable  cause."  It  seems  to  us  that  while  the  first  two grounds  are  somewhat  invariable,  the  phrase "other  reasonable  cause"  is broad and flexible to accommodate a myriad of considerations. As is always the case with discretion, the power under section  16 (5) of the TRAA must be exercised judiciously,  but not capriciously or whimsically.  Settled  also  is the  principle  that  a  superior  court  or  tribunal  cannot  interfere  with  the exercise  of discretion  by  an  inferior  court  or  tribunal  unless  it  is  satisfied that the decision concerned was made on a wrong  principle or that certain factors  were  not taken  into  account.  That  principle  was  stated  in Mbogo and Another v. Shah [1968]  1   EA 93 by the erstwhile Court of Appeal for East Africa, which  has been cited and applied  in  numerous decisions of this Court.  The  relevant  passage  is  as  per Sir Clement de  Lestang  VP,  at  page 94, thus:

"I  think  it  is  weii  settled  that  this  Court  will  not interfere  with  the  exercise  of its  discretion  by  an inferior court unless it is satisfied that the decision is clearly wrong, because  it  has  misdirected itself or because it has acted on  matters  on which it should not have acted or because it has failed to  take into  consideration  matters which it should have taken into consideration

## and in doing so arrived at a wrong conclusion. ^[Emphasis added]

Having made the above remarks, we now deal with the first ground of appeal.  The  complaint  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  finding  that  the  dispute between the parties ceased to be a tax dispute but a claim for recovery of loss and  damage  assails  an  observation made  by  the  Tribunal in its judgment,  as  shown  at  page  588  of  the  record,  to  which  Mr.  Mayenga referred to. The relevant passage reads thus:

"Furthermore, the  dispute  has,  indeed,  ceased to be one on a disputed tax -an issue that the parties  have  themselves  already  resolved  and is  now  one  concerning  recovery of loss and damage resulting from  wrongful seizure and mishandling of the taxpayer's property. In addition,  even if one assumes that this matter still involves  a dispute  on  forfeiture under  the two exempted  laws, we  think  that  the  generality  of section  16  (5)  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act should wide enough to allow the Board to invoke the inspiration provided  by  the  principle under section 21 (1) of the Law of Limitation Act, at least with regard to the grounds for extension o/'t//ne/,[Emphasis added]

Admittedly, the above observation,  in our view,  may seem  somewhat inadvertent.  Nonetheless,  we  understood  it as an  opinion  that the  dispute between  the  parties  was  no  longer  a  contest  on  the  magnitude  of  tax payable  by  the  respondent  but  a  claim  for  recovery  of  loss  and  damage suffered due to the mishandling of the distrained  property. We see nothing suggesting that the Tribunal perceived the dispute as an ordinary civil claim to which the provisions of the LMA would have fully applied. To be sure, the Tribunal was conscious that the Board had the sole original jurisdiction over the  intended  proceeding,  it  being  one  of  a  civil  nature  in  respect  of  a revenue  law administered  by the Tanzania  Revenue Authority,  in  terms of section  7 of the TRAA and that an appeal from the  Board  lay to it in terms of section  11  (1)  of the sarpe  law,  In  this sense,  the complaint  in the first ground is but an attempt to make a mountain out of a molehill. We dismiss it.

We hasten to say that the complaints in the second and third grounds of appeal are equally unmerited. To begin with, we agree with  Mr.  Sungwa that the Tribunal did not invoke or apply the provisions of section 21  (1) of the  LMA to determine the appeal  before  it;  for,  it was clearly  cognizant that the LMA was inapplicable to that dispute because section 43 (d) of that law disapplied it from forfeiture proceedings under the Customs

(Management and Tariff)  Act  or the  Excise  (Management  and  Tariff)  Act. The Tribunal  noted  that while the dispute  involved  liability for  payment of VAT, it was also partly related to customs and excise.

As shown in the above excerpted passage, the Tribunal clearly stated that  the Board  should have  invoked  "the inspiration provided by  the principle  under  section  21  (1)  of the  Law  of  Limitation  Act,  at  least  with regard  to  the  grounds  for  extension  of  time."  In  view  of  the  apparent fluidity and  flexibility of the  phrase "other  reasonable cause",  the Tribunal was justified to hold that the Board should have invoked the spirit of the principle under section  21  (1) of the  LMA that the time during  which the  respondent was  prosecuting  a  civil  proceeding  in  a  wrong  forum  with due  diligence  and  in  good  faith  ought  to  be  excluded,  which  effectively constituted  a reasonable  cause  for  the  delay. We  go  along  with  the Tribunal's view that there was no indication that the respondent's recourse to the High Court at Mwanza, then followed  up by an appeal to this Court, was done  without  due  diligence  or  without  good  faith.  Indeed,  as  rightly observed  in  the  Tribunal's  judgment  (page  589  of  the  record),  it  was inconceivable that, as a supposedly rational investor, the respondent:

## "wouldput at stake TZS. 2,738,397,579.00 in the full knowledge that the course he had taken was deadended.... "

Thus, the Tribunal's interference with the Board's decision is fully justified in view  of  the  latter's  misdirection  on  a  vital  consideration  -   see Mbogo i (supra).  Accordingly,  we  hold  that the second  and third  grounds of appeal are without merit and we dismiss them both.

Finally, we determine the fourth ground of appeal. The complaint here is  that  the  Tribunal  erroneously  issued  a  blanket  exclusion  of  the  period within  which  the  respondent  was  litigating in the  wrong  fora  without considering the period under which the respondent was not litigating in any 1 forum.  In  essence,  Mr.  Mayenga  contended  that  the  Tribunal  ignored  a period of 117 days from  1s t  June,  2011 when the Court of appeal  issued its decision in Civil Appeal  No.  93 of 2009 and 28t h  September,  2011 when the respondent  applied  to  the  Board  for  an  extension.  We  interpose  here  to remark  that  although  the  judgment  of  this  Court  referred  to by  the appellant  was  dated  1s t   September,  2011,  it  is  clearly  shown  on  the  top page that  it  was  handed  down  on  9t h   June,  2011.  That  means  the  delay involved spanned over 111 days.

Admittedly,  the  Tribunal  did  not  specifically  refer  to  the  111  days' delay.  Yet,  it took the view that the  reasons for the  respondent's delay  in lodging the case in the Board justified an extension  under section  16 (5) of the TRAA. With respect, we do not agree with Mr.  Mayenga that the course taken  by  the  Tribunal  amounted  to  granting  the  respondent  a  wholesale exemption.

By way of emphasis, we wish to state that the impugned extension of time is particularly justified  by the peculiar circumstances of this matter. As hinted  earlier,  this  protracted  dispute  started  in  early  2001.  The  parties made  an  effort  to settle it out  of  court, which  culminated  with  the establishment  of  a  joint  probe  committee  whose  report  was  signed  in December,  2005.  Between  2006 and  2011,  the  matter was  pursued  in  the High  Court,  and  later  in  this Court,  but this quest was  in  vain  as the  High Court had  no jurisdiction over the matter. All along the  respondent did  not sit idly by;  it has pursued its rights relentlessly. As matters stand, the Board is the only forum where the matter can  be litigated and  both  parties heard on  it. No  doubt  that  the  point  involved  being  the  determination  of  the liability of the appellant as the  revenue collection  agent of the government for alleged wrongful  seizure and  mishandling of a taxpayer's  property is of enormous  legal  significance,  on  the  face  of  it.  In  addition,  it  seems  to  us 16

that the appellant will suffer  no discernible prejudice from the extension of time granted by the Tribunal. Accordingly, the fourth ground of appeal fails.

The upshot of the matter is that the appeal is without merit. It stands dismissed with costs.
