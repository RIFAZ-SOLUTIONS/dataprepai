Dated 16th   day of April, 2015 in Respect of Tax Appeal No. 12 of 2014

## ORDER OF THE COURT

16th  &amp; 23r d   February,2016

## MASSATI, 3.A.:

When  the  appeal  came  up  for  hearing  we  had  first  to contend  with  a  preliminary  objection  raised  by  the  respondent, notice of which had been filed earlier on  11/2/2016.

The preliminary objection was to the effect that:

- " The  appeal  is  bad  in  law  for  failure  to comply with  the requirements under Rule 21 of the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunals Rules, 2001 (GN 56 of 2001) which required signing and  certification of  the decision of  the Tribunal  to  the  made  by  all  members  who heard the appeal".

At  the  hearing,  Mr.  Juma  Beleko,  learned  counsel  for  the respondent, appeared to argue the objection. Mr. Audax Vedasto learned counsel  holding  brief for Mr.  Gaudias Ishengoma,  learned counsel appeared for the appellant.

Fortunately,  Mr.  Mr. Vedasto did not contest the preliminary objection. He  readily conceded to  it and  prayed  that the appeal being  incompetent  be  struck out,  with  no order as to costs. On his  part  put  Mr.  Beleko,  agreed  that  the  incompetent  appeal  be struck out with no order as to costs.

Rule  21  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal,  Rules,  2001 (the Rules) is worded as follows:

" After  conclusion of  the hearing  of  the evidence  and submission  of the  parties  the Tribunal shall,  as soon as is practicable make a  decision  in  the presence  of the parties or their advocates  or representatives  and shall cause a copy duly signed and certified by the members  of  the  Tribunal  which  heard  the appeal  to  be  served  on  each  party  to  the proceedings"

In  this  case,  the  decision  of the tribunal  titled  "Judgment" appears  on  pages  157  to  161  of the  record.  This  is  no  doubt  a copy of the decision. At  page  161  beside  each  member's  name the  signal "Sgd" is  indicated. We  do  not  think  that  the  signal "Sgd" beside each  member's name is sufficient evidence that the said  members  did  sign  at  the  end  of the  decision. We  believe that the purpose of requiring the members in the tribunal to sign the  decision  is  not  only  to  authenticate,  but  also  for  the  said members to own the said decision.  This lofty legislative intention could  hardly be achieved if the signal "Sgd" could be accepted to stand  for  the  members'  full  signature. This  is because  such entries  are  vulnerable  to  abuse. That  said,  we  agree  with  the learned  counsel that the copy of the decision that appears in the record of appeal is not signed.

In AMI  PORT  OPERATIONS  (T)  LIMITED  vs  THE COMMISSIONER  FOR  INCOME  TAX  Civil Appeal  No.  28  of 2009 (Dsm) (unreported) we held, that failure by the members to sign the copy of the decision  renders  it defective and this  infects the record of appeal in terms of rule 24(3) of the Rules and rule

96 (2) (e) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2009. A defective record of appeal cannot sustain an appeal in this Court.

For the above reasons we agree that the appeal is incompetent. It is therefore struck out. We make no order as to costs.

Order accordingly.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 23r d  day of February, 2016.
