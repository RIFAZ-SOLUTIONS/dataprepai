## JUDGMENT

## Mussa, 3 }

This  appeal  originates  from  civil  case  No.30  of  2007  instituted  in the court of Resident Magistrate, Tanga.  The  respondent herein was the original  plaintiff,  whereas,  the  appellants,  a  Government  Agency,  were defendants. The suit was over a seizure and subsequent  sale by auctioning;  as is were, effected  by the appellants with  respect to certain, motor vehicles, allegedly, owned  by the respondent. Accordingly, the trial court  was  approached for an order  that the sale was  illegal and; accordingly, null and void. On the premises, it was a further prayer by the respondent that the auctioned property be restituted unto him.

At  some  stage  whilst  the  suit  was  still pending and; it was November  6th   2007,  the  trial court  entered  judgment  in  favour  the respondent,  on  account  that  despite  time  having  been  extended;  the appellants  had  neglected  and/or  refused  to  file  a  written" statement  of * defence.  Although  the  presiding  officer  did  not  go  so  far  as  to  clearly express the  rule on which the order was founded;  given the explanation, his was clearly an exparte judgment. It  is in regard to the order that the appellants  are  all  arms  against  in  a  petition  comprised  of two  points  of grievance.  The  issue  is,  foremost,  whether  or  not  I  need  consider  the substantive merits of the petition at all.

It  seems  to  me  that,  over  the  years,  the  parity  of  reasoning  has been that the proper way to go about  an exparte Judgment is by having it  set  aside  by  the  same  court  that  issued  it.  Such  was,  indeed,  the position of this court as expressed in Mtondo  Vs  Janmohamed (1970)GCD  326;  Mandia  s/o  Mtaturu  Vs  Mtinangi  (1972)  HCD 150. As  it  turns  out,  the  rules  prescribe  a  remedy  for  setting  aside  an exparte  decree; just as,  there  is,  by way of an  appeal,  a  special  remedy against  an  order  refusing  to  set  aside  such  decree.  To  an  aggrieved judgment  debtor,  these  remedies  alone,  and  none  other,  can  be  taken resort  to.  Having  remarked  so  much  by  way  of  a  prelude;  needless  to have  to  glean  over  the  substantive  merits  of the  appeal.  The  appeal  of' which is prematurely resorted to, is struck  out  with costs. Order accordingly.
