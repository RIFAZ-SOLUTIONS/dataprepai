## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

3r d  &amp; 10t h  June, 2020

## MUGASHA. J.A.:

The  appellant,  Geita  Gold  Mining  Limited  (GGML)  has  lodged  this appeal challenging the decision  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal)  which  dismissed  its  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  Board),  in  favour  of  the  respondent,  the Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority the (CGTRA).

The  background  underlying  the  present appeal  is  briefly as follows: The appellant is a Gold Mining Company dealing in mining industry in Geita region.  On June 24th ,  1999 the appellant through  its shareholders entered into a Gold  Mine Development Agreement (the MDA) with the Government of the  United  Republic  of Tanzania  pursuant  to  which  the  appellant  was entitled to enjoy tax incentives stipulated therein.  Between 2009 and 2011, the  appellant  claimed  to  have  engaged  various  non-resident  persons  to perform  technical  services  in  connection  with  its  mining  activities  and  as consideration, the appellant paid fees  for such services which were provided  by affiliate companies  namely;  AngloGold  Ltd, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd,  AngloGold  Australia  and  AngloGold.  Moreover,  during  the  period  in question,  the  appellant  paid  insurance  premiums to  cover  personal  injury or  incapacitation.  In  addition,  the  appellant  made  payments  for  various goods  and  services  supplied  to  it  by  persons  who  did not  have  Tax Identification Number registration.

In  2013  the  respondent  conducted  a  tax  audit  on  the  appellant's business affairs covering years of income 2009 to 2011 with the objective of ascertaining the appellant's compliance in  payment of various taxes. As a result, on  29t h July, 2013  the  audit  findings  communicated  to  the

appellant were to the effect that,  it was  required to remit the withholding tax  at  the rate of 15%  from  payments  made  to  third parties. The respondent alleged that, the appellant was not implementing the withholding  tax  scheme  as  required  under  the  Income  Tax  Act,  2004 having  withheld  tax  at  the  rate  3%  instead  of  15%.  In protest,  the appellant contended that,  in terms of clause 4.5.2 of the MDA Agreement, it  was  obliged  to  withhold  only  3%  of  the  gross  amount  of  payment  in respect of technical services and management fees availed to it irrespective of the  changes  on  the  rate  pursuant to  the  amendment  or  repeal  of the law.

On 2n d  September, 2013 the appellant responded and agreed that the withholding  tax  scheme  on payments  for  technical services  was  not implemented  as  required  by  section  34  (1)  of the  Income Tax Act,  1973 but  maintained  that,  in  terms  of paragraph  4(2)  in  the Third  Schedule to Income Tax Act,  1973 and  clause 4.5  of the  MDA Agreement, the rate to be  withheld  is  3%  and  not  15%  as  contended  by  the  respondent.  The appellant also clarified to the respondent that, the respondent's computation included items  which cover  insurance premium  covering personal injury risk and payments  to individuals without tax payer

identification  number (TIN) which do not attract withholding tax.  However, the  appellant  maintained  that,  the  withheld  rate  of  3%  from  the  gross amount  paid  in  respect  of technical  services  and  management  fees  was correct in accordance with clause 4.5.2 of the MDA Agreement.

On 31s t  December, 2013 the appellant vide a  letter of finalization of the Tax Audit issued to the respondent a withholding tax certificate demanding TZS.  1,819,002,183  as  principal  sum  and  TZS.1,123,875,027  as  interest making a total of TZS.  2,942,877,210.00.  Before the Tax Revenue Appeals Board  (the  Board) the appellant's appeal  was partly allowed to the extent that, the respondent was ordered to vacate the computations made for the year  2009  in  relation  to  payments  made  by  the  appellant  to  non-TIN holders. However, the rest of the respondent's claims were sustained.

Still aggrieved  the  appellant  unsuccessfully  appealed  to  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal)  vide Tax Appeal  No.10  of 2016. Finally,  as  earlier  stated,  the  appellant  has  preferred  the  present  appeal challenging  the  decision  of the  Tribunal  raising  the  following  grounds  of complaint:

- 1.  The  Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  in holding  that the  obligation  to  withhold  income  tax

under clause 4.5 of the Mining Development Agreement  depends  on  the  law  applicable  at  any point in time and that the appellant is not exempted from adverse changes in law.

- 2.  The  Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  in holding that the documents presented by the appellant  do not  clearly categorize  the services rendered as technical or managerial.
- 3.  The Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  in holding  that the  services for which  withholding  tax was remitted  by the appellant cannot be termed as technical or managerial and  that  the applicable withholding tax rate for such services is 15%.
- 4.  The Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  in holding  that  the  BUPA  contract  did  not  meet  the conditions for life insurance as defined under section 3 of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

The  parties  filed  written  submissions  containing  arguments  for  and against the appeal  which were adopted  by the  respective  learned counsel at the hearing of the appeal.

At the hearing, the appellant was represented by Messrs. Allan Nlawi Kileo,  Wilson  Kamugisha  and  Nobert Mwaifwani,  learned  counsel  whereas the  respondent  had  the  services of Mr.  Evarist  Mashiba,  learned  Principal State Attorney,  Ms.  Consolatha Andrew,  Ms. Juliana  Ezekiel and  Mr.  Leyan Sabore,  from  the  respondent's  office.  It  is  Ms.  Andrew  from  TRA  who addressed the Court.

In addressing the 1s t  ground of appeal, Mr.  Kileo faulted the Tribunal to  have  wrongly  concluded  that  the  appellant  was  not  exempted  from adverse changes in the law on the rate applicable on the tax to be withheld by  the  appellant  when  making  payments  to  third  parties.  On  this  he contended  that,  the  appellant's  obligation  to  withhold  tax  is  regulated  by section 34 (2) (e) of the Income Tax Act 1973 (the ITA 1973) and clauses 4 and  10  of the  MDA Agreement.  He argued  this stance to  be geared  at stabilizing  the  tax  regime  for  the  entire  lifespan  of  the  mine  until  its closure.  As  such, he  maintained  that  the  appellant  is  not  obliged  to withhold a sum greater than 3 % from the payments made to third parties. This submission  as well  covers the  2n d   and  3r d   grounds  of appeal  since  it

was contended that, the appellant was obliged to withhold  3  % from the payment made in  respect of technical services availed  by third  parties.  In addition, it was submitted that the Tribunal erred to hold that the supply of materials and  equipment to the appellant were  not directly  related to the extraction of minerals as they did  not meet the threshold of managerial or technical  services  under  section  2  (1)  of  ITA  1973  which  defines  what constitute technical services. On that account, it was argued that since the appellant was  provided  with  technical  services,  it was  obliged  to withhold 3% and not 15% as wrongly concluded by the Tribunal.

In  respect  of  the  4t h   ground  of  appeal,  the  appellant  faulted  the Tribunal  holding to the effect that,  BUPA Insurance contract in  respect of which the appellant  paid  insurance  premium  was  a  year to  year contract and  thus  subject  to  withholding  tax  at  a  rate  of  15  %.  On  this,  it  was argued  that, one, the  premium  was  paid  to  a  company  incorporated  in United  Kingdom  which  is a  non-resident  person  and  not subject to tax  in the United Republic  of  Tanzania. Two, the appellant's obligation to withhold  tax  arises  only  when  the  insurance  premium  has  a  source  in Tanzania. Three, although  under clause 2 the contract of insurance cover is  pegged  to  a  period  of twelve  months' which  necessitates  an  update  in

order to ascertain the  level  of risk which  does  not require entering  into a new  contract; under  clause  1   the  commencement  date  is  22/11/2004 which accommodates the BUPA Insurance contract which qualifies to be a life insurance contract as stipulated under section 3 of the ITA,  1973.

On  the  basis  of the  said  submissions,  Mr.  Kileo  urged  the  Court to allow the appeal with costs.

On  the  other  hand,  the  respondent  challenged  the  appeal.  In  that regard,  Ms.  Andrew  submitted  that,  in  terms  of  clause  4.5  of  the  MDA Agreement, the appellant was obliged to withhold tax from the  payments made to third  parties at the  rate prevailing at any point in time under the existing  law.  She so argued contending that the MDA was not intended to protect third parties because they are not privy to the MDA Agreement. As such,  the appellant was obliged to withhold tax at the  rate of 15  % from the payments  in  question  and  thus,  the  respondent  was  justified  to demand from the appellant the withholding tax at the prescribed rate.

As  to  whether  or  not  services  rendered  to  the  appellant  were technical or managerial, Ms. Andrew argued this to be a factual issue which ought to  have  been  raised  and  resolved  conclusively  before the Tribunal. However,  the  appellant  did  not  discharge  that  burden  as  required  under

section  18 (2) (b) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act CAP 408 RE:  2002 (the TRAA). In this regard,  it was argued that the appellant cannot be heard at this  stage  to  raise  such  factual  issues  in  the  wake  of  the  provisions  of section  25  (2)  of  the  TRAA  which  mandates  the  Court  to  consider  only questions  of  law  and  not  facts.  Besides,  Ms.  Andrew  submitted  that,  the Tribunal  was justified  to  hold  that,  the  services  rendered  to the  appellant were neither managerial  nor technical and were not directly related to the extraction of minerals as envisaged under the provisions of section 2 (1) of ITA,  1973 as amended in 1997.

On the question  as to  whether the  premiums  paid  by the  appellant related  to  life  insurance  or  not,  Ms.  Andrew  countered  the  same  arguing that,  the  agreement  did  not  meet  the  criteria  of  life  insurance  which  is prescribed  under  section  3  (b)  of  ITA,  2004.  Instead,  it  was  a  general insurance  agreement  whose  paid  premium  had  a  source  in  the  United Republic of Tanzania, which attracted withholding tax at the rate of 15% in terms of the  provisions  of sections  83  (b)  and  69  (f)  of the  ITA  2004.  It was  further argued  that, since the appellant  did not discharge  the evidential burden  on  the  type  of  insurance,  such  evidence  cannot  be adduced at this stage because in terms of section 25 (2) of the TRAA, the

Court is mandated to entertain and determine appeals on only questions of law. Finally, Ms. Andrew urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In rejoinder, Mr. Kileo  urged  the  Court  to  invoke  the  purposive approach to interpret services availed to the appellant to be directly related to  the  extraction of  minerals  and in the same  vein, interpret BUPA insurance  agreement  as  a  life  insurance  contract  under  section  3  (b)  of ITA, 2004.  To  back  up  the  propositions, he  urged  us  to  invoke  the purposive  approach  in  line  with  what  we  said  in  the  case  of tu llo w TANZANIA  BV  VS  THE COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  TANZANIA  REVENUE authority, Civil Appeal No. 24 of 2018 (unreported).

We have carefully considered the submissions by the learned counsel and  the  entire  record  before  us.  In  disposing  this  appeal,  we  are  aware that,  the  obligation  to  pay tax  is  a  creature  of statute  under  section  6(1) (a)  and  (b)  of the  Income Tax Act whereby,  in  case of a  resident  person the  criterion is the  chargeable income  for  the  year  of  income  from employment,  business or  investment.  A similar criterion  is  applicable to a non-resident person, but only to the extent that the income has a source in the United Republic of Tanzania. We are equally aware that, though a right of appeal to the Court is a creature of statute  under section  25  (1) of the

TRAA,  in  terms  of section  25  (2)  of the TRAA,  the  Court  is  mandated  to entertain and determine  questions  of  law  only because  the  task  of conclusively  resolving  factual  questions  ends  at the Tribunal.  We  shall  be guided by this statutory principle in resolving the appeal before us.

It is not  in  dispute  that,  according  to  the  MDA  Agreement,  the appellant  is  entitled  to  enjoy  the  tax  incentives  stated  therein.  Also,  the appellant is as well obliged to withhold tax at the rate of 3% from payment made to third  parties  who  supplied  technical  services to the  appellant as prescribed  under the ITA 1973. The parties locked horns on the applicable clauses of the MDA  Agreement  and propriety or otherwise of the applicability of the Income Tax Act of 2004 which  had changed the rate of tax  to  be  withheld  from  3%  to  15%.  Therefore,  in  disposing  the  first ground  of appeal,  the  issue  for  our  determination  is  whether  or  not the obligation to withhold  income tax under clause 4.5 of the MDA Agreement is  static  regardless of the  new  rate of 15  %  subsequent to change of the law.  This takes  us to  scrutinizing  Article 4  clause  4.5  paragraphs 4.5.2  of the MDA which stipulates that:

"The Companies  shall  be liable to withhold  taxes from payments to third parties as may be required by law from

time to time, save that the Companies shall not be obliged to deduct:

4.5.1 (  not  applicable)

4.5.2 any amount greater than 3% from the gross amount of payments in respect of technical services and management fees,  provided\  however,  that where in the  case  of management  fees  the  gross  payment exceeds  2%  of  the  operating  costs, the  amount withheld  shall  not  exceed  20 %."

In terms of the cited clause,  it is common ground that the appellant who was privy to the agreement was legally obliged to withhold taxes from the non-resident third parties who provided services to the appellant. While Mr.  Kileo relied on clause 4.2 of the  MDA Agreement arguing that the rate was intended to be static during the lifespan of the mine. To the contrary, Ms. Andrew argued that the rate was subject to changes made in the law from time to time.

At  the  outset  we  asked  ourselves,  if  following  the  repeal  of  the Income Tax Act  1973, the withholding tax at the  rate of 3%  as stated  in the  MDA  Agreement  continued  to  exist.  In  our  jurisdiction  which  is  the practice  in  the  Commonwealth  jurisdictions,  the  effect  of  repealing  a Legislation  is  that,  unless  the  contrary  intention  appears  the  repeal  does

not revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect.  (See section 32 (1) (a) of the Interpretation of Laws Act [CAP 1   RE.2002].) However,  Mr.  Kileo was of the view that,  clause 4.2 of the MDA Agreement bars the application of new rates of withholding tax which were  intended  to  be  static throughout the  lifespan  of the  mine.  The  said clause 4.2 states as follows:

" Any tax,  duty,  fee or other fiscal impost imposed on the Companies  jointly or severally or on their shareholders  in  respect  of income,  including  dividend income, derived from Mining operations conducted under the Contract Area, or in respect of  any property held or thing done for any purpose authorized or contemplated by  the  Mining  Licence  or  this Agreement shall  be  in accordance with the Income Tax  Act No. 33 o f1973 and Customs tariff  Act No.  12 of 1976,  as amended by the Financial Laws ( Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No. 27 of1977."

It  is  crystal  clear  that  the  tax  and  duties  referred  to  in  the  cited clause are  those imposed  on  the  companies  including  the  appellant whereas  under clause 4.5.2 the  appellant  is obliged  to withhold  tax from payment  made  to  third  parties  and  remit  the  same  to  the  respondent. Therefore,  the  change  in  the  rate  of withholding  through  amendment or

repeal  of the  law,  does  not  in  any  way  affect  the  appellant  who  collects such tax on behalf of the respondent.

Another  question  which  taxed  our  minds  is  how  was  the  appellant affected  by the change of rate considering that its  role  is to withhold  the tax from the  payments  made to third  parties.  In  our considered view,  we are  satisfied  that  the  appellant  cannot  be  affected  in  any  way  being  an agent who withholds the requisite tax on  behalf of the respondent. At this juncture,  apart from  agreeing  with  Ms.  Andrew that the  MDA Agreement was not intended to protect third  parties, we also agree with the Tribunal which  emphasized  that  withholding  tax  is  never  a  burden  to  the  payee because  the  payer's  obligation  is  to  withhold  tax  and  remit  it  to  the  tax authority. Thus, the appellant's complaint that the rate of 3% was intended to  be  static  is  unfounded,  because  the  MDA  Agreement  had  envisaged changes in the  rate of withhold tax from third  parties as  may be  required from time to time.  In this regard, since what was paid  by the appellant to third  parties for services supplied  has a  source in the  United  Republic, the appellant was obliged to withhold tax at the rate of 15% as prescribed  by sections  83  (1)  (b)  and  69  (i)  (i)  of the  ITA,  2004.  Sections  83  (1)  (b) stipulates as follows:

" Subject to subsection (2), a resident person who pays  a  service  fee  with  a  source  in  the  United Republic of Tanzania to a non-resident shall withhold tax from the payment at the rate provided in paragraph 4 (e) of  the First  Schedule."

What constitutes payments that have a source in the United Republic of Tanzania in terms of section 69 (i) (i) of the ITA are payments including service  fees  attributable  to  service  rendered  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania. See  bp  Tanzania  vs  the  commissioner  general  of Tanzania revenue authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  125  of 2015 and SHELL DEEP WATER TANZANIA BV VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL TRA, Civil  Appeal No.  123 of 2018 (both unreported).

In  view  of  what  we  have  endeavoured  to  discuss,  as  correctly concluded  by the Tribunal, the appellant was obliged to withhold tax from payments  made  to  third  parties  at  the  rate  applicable  in  terms  of  the current  law  in  force  relating  to  Income Tax.  We  thus  find  the  1s t  ground not merited.

On the second and third grounds of appeal the appellant faulted the Tribunal  which  on  the  basis  of the  evidence  adduced,  concluded  that the

appellant did  not clearly  categorize  the  services  rendered  as  technical  or managerial. The Income Tax Act,  2004 defines the technical  services and managerial  services  to be  those related directly in the  extraction of minerals as stipulated under section 3 of the ITA, 2004 which states:

"Technical services in respect of  mining operations, means services in respect of earth moving, engineering,  construction  and includes,  geological, geotechnical and metallurgical services or any other like services."

It  was  incumbent  on  the  appellant  to  adduce  the  evidence  on  the nature of services it was provided  before both the  Board and the Tribunal so  as  to  facilitate  a  conclusive  determination  on  the  nature  of  services provided.  We  have  gathered  that,  apart  from  the  Tribunal  stating  the appellant's  failure  to  clarify  what  constituted  technical  and managerial services,  it  went  further  to  scrutinize  Exh.  A5  which  enlists  the  contracts entered  by  the  appellant,  and  concluded  that,  those  services  were  not directly related to the extraction of mineral because: One, the contract for supply of fire detection  and  suppression  system  was  installed  in  a  power station  and  not in  the  processing  plant as alleged  by the appellant. Two, the supply of materials and equipment do not constitute technical services

as envisaged  by the  ITAs  1973 and  2004 and thus, the applicable  rate of the  tax  to  be  withheld  by  the  appellant  is  15%.  In  a  nutshell,  since  the appellant failed  to  establish  if the  services  were  technical  or  managerial, before  the  Board  and  the  Tribunal  this  being  a  factual  issue,  can  the complaint be entertained  by the Court at this stage? Our answer is in the negative. This is not the first time the Court has dealt with that point. The Court was confronted with a similar scenario in among others, the cases of MBEYA CEMENT COMPANY LIMITED VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL TANZANIA REVENUE authority, Civil Appeal No. 160 of 2017 of BULYANHULU  GOLD  MINE  LIMITED  V.  COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  (TRA)  , Consolidated  Civil  Appeals  Nos  89  and  90  of  2015  (unreported).  In  the latter  case,  the  Court  was  called  upon  to  determine  whether  or  not  the equipment  was  used  wholly  and  exclusively  for  the  purposes  of  mining operation. We declined to entertain the issue having observed as follows:

'We agree with the tribunal that this was a question of fact in  terms of section  18 (2)  (b)  of the  Tax Revenue Appeals Act,  the burden of  proof was on the appellant to prove that the said equipment was used wholly and exclusively for purposes of mining operations. In  the  finding  of  the Tribunal, the Appellant had failed to discharge that burden,  this being a  question  of fact it ends there.  This is so

because under section 25 (2) of the  Tax Revenue Appeals Act,  (CAP  408  RE 2002)  appeals  to  this Court  lie  only  on  matters  involving  questions  of law...."

In  the  light  of  said  settled  position  of  the  law,  we  agree  with  the respondent that the issue relating to the nature of services provided to the appellant by third parties was sufficiently dealt with by the Tribunal and, it being a matter of fact; not one of law, it cannot be entertained any further.

Therefore,  since the services  in  which the appellant  remitted  3%  of income  tax  to  the  respondent,  are  neither  technical  nor  managerial,  in terms of section  83(1)  (b)  of the  Income Tax Act,  2004 and  paragraph  4 (c) of the First Schedule, the appellant as a  resident person who paid fees for service was obliged to withhold  15  %  income tax from  payment made to third parties. This renders the 2n d  and 3r d  grounds not merited.

On  the  last  ground  of  appeal,  rival  arguments  were  marshalled  by learned  counsel  on  whether  or  not  BUPA  Insurance  contract  was  a  life insurance contract. What constitutes life insurance is defined under section 3 of the ITA which provides that:

life  insurance"  means  insurance  of any  of  the following classes:

(a) insurance where the specified event is the death of an individual who is the insured or an associate of  the insured; (b) insurance where (i) the specified event  is  an  individual  who  is  the  insured  or  an associate of the insured sustaining persona! injury or  becoming incapacitated; and

(ii)  the insurance agreement is expressed to be in effect for at least five years or without limit of  time and is  not  terminable  by  the  insurer  before  the expiry of  five years except in circumstances prescribed  by the regulations;

(c

........................................

(d  )

.......................................................................................... "

The  plain meaning  of  the  cited provision clearly  shows  that, a contract of life insurance should  be in effect for at least five years without limit  and  not  be  terminable  by  the  insurer  before  the  expiration  of  five years. A twelve-month BUPA insurance agreement was not at all envisaged to  be  life  insurance  contract.  In  this  regard,  we  do  not  agree  with  the appellant's counsel  that BUPA  agreement  which  commenced  in  2004

embraces the twelve  months' agreement being  envisaged  by section  3  of ITA  2004.  We  say  so  because  clause  1   of the  agreement  prescribes the validity period to be twelve months.  Besides, the existence of life insurance for  the  years  of  income  falling  under  the  scope  of the  audit  in  question rendered the claim unproven. On that account, such a claim being purely a factual  issue  cannot  be  raised  at this  stage  because  as  earlier  intimated, the Court on appeal  in  tax  matters,  it entertains only questions of law as stipulated by  section 25  (2)  of  the  TRAA.  That  being  the  case,  the respondent was justified to assess and demand withholding tax at the rate of  15% from the  premium  paid  in  respect of the twelve-month  insurance as per dictates of section 83 (1) (b) of the ITA, 2004.

In  the  premises,  we  decline  Mr. Kileo's invitation  to  invoke  the purposive approach in interpreting the definition of life insurance under the ITA  2004  so  as  to  embrace  the  BUPA  agreement. Before  giving  our reasons, we borrow a leaf from a Book on the Law and Practice of Income Tax by Kanga, Palkhivala and Vyas Volume 1  ninth Edition which contains a collection  of  principles  on  tax  cases  based  on  Indian  Tax  Law  discussing rules of construction  of taxing  statutes.  From  page  26 to  27 of that  Book the author among other things, states as follows:

"A   plethora  of judgments  of Supreme  Court and various High Courts have firmly laid down the rule that a provision for deduction,  exemption or relief should be  interpreted liberallyreasonably and in favour  of  the  asessee, and  it  should  be  so construed as to effectuate the object of the legislature and not to defeat it... the interpretation should lead only to the logical end; it cannot  go to the extent of  reading something that is not stated in the provision. Full effect should be given to the language used in the provision... The provision should be assigned such meaning as would enable  the  assessee  to  secure  the  benefit intended  to  be  given  by  the  legislature  to  the assessee but it  would not be  reasonable  or permissible  for  the court  to rewrite the section or substitute words of  its own for the actual words employed by the legislature in the  name  of giving  effect  to  the  supposed underlying object.  A  construction leading  to absurd results should be avoided.....

[Emphasis supplied]

The  said  quotation  is  in  line  with  the  familiar  canon  of  statutory construction  of plain  language  because it is elementary that, the  meaning

of a  statute must in the first instance,  be sought in the language in which the act is framed. If it is plain, the courts must presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and  means in a statute what it says there and the sole function  of courts  is to enforce  it according  to  its terms and duty  of  interpretation does not arise. See  bp  Tanzania  vs  the COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF THE TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY (supra) and RESOLUTE TANZANIA LIMITED VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL, TANZANIA  REVENUE  authority, Civil Appeal No. 125 of 2017  and republic vs. mwesige geofrey &amp; another, Criminal Appeal  No.  355 of 2014  (both  unreported).  In  view of the  settled  position  of the  law  in  our considered  view,  the  definition  of  what  constitutes  life  insurance  under section 3 of ITA 2004 is in its plain and clear language one which is not be terminable  by  the  insurer  before  the  expiration  of  five  years.  Thus,  the construction  proposed  by  Mr.  Kileo  stretching  the  definition  to  include  a twelve-month  insurance  agreement  apart  from  being  unwarranted,  does not give effect to the underlying object of the Income Tax Act, 2004. Thus, the 4t h  ground of appeal is unmerited and it equally fails.

In  view  of  what  we  have  stated  herein  above,  the  appeal  is  not merited. We uphold the decision of the Tribunal, order the appellant to pay

the demanded withholding tax at the prescribed rate plus interest thereon.
