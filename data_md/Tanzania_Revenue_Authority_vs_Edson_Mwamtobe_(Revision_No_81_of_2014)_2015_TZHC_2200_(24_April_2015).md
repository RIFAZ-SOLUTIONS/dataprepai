- a) For non citation of  relevant  pro  vision of  the la  w .

There  is  another  revision  filed intandem (together)  with  Revision No.-  74  of  2014  that  is  the  Tanzania Revenue  Authority  (Applicant)  in Revision  No.  81  of  2014  filed* the  revision  as  against  Edson  Mwamtobe %   by  a  notice  of application  made (Respondent). The  revision  was  initiated under Rule 24 (1) (2) of the Labour Court Rules GN.

1 ■ * 4 b  the same source In view of the fact that the two Revisions crop from v r and  involve  the  same  parties,  I  have  opted  to  consolidate  them  so  as  to " M two  birds  by  one  stone" c'est-a-dire that  is  to  say  once  Ruling  will involve  all  raised  preliminary  objections  in  Revision  No.  74  of  2014  and Revision No. 81 of 2014.

r Submitting by way of written submission in support of the preliminary 4 f objection  in Revision No.  74  of  2014  the  Respondent  on  whether  the Application  is  based  on  non-citation  of the  relevant  provision  of  the  law, argued  that;  [first  limb  of  his  preliminary  objection]  the  application  for , ' S revision  is  made  under  Section  94  (1)  (b)  (i)  of.  the  Employment  and %. 1 Labour Institution  Act,  the  provision  which  is  unknown  and  never exists  in Tanzania Laws. % # ^

% if f Even if it exists is irrelevant to the current application, that it is a well that unknown and irrelevant provision of the law could not stand to support any established precedent  and the court practice in our  jurisdiction application  before  the  court  he  cited  the  case  of Marcky Mhango  (on

behalf of 684  Others)  Vs.  Tanzania  Shoe  Co.  Ltd and  Tanzania

Leather Associated Industrie s ^ , in which  the  Court  of  Appeal  ruled that:-

%\ The  Respondent in support of his arguments on  wrong citation  cited the Court  of  Appeal decisions in China  Henan  International  Cooperation  Vs. Saivanda K.A. Rwegasira9 . In which the Court of Appeal % # sustained  the  preliminary  objection  that the  application  for  reference  was ft brought under the wrong citation of the law and  held the application to be incompetent., J

It was the views of the Respondent that the Applicant ought to have cited  Section  91  (1)  (a)  (2)  (b)  and  94  (1)  (b)  (i)  of the  Employment and Labour  Relations Act  No.  6 of 20041 0 ,  and  Rule  24  (1)  and  (3),  28  (1)  (c)

9Civil reference No.  22 of 2005

quoted paragraph 5 and 6 of the Applicant's affidavit:-

- (5) That  the  commission  erred  in  law  and  fact  in awarding  the  Respondent  compensation  'of 3  months salaries while the termination was fair.

1

(6)That  the Honourable  Arbitrator  made the order without takihg into account the facts that the Respondent termination was fair ... . 15

He  concluded  that the  said  arguments  and  ground  of Appeal  in  the affidavit  is  fatal  and  renders the affidavit defective  and  on  the  strength  of the above submission the court has to dismiss the Application1 6 .

Replying  to the  preliminary objection  by  Respondent in  Revision  No. 81 of 2014, the Applicant submitted that Section 94 (1) of the Employment % and  Labour  Relations  Act  No.  6  of  2004  provides jurisdiction  to  this  court over  revision  of  Arbitrator's  award  while  Section  91  (c)  of  the  same  Act v % application to apply to the Labour Court for a gives right to any party to an ' ' V ■ -decision to set aside an application arbitration award.

4  -. Jf ' As regard to the issue of res-subjudice the applicant argued that the same  does  not  apply  in  the  present  case  due  to  the  fact  that,  when  the I #  % ,  % Applicant  filed  the  application  before  this  Court,  had  no  knowledge  that there is another  application filed by  the Respondent.  Thence  as  the application for Revision was  filed without knowledge  of  any  existing Application  before this  Court and  in  fact there was  no  suit  pending  in  this or  any  other  court.  The Respondent's  act  of  citing an  application  for

""Respondent quoting the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the applicant's affidavit in Rev. No. 81 of 2014

'°op. cit note 14

revision  before  this  Honourable  Court cannot  prevent the  applicant to file his  Application  which  is  the  right  of  any  party  who  is  aggrieved  by  the decision of Arbitrator1 7 .

On  the  second  limb  of the  preliminary  objection  that the  Applicant's affidavit is incurably defective for containing grounds  of  appeal and conclusion thus offending Rule 24 (3) (b) and (c) of GN.  106 of 20071 8 .'The ' V % y r " ' applicant submitted  that the affidavit in  support of the  present application is  in  conformity  with  Rule  24  (3. )   of  the  Labour  Court  Rules  2007  which provides the way through by requiring the applicant to state material facts, statement  of  legal  issues  arising  from  the  material ..facts  and  the  relief I P * . ?. sought by the Applicant. Therefore what.is contained in Applicant's affidavit I * % is  not  conclusions  and  ground  of appeal  as  submitted  by  the  Respondent . | ^ but material  facts  statement of legal  issues arising  from  the  material  facts and relief sought by the Applicant which is in conformity with the provision ^ % of  the  law  governing  affidavit  supporting  application  in  the  Labour  Court ■   %   v : %K &gt; already cited above1 9 . p

The  Applicant  in  Revision  No.  74  of  2014  replies  to  the  preliminary objection was that, the citation of Section 94 (1) (b) (i) of the  Employment and  Labour  Institution  Act  and  particular  word  " institution!' was  a  slip  of the  pen  and  that  it  is  supposed  to  read  Section  94  (1)  (b)  (i)  of  the Employment and  Labour  Relations Act.  The words " relation 5 " was omitted and  instead  placed  the word " institutiori' and the omission does not cause any injustice to the Respondent he argued.

On  the  cited  case  by  the  Respondent the  case  of Marcky Mhango (on behalf of 684 Others)  Vs.  Tanzania Shoe Co. Ltd and Tanzania Leather  Associated  Industries2 0 . Court  of  Appeal of  Tanzania  the Applicant moved  this court  to disregard the cited case because  the judgment does not bear the  honourable judge's signature2 1 .  The Applicant further  stated  that there  was  no  non-citation  but  rather  a  slip  of the  pen % # y the and  he  also  called  upon  this  court to  disregard  the  cited  authority  b ¥ Respondent  to  wit; China  Henan International Co-operation  Group ' H i.

2jMisc..Civil Case No. 2 of 2004 as quoted by the Applicant in his submission 24 [   1969]  EA as quoted by the Applicant

I  have carefully gone through the record and  in  my view the affidavit of  the  Applicant  is  contrary  to  the  format  in  the  jurat  as  that  which  is prescribed  in  the  Oath  and  Statutory declaration  Act Cap.  34  RE.  2002.  In the  schedule  is  the  Act the  format on  how  the jurat of attestation  should be is clearly indicated. The applicant unfortunately has formulated  his own format and  adopted  it,  this  is  not  proper.  Par  example  [for  example]  the applicant's jurat states like this:w  '%. V

X ... Sworn and delivered by the said William D. Fussi who is known to me personally ...

, % As  it  can be  noted  the  Applicant  format  as  above  shown  is  not ·%. %. % '  -V ' acceptable we do not deliver affidavit as the applicant above states ' 'sworn and delivered..." the words properly shown in the schedule to the Act, are missing.

All  in  all  I  think rightly that on the foregone discussion all  Application .for Revisions consolidated are by and large incompetent, that is to say:-

(2)Revision  Application  No. 81/2014  Tanzania  Revenue Authority (Applicant) Vs.  Edson Mwamtobe (Respondent)

As a final  result I struck out the above mentioned revision Application for being incompetent  before  the court. This court  cannot  grant  an automatic  leave  for  the  parties  to  re-file  proper  applications  for  Revision

lest the law could be turned an  ass and  a   scare crow of the law,  and the Labour Court as a casino whereby a  person tries now and then despite the loss of his money.
