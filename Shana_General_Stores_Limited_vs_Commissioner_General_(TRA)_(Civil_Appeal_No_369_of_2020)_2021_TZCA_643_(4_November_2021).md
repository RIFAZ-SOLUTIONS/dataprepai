## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

22n d  October &amp; 4th  November, 2021

## NDIKA, J.A.:

On appeal  is the decision of the Tax  Revenue Appeals  Tribunal  ("the Tribunal") dated 13t h  August, 2020 in Tax  Appeal No. 13  of 2019 holding that the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board  ("the  Board") had no  jurisdiction to determine an appeal against a  refusal of waiver or reduction of tax deposit by the respondent, the Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority.

The  background  to  the  appeal  is,  briefly,  as  follows:  the  appellant, Shana  General  Stores  Limited,  is  a  company  incorporated in Tanzania engaged in wholesale and retail trade. The respondent conducted a tax audit on the appellant for the years 2011 through 2013, which climaxed with the

issuance of eleven assessments dated 5t h  March, 2015 demanding a total of TZS.  2,757,169,591.00  in  taxes.  Disputing  some  of the  assessments,  the appellant  lodged  seven  notices  of  objection  (Exhibit  A-8)  challenging  the assessed taxes totalling TZS. 2,392,863,987.30. In terms of section 12 (3) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap. 408 R.E. 2010 ("the TRAA"), which was subsequently  repealed  by section  108  of the Tax Administration  Act,  2015 (now Cap. 438 R.E. 2019) ("the TAA"), the appellant was required to deposit TZS. 797,621,329.10 being one-third of the assessed taxes for the objections to be admitted and considered. Unable to satisfy the aforesaid condition, the appellant requested the respondent pursuant to section  12 (4) of the TRAA to  grant  her a  waiver of the  said  obligation  primarily citing  her  precarious financial difficulties. The respondent denied the request vide letters dated 1 s t April, 2015 (Exhibit A-ll).

Discontented, the appellant approached the Board with seven appeals against the respondent's decision. By its decision dated 7t h  September, 2018, the  Board  dismissed  the  appeals,  which  it  had  consolidated  and  heard conjointly. On further appeal, the Tribunal dismissed the appellant's quest on the ground that the Board had no jurisdiction to hear any appeal against the respondent's  refusal  of  waiver.  Relying  on  this  Court's  decision  in Pan African  Energy Tanzania  Limited  v.  Commissioner  General  (TRA),

Civil  Appeal  No.  121  of 2018 (unreported)  (henceforth to  be  referred to as "Pan African  Energy I"), the Tribunal  reasoned  in  its judgment at,  page 337 of the record of appeal, that:

"It has been firmly decided by the Court of  Appeal of Tanzania ...in Pan African case ...  that the appeal before  the  Board  which  did  not  result  from  an objection decision of the Commissioner General was incompetent This  is  the  position  of the  Court  of Appeal  in which all  other  subordinate courts  and  other bodies like quasi-judicial bodies vested with statutory powers  to  deal  with  rights  are  strictly [bound]  to follow ."

The  present  appeal  is  predicated  upon  three  grounds  of  appeal  as follows:

- / ' That the  Tax  Tribunal erred in  law in  holding  that the appeal  was incompetently  placed  before the Board  and  in failing to consider  section 7 of  the Tax Revenue Appeals Act;
- / / ' That the  Tax  Tribunal wrongly interpreted the case of Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited v. Commissioner Genera / (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 121 of  2018 (unreported) in holding that the appeal before the Board without objection decision is incompetent; and
- Hi. That the  Tax Tribunal erred in law for failure to consider grounds of appeal against the Board.

At the hearing of the appeal  before us, Mr.  Alan  Nlawi  Kileo,  learned counsel,  together  with  Messrs.  Wilson  Kamugisha  Mukebezi  and  Stephen Axwesso, learned advocates, stood for the appellant. The respondent had the services  of  Mr.  Cherubin  Ludovick  Chuwa  and  Ms.  Grace  Makoa,  learned Senior State Attorneys.

It was Mr. Axwesso who argued the appeal for the appellant.  Having fully adopted  the written  submissions  lodged  in  support of the appeal,  Mr. Axwesso  faulted  the  Tribunal for relying on Pan  African Energy  I contending  that  the  said  decision  was  inapplicable  to  the  instant  matter. Elaborating, he argued that the said decision did not interpret and apply the old  section  16  (1)  of the TRAA which  was existing  at the time the appeals were lodged in the Board. The said provision at the time read as follows:

"Any  person who is aggrieved by the final determination by the Commissioner General of the assessment of  tax or a decision referred to under section 14 of this Act may appeal to the Board. "[Emphasis added]

The  learned  counsel  elaborated  further  that  the  Court  in  that  case construed section  16 (1) of the TRAA, which, as amended by section  110 of the TAA, currently reads as follows:

"Any  person  who  is  aggrieved  by an  objection decision  of the  Commissioner  General made under the Tax Administration Act may appeal to the Board. "[Emphasis added]

Mr.  Axwesso  referred  us  to  page  1 3   of the  typed  judgment  in Pan African  Energy  I where  the  Court  interpreted  the  above  provision,  as amended, thus:

"From the provision , it is significantly discernible that an appeal to the Board is presently narrowed down  to  an  objection  decision  of  the CG [Commissioner General] made under TAA. It is beyond question that, in the situation at hand, there is, so far, no objection decision of  the CG and, to say the  least,  going  by  the  specific  language  used  in section 16 (1), the purported  appeal  before the TRAB which did not result from an objection decision of  the CG was incompetent "[Emphasis added]

In the premises, Mr. Axwesso argued that since the appellant's appeals to the Board, lodged on 21s t  April, 2015, predated the TAA, which came into force  on  1 s t   August,  2015  vide  Government  Notice  No.  304  of  2015, Pan African Energy I was inapplicable to the instant matter.

Mr.  Mukebezi  weighed  in  referring  to the  statement of appeal  to the Board  at  page  6  of  the  record  that  the  appellant  instituted  the  appeals pursuant to, inter alia, section 6 of the Tax Revenue Authority Act, Cap. 399

R.E. 2002 ("the TRA Act"), which provided for the right of appeal to the Board in  accordance with the  provisions of the TRAA against any decision  of the Commissioner General  in  relation  to  any  act  or  omission  in  the  course  of discharge of any function conferred  upon  him  under the  law set out in the First Schedule to the TRA Act. While acknowledging that the aforesaid section 6 was subsequently repealed by section  102 of the TAA, he maintained that the  appeals to the  Board  were  lodged  when the said  provision  was still  in force.

We should  interpose  here and  observe that the above oral  argument presented on behalf of the appellant is largely in stark contrast to what was argued in the written submissions on record.  Unquestionably, in the written submissions the appellant's counsel went a considerable distance essentially reviewing the  provisions of sections  50,  51,  52  and  53  of the TAA (on tax decisions, objections to tax decisions, decisions on tax decisions and appeals against  objection  decisions  respectively).  To be  sure, these  provisions underpin the current structure providing the avenue for appeals from all tax decisions made by the respondent. We understood the written submissions as being aimed at anchoring the proposition that section 7 of the TRAA vests in the Board "inherent jurisdiction" to deal with all  matters of civil  nature in the  administration  of  tax  laws  in  the  country.  Certainly,  the  appellant's

counsel did not dispute that following the promulgation of the TAA with the attendant amendment of section 16 (1) of theTRAA, a non-objection decision was non-appealable as held in Pan African Energy I. In the premises, we do not find the written argument based on sections 50, 51, 52 and 53 of the TAA relevant given that it was forcefully contended in the oral argument that the TAA was inapplicable to the instant dispute.

Replying, Mr. Chuwa strongly disagreed with his learned friends. Having adopted the written submissions in opposition to the appeal,  he contended that the position in Pan African Energy I interpreting section  16 (1) of the TRAA as amended  by the TAA was applicable to the instant matter on the ground  that  the  TAA,  being  a  procedural  law,  had  a  retrospective  effect. However, he did not cite any authority to support his submission. That aside, he contended that the old section 16 (1) of the TRAA  did not allow an appeal against a refusal of waiver or reduction of tax deposit because such a decision did not  constitute  a  "final  determination"  by  the  respondent. He  then distinguished  the  cases  of Pan  African  Energy  Tanzania  Limited  v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 172 of 2020 (henceforth to be referred to as "Pan African Energy II") and Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority v. New Musoma Textiles Limited, Civil Appeal No. 119 of 2019 (both unreported), which Mr. Axwesso had cited as the basis for the proposition that the Board had  requisite jurisdiction in terms of section 7 of the TRAA to entertain and adjudicate disputes of a civil  nature relating to the tax laws administered by the  respondent.  Specifically on the  latter decision,  he contended that it did not deal with an appeal against refusal of waiver but that it was only relevant to the state of the law prior to the promulgation of the TAA in 2015 following which  an  appeal  in  terms  of  section  16  (1)  of  the  TRAA  is  restricted  to objection decisions only.

In  a  brief  rejoinder,  Mr.  Axwesso  submitted  that  the  respondent's refusal  of  a  waiver  or  reduction  of  the  payable  tax  deposit  is  a  final determination,  hence  appealable  in  terms  of the  old  section  16  (1)  of the TRAA and that the TAA had no retrospective effect to deny the appellant the said  right  of appeal.  He  maintained  that  the  two  cases  his  learned  friend sought to distinguish from  the  instant case aptly supported the contention that the Board had requisite jurisdiction in terms of section 7 of the TRAA to entertain  and  adjudicate  disputes of a  civil  nature  relating  to  the tax  laws administered by the respondent the matter at hand being one such dispute.

Having examined the  record of appeal  and taken  account of the oral and  written  submissions  for  and  against  the  appeal,  we  think  the  appeal principally turns on the question whether the Tribunal  rightly held that the

Board  had  no  requisite jurisdiction  to  hear  and  determine  the  appellant's appeal against the rejection of the application for tax deposit waiver.

It is common  ground  that  the  Court  in Pan  African  Energy  I interpreted section 16 (1) of the TRAA, as amended by the TAA, to the effect that an  appeal  to the  Board  only  lies against  an  objection  decision  by the respondent made under the TAA and that a refusal of waiver or reduction of the quantum of the tax deposit is non-appealable. That position was recently cemented by the Court in Pan African Energy II referred to by both parties. It is undoubted that the appellant's appeals to the Board, lodged on 21s t  April, 2015,  predated  the TAA,  which  came  into  force  on  1 s t  August,  2015  vide Government  Notice  No.  304  of  2015.  However,  as  indicated  earlier,  the learned counsel disagreed on whether the said decision had any bearing on the present dispute.

We find it apt to cite with approval a holding made by the High Court (Hamlyn, J.) in Benbros Motors Tanganyika Ltd. v. Ramanlal Haribhai Patel [1967] HCD n. 435 that:

"When a new enactment deals with rights of action,  unless it is so expressed in the Act, an existing right of action is not taken away, but when it  deals with  procedure only\ unless the contrary is  expressed,  the  enactment applies  to  all actions,

whether commenced before or after the passing of the Act "[Emphasis added]

The Court in Makorongo v. Consigilio [2005] 1  EA 247 took the same position, quoting with approval the statement of principle made by Newbold, J.A.  of the defunct East Africa Court of Appeal  in the case of Municipality of Mombasa v. Nyali Limited [1963] EA 371, at 374 that:

"Whether or not legislation operates retrospectively depends on  the  intention  of the  enacting  body as manifested by legislation. In seeking to ascertain the intention behind the legislation the Courts are guided by certain rules of  construction. One of these rules is  that  if  the  legislation  affects  substantive rights it will not be construed to have retrospective operation unless a dear  intention to  that  effect  is  manifested; whereas  if  it affects procedure only, prima facie it operates retrospectively unless there is good reason to the contrary :  But  in the last  resort  it  is the intention behind the legislation which has to be ascertained  and a  rule of construction  is only one of the  factors to which regard must be had in order to ascertain that intention. "[Emphasis added]

See  also  the Director of  Public  Prosecutions  v.  Jackson  Sifael Mtares &amp; Three Others, Criminal Application No. 2  of 2018; and Felix H.

Mosha &amp; Another v. Exim Bank Tanzania Limited, Civil  Reference No. 12 of 2017 (both unreported).

The essence of the old and current section  16 (1) of the TRAA is the same:  both provide for the right of appeal against specified decisions of the respondent. We think it is too plain for argument that such  provision is not merely procedural  but substantive.  For it enacts a specific statutory right of appeal, which, being a right of action, is substantive in nature. Thus, the right of  appeal  under  the  old  provision  could  not  be  taken  away  upon  the presumption that the new enactment operates retrospectively. Since the TAA does not expressly provide for retroactivity of the new section  16 (1) of the TRAA,  we  agree  with  Mr.  Axwesso  that Pan  African  Energy  I had  no bearing on the present dispute.  In the  premises,  we  hold that the Tribunal slipped  into error  in  following  and  applying Pan African  Energy I to the instant matter wholesale.

The  foregoing  finding  takes  us  to  consider  whether  the  Board  had jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeals under the law as it was at the material time.

It is convenient at this stage to excerpt section  12 of the TRAA so far as it governs the tax deposit waivers in relation to the procedure for objecting to an assessment:

- " 12.-(1 )  Any person  who  disputes  an  assessment made  upon  him  may,  by  notice  in  writing  to  the Commissioner General, object to the assessment

## (2) [Not relevant]

- (3)  Where a notice of objection to an assessment is given , the person objecting shall,  pending the final determination of the objection to an assessment by the Commissioner General in accordance with section 13, pay the amount of tax which is not in dispute or one third of the assessed tax,  whichever amount is greater.
- (4) The  Commissioner  General  may, upon  being satisfied  that  there  exist good  reasons  warranting reduction or waiver of  tax  payable in accordance with the requirement of  subsection (3), direct that  a lesser amount be paid or waive the required tax deposit.
- (5) On  receipt  of  the notice of  objection, the Commissioner General shall -
- (a)  admit the notice of objection  to assessment of tax; or

- (b) refuse  to  admit  the  notice  of  objection  to assessment of  tax.
- (6)  The  Commissioner  General shall not refuse  to admit the notice of objection  to assessment of tax unless -
- (a) the notice does not comply with the requirements of  subsections (1), (2) or (3);
- (b)  the notice does not raise any question of  law or fact in relation to the assessment;
- (c) the  relief sought cannot be granted in  law or equity;
- (d)  the objection is time barred; or
- (e)  the objection is otherwise misconceived.
- (7) [Not relevant]
- (8) Any person who is aggrieved with the refusal by the  Commissioner  General  to  admit  the  notice  of objection may, on depositing with the Commissioner General the amount of tax assessed which is not in dispute or one third of the amount of tax assessed, whichever is greater,  together with the interest due as a result of late payment of the tax in respect of which the notice of  fate payment of  the tax in respect

of which the notice of objection is issued,  appeal to the Board against the refusal and the decision of  the Board on  whether or not the notice of objection be admitted by the Commissioner General shall be final.

## (9) [Not relevant]

(10) [Not relevant]"

It is unmistakable that while subsection (3) above enacts the one-third tax  deposit  precondition  for  admission  of  a notice  of  objection  to  an assessment, subsection (4) vests the respondent with power to direct, where good reason exists, that a  lesser amount be paid or waive the required tax deposit. In terms of subsection (6), the respondent is empowered to refuse to admit a  notice of objection  on account of failure to comply with the tax deposit requirement. Refusal of waiver is appealable to the Board in terms of and subject to the condition stated by subsection (8). The Board's decision is expressly stated as being final.

At this point, two observations are pertinent. First, based on the record of  appeal,  it  does  not  appear  that  the  appellant  appealed  to  the  Board pursuant to section  12 (8) of the TRAA. Secondly, even if that were so, the Board's dismissal  of the  appeal  should  have  been  final,  meaning  that the appellant would have had no recourse to appeal to the Tribunal.

We recall that Mr.  Mukebezi  underlined that the appeals to the Board were made pursuant to section 6 of the TRA Act, which provided for the right of appeal to the Board against any decision of the Commissioner General in relation  to  any  act or  omission  in  the  course  of discharge  of any  function conferred  upon  him  under the law set out in the First Schedule to the TRA Act. The aforesaid section,  repealed  by section  102 of the TAA,  provided at the  material  time  a  broad  and  general right  of  appeal  exercisable  "in accordance with the provisions" of the TRAA. In terms of section 7, the Board is vested with the sole original jurisdiction in all proceedings of a civil nature in respect of disputes arising from revenue laws administered by the Tanzania Revenue Authority.  Nevertheless, the Board was precluded by section 7A of the TRAA from  entertaining  any appeal  arising  from  an  assessment of tax unless the requirements of section 12 of the Act were complied with. It is our respectful  view that the appellant's appeals,  arising  from  tax assessments, were caught up by the web of section 7A of the TRAA.

So  far  as  this  matter  is  concerned,  the  appellant's  appeals  were governed by section 16 (1) of the TRAA whose text we reproduced earlier in this judgment. This provision enacted that an appeal would lie to the Board against  any 1 1 final  determination  by  the  Commissioner  General  of  the assessment of  tax"  or n a decision referred to under section 14 of  the Act."

Certainly, the phrase "final determination by the Commissioner General of the assessment of tax" is not defined by the TRAA but its meaning can be deduced by examining section 13 of the TRAA as it was before being repealed by the TAA in  2015.  The  said  provisions vested  in  the  respondent  powers exercisable  upon  his  receipt  of  the  notice  of  objection  to  determine  the objection. For clarity, we reproduce at length the text of section  1 3  thus:

- "13.-(1) The Commissioner  General  shall, upon admission of  an objection with section 1 2 determine the objection as filed, or call for any evidence as may appear to be necessary for the determination of the objection, and may, in that respect -
- (a) amend the assessment in accordance with the objection;
- (b) amend  the  assessment  in  the  light  of  any further evidence that has been received; or
- (c) refuse to amend the assessment
- (2) Where  the  Commissioner  General  agrees  to amend  the  assessment  in  accordance with the objection, he  shall  serve  a notice of  the final assessment to the objector.
- (3) Where the Commissioner General (a) proposes to amend the assessment in accordance with  the  objection  and  any  further  evidence;  or (b) proposes to refuse  to amend the objection,  he

shall serve the objector with a notice setting out the reasons for the proposal.

- (4) Upon receipt of  the notice pursuant to subsection (3), the  objector  shah ' within thirty  days  make submission in writing to the Commissioner General  on his  agreement or disagreement  with  the proposed amended assessment or the proposed refusal.
- (5) The Commissioner General may, after the receipt of  the submissions by the objector made pursuant to subsection (4) -
- (a) determine  the  objection  in  the  light  of  the proposed amended assessment or proposed refusal and any submission made by the objector; or
- (b)  determine the objection partially in accordance with the submission by the objector; or
- (c)  determine  the objection in accordance  with  the proposed amendment or proposed refusal.
- (6)  Where  the  objector has  not responded  to  the Commissioner  General's  proposal  to amend  the assessment  or  proposal  to  refuse  to  amend  the assessment  served  in accordance with subsection (3), the Commissioner General shall proceed to make the final  assessment  of tax  and accordingly serve  the objector with a notice thereof."

Having carefully examined the above provisions, it is our respectful view that  the  phrase  " final determination  by the  Commissioner General of the assessment of  tax" meant a final decision by the respondent on an objection to amend or refuse to amend an assessment of tax. On that basis, a decision by the respondent on an application for waiver of a tax deposit made under section 12 (4) of the TRAA would not fit within that definition.

It is equally evident that the second limb of 16 (1) of the TRAA enacting the right of appeal against " a decision referred to under  section 14 of  the  A ct had no bearing on the respondent's decisions on applications for tax deposit waiver. For easy reference, we reproduce section 14 of the TRAA thus:

## "14. -(1) Any  person aggrieved by -

- (a) the calculation by the Commissioner Genera! of  the amount due for refund,  drawback or repayment of any tax , duty, levy or charge;
- (b) a refusal by the Commissioner Genera! to make any refund or repayment; or
- (c) the decision  by  the Commissioner  General  to register,  or  refusal  to  register,  any  trader  for  the purpose of  the Value Added Tax Act,

may appeal to the Board.

- (2)  Notwithstanding  subsection  (1),  a  person  who objects a notice issued by the Commissioner General with regards to the existence of liability to pay any tax, duty, fees, levy or charge may refer his objection to the Board for determination.

## (3) [Not relevant]."

The above text speaks for itself. The envisaged  right of appeal to the Board concerned matters enumerated under section  14 (1) (a), (b) and (c), none of which included a decision on tax deposit waiver. It is, therefore, our finding that the Board  had  no jurisdiction  under section  16 (1) of the TRAA as it was at the  material  time to take cognisanze of the appellant's appeal against the respondent's rejection of waiver.

It was also contended for the appellant that the right of appeal against any decision by the respondent is also predicated on the constitutional right envisaged under Article 13 (6) (a) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania,  1977 providing that:

"To ensure equality  before the law, the  state authority shall  make  procedures  which  are  appropriate, or which take into account the following:

- (a) when the rights and duties of any person are being  determined  by  a  court  or  any  other

agency,  the person shall be  entitled to a  fair hearing and to the right of  appeal or other legal remedy against  the  decision  of the  court  or other agency concerned."

So, it was argued that the respondent's refusal entitled the appellant as a taxpayer to obtain legal redress in the form of a right of appeal. That right is  inherent  and  cannot  be  taken  away  by  a  discretion  of  any  judicial  or administrative body because it is tantamount to depriving one of his private property,  which,  in  the  present  case,  is  money  sought to  be  collected  as government revenue before its legality is established. It should be remarked that the respondent did not offer any specific counter argument.

Pertinent to our discussion is the case of Athuman Kungubaya &amp; 482 Others  v. Presidential Parastatal  Sector  Reform  Commission  &amp; Another, Civil Appeal No. 56 of 2007 (unreported) where the Court grappled with the question whether appeals lay to the High Court from the decisions of the defunct Industrial Court of Tanzania. The Court observed in that case, on the  import of Article  1 3   (6)  (a)  of the  Constitution,  that while the  said constitutional  provision  guaranteed,  among  others,  the  individual  right  of appeal, such right would be ensured by appropriate statutory provisions. It is imperative to extract the relevant passage from that decision, at pages 8 and 9 of the typed judgment:

" . . . it  is  at  once  dear  to  us  that  the  Constitution provides and  guarantees the individual  right of  appeal and being heard fully.  The further question arises as to how can the right  to appeal  be achieved  in this case which is the central issue in this appeal. In our view, the answer is not far to seek. As seen from the first part of  sub-article 6 (a), the right to a full and fair hearing as well as the right to appeal would be ensured by an appropriate procedural machinery  put in place by the State Authority."

[Emphasis added]

The Court went on to hold, at page 12 of the typed judgment, that:

"we are settled in our minds that in  Tanzania ...in the absence of a specific provision in the law providing for appeals from the Industrial Court to the High Court,  the appeal could not be entertained in the High Court by invoking the provisions of  Article 13 (6) (a) of  the Constitution. "[Emphasis added]

In the same vein, we hold that the appellant herein could not challenge the  respondent's  rejection  of  the  application  for  a  tax  deposit  waiver  by invoking the above constitutional  provisions on their own in the absence of specific statutory provisions.

That  said,  we  hold  that  the  Board  had  no  jurisdiction  to  hear  and determine appeals against the respondent's decisions on applications for tax deposit waivers. Accordingly, all the grounds of appeal fall by the wayside.

In the final analysis, we hold that the appeal is unmerited. We dismiss it with costs.
