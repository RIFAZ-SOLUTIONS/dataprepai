## Article 25

## Non-discrimination

## [Compare: OECD Model | UN Model]

- 1. The nationals of a Contracting State whether or not they are residents of one of the Contracting States, shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected.
- 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.

This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents, nor as conferring any exemption from tax in a Contracting State in respect of dividends or other payments paid to a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State.

The provisions of the first sub-paragraph shall not prevent a Contracting State from imposing tax, according to the domestic legislation of this State, on income received by a permanent establishment, if the permanent establishment belongs to a joint stock company or similar company resident in the other Contracting State. The taxation shall, however, correspond to the taxation applied with respect to joint stock companies or similar companies resident in the first-mentioned Contracting State on their undistributed profits.

- 3. Except where the provisions of Article 9, paragraph 6 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same condition as if they had been paid to a resident of the firstmentioned State.

Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.

- 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of that first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.
- 5. In this Article the term "taxation" means taxes of every kind and description.

## Article 26

## Mutual agreement procedure

## [Compare: OECD Model | UN Model]

- 1. Where a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Convention, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. This case must be presented within three years of the first notification of the action which gives rise to taxation not in accordance with the Convention.
- 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the national laws of the Contracting States.
- 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.
- 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. When it seems advisable in order to reach agreement to have an oral exchange of opinions, such exchange may take place through a Commission consisting of representatives of the competent authorities of the Contracting States.

- 2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on one of the Contracting States the obligation:
- o carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of (a) t
- that or of the other Contracting State;
- (b) to supply particulars which are not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;
