## RULING OF THE COURT

30th  October, 2017 &amp; 3r d  November, 2017

JUMA, C.J.:

After this Court had on 19/02/2016 struck out Civil Appeal No.  16 of 2014  because the  record  of that appeal  was supported  by a  defective decree,  the  COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  OF  THE  TANZANIA  REVENUE AUTHORITY  has  come  back  to  this  Court  with  a  fresh  appeal,  Civil Appeal  No.  100 of 2017,  which the appellant filed  on  27/04/2017. The

respondent  JSC  ATOMREDMETZOLOTO  has  opposed  this  appeal on various grounds, and also by a preliminary ground of objection contending  that  the  appeal  was  filed  outside  the  prescribed  period, hence it is time barred.

The  background  to  the  dispute  between  the  respondent  and  the appellant traces back to 2010.Then the respondent, which is a company registered  in  the  Russian  Federation,  entered  into  an  arrangement  to purchase shares from an Australian company,  Mantra Resources Limited of  Australia  which  also  happens  to  own  shares  in  Mantra  Tanzania Limited.  Registered  in  Tanzania,  Mantra  Tanzania  engages  in  uranium exploration at the Mkuju River Project.

The  share-purchasing  arrangement  soon  attracted  the  interest  of the  appellant  who  wanted  to  collect  stamp  duty. It was  the  Tax Investigations-Department  (Mwanza)  of  the  appellant  which  set  the motion through a letter dated 18t h October, 2011 to inform the respondent  company  about  its  possible  tax  liability  arising  from  the shares-purchasing  arrangements.  The  exchange of letters  between  the appellant and the respondent drew in  FB ATTORNEYS, the respondent's learned  counsel.  Through  Mr.  G.E.  Ishengoma  and  Mr.  F.A.  Bhojan,

respondent reiterated that the shares-purchasing arrangements referred to  by  the  appellant,  did  not  result  in  any  change  of ownership  of  the shares of  the Mantra  Tanzania Limited. The respondent's counsel expressed  their  readiness  to  provide  further  clarifications,  should  the appellant  require.  The  exchange  of  letter  came  to  a  head  on 30t h November 2011 when the appellant wrote, what has to become a final exchange  of  letters.  Although  the  respondent  was  at the  time  a  nonÂ­ resident  company,  the  appellant  wrote,  it  had  a  source  of  income  in Tanzania  and  therefore  had  the  obligation  to  pay  taxes  in  Tanzania, appellant concluded.

Aggrieved by the outcome  of  the exchange, the respondent initiated Appeal  Number 27 of 2011  in the Tax Revenue Appeals Board at  Dar  es  Salaam  (hereinafter  referred  to  as "the  Board"). At  the Board,  the  respondent  sought two  declarations:  (1)  that the  notice  of liability  issued  by the appellant is unlawful, and (2) that the respondent had no outstanding tax liability. On May 15, 2013, the Board allowed the respondent's appeal,  reckoning that the  respondent is  not liable to tax regime  in  Tanzania,  and  the  appellant  has  no  jurisdiction  to  tax  the respondent company.

Aggrieved  with  the  decision  of the  Board,  the  appellant  lodged  an appeal,  Tax  Appeal No. 16  of  2013, to the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  (The  Tribunal).  On 18/12/2013,  the  Tribunal  dismissed  the matter, concluding that the share purchasing transactions did  not relate to any property in Tanzania to be subject of stamp duty obligations.

After  the  striking  out  of  his  Civil  Appeal No. 16  of  2014, the Appellant sought for an extension of time to file a fresh notice of appeal. The  extension  was  duly  granted  by  the  Tribunal  on  10/3/2016.  The following day the appellant filed  a fresh  Notice of Appeal.  A year later, the appellant lodged this appeal on April 27, 2017.

At  the  hearing,  the  appellant  was  represented  by  Mr.  Salvatory Switi learned advocate. Mr. Fayaz Bhojan learned advocated represented the respondent.  Before allowing the two learned counsel to address us on threshold question whether the appeal is time barred, we engaged them  to comment  on  whether  the Board had requisite jurisdiction  to  determine the  respondent's  appeal  in the  circumstances where  the  respondent  did  not  first  lodge  an  objection  against  Stamp Duty to the Commissioner General  as is implied  by Sections  7,  7A,  12, 14  (2),  16  (1)  and  (3)  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  Cap 408  [R.E.

2010].  After  a   brief exchange,  the  Court  left  open  this  question,  to  be determined in future when a right occasion presents itself to the Court.

Reverting  back  to  the  ground  of  objection  suggesting  that  this appeal  was  in  the  first  place  filed  outside  the  prescribed  time, Mr. Bhojan drew our attention to the period  between  11/03/2016 when  the appellant filed  his notice of appeal and  16/03/2016, when the appellant wrote  a   letter  to  request  for  a   copy  of  the  proceedings,  Rulings  and Drawn Orders.  He submitted that this period should  be counted as  part of the  sixty  days  within  which  the  appellant  was  supposed  to  lodge  a memorandum and  record  of appeal to  initiate this appeal. The  learned counsel  insisted  that  when  the  appellant  finally  filed  the  appeal on 27/04/2017 his appeal was already beyond the sixty days prescribed by Rule 90(1) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009 (the Rules).

Mr.  Bhojan  contended  that  the  appellant  should  have  filed  this i appeal latest by 24/04/2017 which was a Monday, but not as he did on 27/04/2017. Mr. Bhojan cited to us two decisions of the Court to cement his position  that  this  appeal is time  barred: SeeJoseph  Mhina Msumari vs.  Mkurugenzi Mtendaji One Stop Co. Ltd., Civil Appeal No.  12 of 2008 (unreported), and Maneno Mengi Limited and Three

## Others  v. Farida Said Nyamachumbe  and  the  Registrar of Companies [2004] T.L.R. 391.

In  his  replying submissions,  Mr. Switi did  not directly address  the question whether this appeal is time barred as submitted by Mr. Bhojan. He instead questioned the competence of Appeal No.  27 of 2011 which the  respondent had  initiated  in the  Board.  In  his opinion,  the appeal to the  Board  should  have  been  backed  up  by  a  Notice  of Appeal  to  the Board.  He  submitted  further that considering that Notice of Appeal  to the  Board  is  a  mandatory  document  under  Rule  4  (1)  of  the Tax Revenue Appeal Board Rules, 2001 GN No.57 of 2001 (Board Rules), the proceedings,  before  the  Board,  the  judgment  and  the  decree  of  the Board,  are all  defective  for want of support of the  Notice  of Appeal  to the Board. He  further  submitted  that  Rule 7 of  the Board Rules recognizes Notice of Appeal to the Board as a material document, which he contended was not even served on the appellant.

From  the  submissions  of the  two  learned  counsel  for the  parties, and  after  perusing the  record  of appeal,  we are  satisfied  that the  only question  for  our determination  is  whether this  appeal  was  filed  within the prescribed sixty days' limitation period when  it was  filed on 27/4/2017.

The law governing appeals from the Tribunal to the Court begin to flow from the provisions of section  25 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap. 408 R.E. 2006 which provides:

"25.-(1)  Any person  who  is  aggrieved  by  the decision of the  Tribunal may prefer an appeal to the Court of  Appeal."

The procedures governing appeals to this Court from decisions of the Tribunal  is provided for by Rule 24 (3) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal Rules, 2001 GN. No. 56 of 2001 (Tribunal Rules) which states:

"24 (3) An appeal to the Court of  Appeal shall be on matters of  law only and the provisions of the Appellate  Jurisdiction Act  and  the Court  of Appeal Rules,  1979 fnow 2009  Rules )  shall apply mutatis mutandis. "[Emphasis added].

It  is  clear  from  the  above-cited  provisions that  Rule  90  (1)  of the Rules  provides  the  procedure  to  be  followed  by  the  appellants  who intend  to  institute  their  appeals  to  the  Court  from  decisions  of  the

Tribunal. The intending appellants are required to lodge their memorandum of appeal and record of appeal in the appropriate registry, within  sixty  days  of  the  date  when  the  notice  of  appeal  was  lodged. Therefore, the question whether  this appeal was  filed within the prescribed  sixty  days,  will  be  determined  by  looking  at the  sixty  days counted from the date when the notice of appeal was filed, to the date when the appeal is instituted.

It  is  a   common  cause  that the  appellant filed  his  fresh  notice  of appeal  on  11/03/2016,  and  it took another five  days  until  16/03/2016 when  he  applied  to  the  Registrar  of  the  Tribunal  for  a  copy  of  the proceedings which was received on 27/02/2017. There is no doubt from the  record of appeal that the period from the date when the appellant received  a  copy  of the  proceedings to  27/4/2017  when  the  appellant filed  memorandum and record of appeal to initiate this appeal, adds up to a total of fifty nine  (59)  days.  But,  Mr.  Bhojan  has staked a  position that it had  taken  the  appellant  more  than sixty days  to  file his memorandum and record of appeal to be lodged  because of the earlier five (5) days between  11/3/2016 and 16/3/2016 when the appellant had sat  back  after  filing  his  notice  of  appeal.  In  his  reckoning,  the  total

number of days added  up to sixty  four  (64)  days which  is  beyond  the prescribed period of sixty days.

We think Mr.  Bhojan is correct in his conclusions that although  the appellant filed  his  memorandum  and  record  of appeal  fifty-nine  (days) after receiving  the  copy  of  proceedings  from  the  Registrar  of  the Tribunal, he has not accounted for the five days he took no action after the filing  of notice of appeal.  It is also evident from  the  record that on 24/3/2017  when  the learned counsel for the appellant  asked the Registrar  of  the  Tribunal  to  issue  a  Certificate  of  Delay,  he  did not specifically  ask the  Registrar  to  exclude  the  five  days  which  remained unaccounted for. The appellant's request, stated:

"...Kindly take note that we received the Judgment, Proceedings and Decree on 27/02/2017in respect of  the above named Tax Revenue Appeal vide....

However  we  cannot  lodge  our  records  of appeal unless and until we obtain a certificate of  delay in order to  comply  with  Rule  90  (1)  o f the  Tanzania  Court of Appeal Rules, 2009.

In view of  the above we kindly request to be supplied with a certificate of  delay excluding the days from l(?h   March  2016  when  we applied for copies of

the  said  documents  up  to  27th   February  2017 when we received the same to enable us to complete and lodge our records of appeal in the Court of  Appeal of Tanzania accordingly."

It  is  also  clear  from  the  record  of  appeal  that  the  Certificate  of Delay which  the  appellant obtained,  did  not cover the  five  days which the appellant has not accounted for. In so far as the sixty days limitation period  is concerned,  the Certificate of Delay which the  Registrar issued cannot be of any benefit to the appellant.

We think, an intending appellant whose appeal is struck out by the Court,  should  strictly  remain  within  the  prescribed  sixty  days  after  the filing  of notice  of appeal  before  instituting  a  fresh  appeal.  Decisions of the Court are now unanimous that failure of the appellant to institute a civil  appeal  within  the  prescribed  sixty  (60)  days  renders  the  appeal incompetent: For exampleHenry William vs. Anyigulile, Mwasomola, CIVIL APPEAL NO. 81 OF 2014 (unreported).

In result, the  appellant  having lodged  the  memorandum  and record  of appeal  beyond  the  60  days  prescribed  by Rule  90  (1)  of the

Rules,  this appeal  is not competently  before  us.  It is  hereby struck  out.

The costs shall lie where they fall.
