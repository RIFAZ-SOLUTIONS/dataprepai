## RULING OF THE COURT

17th   February &amp; 14th  March, 2016

## MWARIJA, J.A.:

This  appeal  arises from the  decision  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 6/12/2011.  The appellant had appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  against the  respondent's decision  refusing  to  refund to the appellant a  sum of Tshs.  426,421,184/=. The amount was claimed to  be the  duty  which  was  paid  for  fuel  supplied  by  the  appellant  between  2007  and 2008 to foreign  bound  ships. The appellant contended  that on  the  respondent's

consent, it supplied the fuel after it had complied with the requisite conditions for duty drawback  as stipulated under  the East African Community  Customs Management Act, 2004. The Board allowed the appeal and ordered each party to bear its own costs.

Aggrieved by the Board's decision, the respondent successfully appealed to the Tribunal. In  its decision, the Tribunal found that the appellant did  not qualify to the duty drawback scheme and that it was not therefore, entitled to be refunded the  claimed  amount  of Tshs.  426,421,184/=. Dissatisfied  with  the  Tribunal's decision, the appellant preferred this appeal raising one ground of appeal; that:

"The  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  erred in  law  by holding that the Appellant herein does not and did not meet any of the conditions under the duty drawback scheme or under the open system provided for under section  138  of the  East African  Community  Customs Management  Act, 2004 and hence is not entitled to duty drawback under any of  the provisions o f  the law."

After service upon  it of the record of appeal, the respondent filed a  notice of  preliminary  objection  under  Rule  107  (1)  of  the  Tanzania  Court  of  Appeal Rules, 2009  challenging the competence  of  the  appeal. The  preliminary objection,  the  notice  of which  was  filed  O n  12/2/2016,  is to  the  effect that the

appeal is bad in  law for the appellant's failure to comply with  Rule 21 of the Tax Revenue Appeal Tribunal  Rules,  2001, G.N.  No.  56 of 2001  (The Tribunal  Rules) which provides for signing and certification of decisions of the Tribunal.

On  17/2/2016  when  the  appeal  was  called  on  the  hearing,  the  appellant was represented  by  Mr. Martin  Matunda,  learned  counsel  while the  respondent had the services of Mr.  Felix Haule,  learned counsel. We decided to dispose the preliminary objection first.

Submitting  in  support of the  preliminary objection,  Mr.  Haule argued  that the  appeal  is defective  because the  decree of the Tribunal  (the  Decree)  is only signed  by  the  Vice-Chairman  while  it  ought  to  have  been  signed  by  both  the Vice-Chairman and the members of the Tribunal (all members). For that reason, Mr.  Haule  argued,  the  decree  contravenes  the  provisions  of  Rule  21  of  the Tribunal  Rules. To  bolster his argument,  he cited  the decisions of this Court in which  a  similar  issue  was  dealt  with.  The  cases  include Midcom  Tanzania Limited  v.  Commissioner General  (TRA), Civil  Appeal  No.  13  of  2011  and Mbeya Intertrade Company Limited v. The Commissioner General, Civil Appeal  No.  68 'A' of 2010  (both  unreported).  Mr.  Haule argued that the defects renders the appeal  incurably defective. On that submission,  he prayed that the preliminary objection be upheld.

In  response,  Mr.  Matunda  opposed  the  preliminary  objection.  He  argued that Rule  21  of the Tribunal  Rules applies only to decisions of the Tribunal,  not decrees. He contended  that,  since the decision  was signed  and  certified  by all members,  Rule  21  was  complied  with. He  added  that  under  Rule  23  of the Tribunal Rules, issuing of  a decree  is  mandatory  only  for  the  purpose  of execution,  otherwise a  decree  is  not part of the Tribunal's decision  required  by law to be signed and certified by all members.

Emphasizing  his argument,  Mr.  Matunda contended that,  unlike a decision of the  Tribunal,  a  decree  is  not  a  necessary  document  which  an  appellant  is required  to  include  in  the  record  of  appeal. As  to  the  decisions  cited  by  Mr. Haule,  Mr.  Matunda  submitted  that  on  the  basis  of  his  submission,  the  same were given per incuriam. He therefore urged us to disregard them.

In  his  short  rejoinder,  Mr.  Haule  reiterated  his  submission  in-chief stating that, contrary to what was submitted by Mr.  Matunda, a decree of the Tribunal is part of the Tribunal's decision. Relying on section 8 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act  [Cap.  408  RE.  2010]  which  provides  for  composition  of  the  Tribunal,  Mr. Haule argued that since after making a decision, the Tribunal is required to issue a decree, the same cannot be valid unless it is signed by all members who heard and determined the appeal.

From the submissions made by the counsel for the parties, the issue which arises  for  our  consideration  is  a  narrow  one;  it  is  whether  or  not the  appeal  is incompetent for want of a  valid  decree. The  basis of Mr.  Haule's contention  is that the decree is not signed  by all  members. The position as regards the effect of a decree which is not signed by all members has been a subject of decision by this  Court  in  several  cases  including Midcom Tanzania  Limited and Mbeya Intertrade  Company  Limited (supra)  cited  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the respondent. In  all  the cases, the Court held that a decree of the Tribunal which is not signed by all members renders the appeal incurably defective.

Although it is true that Rule 21 of the Tribunal  Rules refers to a decision, a decree is, under Rule 24(3) of the Tribunal Rules, read together with  Rule 96 (2) (e) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009, a  necessary document which a record  of  appeal  must  contain. To  be  valid  therefore,  like  a  decision  of  the Tribunal,  a  decree  must  be  signed  in  the  same  manner  as  the  decision  from which  it arises. In the case of Pembe Flour Mills Limited v. Commissioner General, TRA, Civil  Appeal  No.  50  of  2015  (unreported),  this  Court  stated  as follows:

"In  terms  o f Rule  14(1)  o f the  Tax Revenue Appeals Rules, the  quorum  in  the Tribunal  shall  be three members of whom one shall be the Chairman or Vice-

Chairman. This  means  that  a  decree , just  like  a decision of Tribunal\ must be signed by all members of the Tribunal."

Having so observed, the Court rejected the argument similar to the one made by Mr.  Matunda, that only the decision of the Tribunal  is required to  be included  in the record of appeal as one of the necessary documents for the appeal.

The  learned  counsel  for the  appellant  has endeavoured  to  show that the decisions of this Court which held to the effect that a decree of the Tribunal does not  become  valid  unless  it  complies  with  Rule  21  of  the  Tribunal  Rules,  were given per incuriam. It  is  trite  law  that  although  under  the  principle  of stare decisis, the  Court  is  bound  by  its  own  decisions  it  may  decide  not  to  follow  a previous  decision  where  it  is  satisfied  that  the  same  was  made per incuriam. [See  for  example Mohamed v.  Bakari  and  Others (2005)  2  E.A.  213]. As stated  above,  Mr.  Matunda's argument is based on the interpretation of Rule 21 of the Tribunal  Rules that the provision  does not specifically state that a  decree must  be  signed  by  all  members.  As  a  general  rule,  a  decision  is  held  to  have been  given per incuriam if  it  is  given  in  ignorance  or  forgetfulness  of  some inconsistent  statutory  provision  or  a  binding  authority. In  the  case  of Kiriri Cotton  Co.  v.  R.K.  Dewani (1958)  E.A.  239,  the  Eat African  Court of Appeal quoted  a  passage  in  the judgment of Sir  Raymond  Evershed,  M.R.  who  stated the  principle  in Morelle Ltd v. Wakeling (1955)1 All  E.R.  708  in  the following words.

"As  a  general rule,  the  only cases in  which  decisions should be held to have been given per in  curiam are those of  decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provisions or some authority binding on  the  Court concerned: so  that in such case some part of  the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found on that account, to  be  demonstrably  wrong. This  definition  is  not necessarily exhaustive,  but cases not strictly within it which  can properly be held to have been decided per incuriam must,  in  our  judgment consistently with  the stare decisis rule which is essential features of  our law, be... of  the rarest occurrence...."

Rule  21  of the Tribunal  Rules  under which the  preliminary objection was  based states as follows:

"21. After conclusion of  the hearing o f  the evidence and submissions of  the parties the tribunal shall, as soon as

practicable  make  a  decision  in  the  presence  of  the parties or their advocates or representatives and shall cause a copy duly signed and certified by the members of  the Tribunal which heard the appeal to be served on each party to the proceedings".

In holding that a decree of the Tribunal must comply with the requirements of Rule 21 of the Tribunal Rules, the Court gave a wide interpretation to that provision after reading  it in the context of other provisions thereto and  the Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009.  Rule  24  (3)  of the Tribunal  Rules governs  institution  to  this  Court,  of  appeals  originating  from  the  Tribunal.  It states  clearly that the  Court of Appeal  Rules shall  be applicable.  In  the  case  of Mbeya  Intertrade  Company {supra) for  example,  it  was  stated inter alia as follows:

"...we have no doubt that according to the Tax Revenue Act, Cap  408  [RE  2006], the  Procedure  governing appeals to this court from decisions of the  Tribunal are provided  for  by  Rule  24(3)  of  the Tribunal  Rules. According  to  this  Rule, it  is  the Tanzania  Court  of Appeal Rules,  2009  (the  Rules)  which  shall guide  the primary  documents  which  appellants  are  required  to include in the record of  appeal.  According to Rule 96(2) (e)  of  the  Rules, a  valid  decree  of the  Tribunal  is primary  document  that  shall  have  been  part  of  this appeal."

Clearly  therefore,  Mr.  Matunda's argument  that  the  decisions  of  this Court were given per incuriam is without merit. Apart from relying on  Rule  21  of the Tribunal  Rules,  the  learned  counsel  for the appellant did  not  have any  other material  to  substantiate  his  argument. We therefore find  the  argument entirely devoid of merit.

On  the  basis  of the  foregoing  reasons,  we  hereby  uphold  the  preliminary objection. The appeal which is incompetent for want of a valid decree is  hereby struck out with costs.
