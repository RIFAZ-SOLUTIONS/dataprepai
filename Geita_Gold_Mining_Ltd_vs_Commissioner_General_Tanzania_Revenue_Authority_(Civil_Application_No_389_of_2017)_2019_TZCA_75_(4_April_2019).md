It is on record  that on the 25th  of May, 201S, this Court issued  an order for adjournment, pending clarity on the suppiy of documents requested to by the applicants from trial tribuna:! and relevant to the application.

But that  notwithstanding, upon further consideration of the situation on hand  especially  the advanced position  by  the Respondents,  having  registered  no  objection  to  the applicants prayers.  This Court has considered  the reasons  advanced  in  the supporting affidavit  and submissions submitted  by the applicants for the delay  in filing the documents  within time, as being  due  to the late  supply  of documents, a fact which is not  disputed.
