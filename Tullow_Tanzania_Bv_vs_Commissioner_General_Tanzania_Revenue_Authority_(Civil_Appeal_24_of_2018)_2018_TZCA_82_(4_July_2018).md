## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

27th  June &amp; 5th  July,  2018

MZIRAY. J.A:

The appellant, Tullow Tanzania  BV,  is challenging the decision of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal)  in Tax Appeal  No.  7 of 2013, in  which the said Tribunal dismissed Tax Appeal  No.  10 of 2011  originating from the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) sitting at Lindi. Having been  unsuccessful  in the first and  second appeal, the appellant lodged this appeal seeking to reverse the decisions of the Board and the Tribunal.

The facts of this case are straight forward. As reflected  in the record of  appeal,  in  between  18th   November,  2010  and  1s t  February,  2011  the respondent  carried  out  an  audit  on  the  appellant's  accounts  with  the purpose of verifying  its VAT refund  claims and  along  with the said  audit,  it also  audited  the  appellant's  compliance  with  withholding  tax,  employment tax  and  corporate  tax.  Upon  completion  of the  said  audit,  the  respondent issued three certificates demanding Tshs. 792,394,929/18, Tshs. 29,429,113/09  and  Tshs.  4,298,960/26  being  withholding  tax,  PAYE  and VAT respectively. The appellant paid  immediately both the  PAYE and VAT as assessed but disputed the demand for payment of Tshs. 792,394,929/18,  the  withholding  tax,  contending  that  the  supplier  of  the services  was  non-resident  companies  and  therefore  the  payments  for  the services had no source in Tanzania,  hence not liable to the withholding tax.

The  respondent  on  the  other  hand  consistently  insisted  that  the payments made  by  the appellant  to the non-resident companies  for services  performed  outside  Tanzania  had  a  source  in  Tanzania,  for  that reason,  liable to withholding tax.  The dispute was not resolved.

Following  the  disagreement,  the  appellant  unsuccessfully  challenged the  assessment  in  the  Board  and  opted  for  an  appeal  in  the  Tribunal where  she also lost. She then filed this appeal.

In this appeal, the appellant under the service of Mr. Wilson Mukebezi,  learned  counsel,  filed  a  Memorandum  of Appeal  containing  four grounds namely:-

- "1. The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law when it held that the appellant was the provider o f employment to the  professionals  involved  in the work  for  which payment  was  made  and  that  fees  generated  by  the employment  services  were  subject  to  withholding  tax under  section  6(1)  (b), 69(i)(i)  and  83(1)  (b)  o f the Income Tax Act,2004.
- 2. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred  in law  when it retied  on  section  9  o f  chapter  XVII-B  o f  the  Indian Income Tax Act (as amended  in 2010) which made fees for  technical  services  rendered  outside  India  by  nonÂ­ resident persons  liable  to  withholding  tax  in  India  to conclude  that  if  the  services  are  utilized  in Tanzania withholding tax should apply.

- 3. The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law when it held that extraneous considerations did not influence the Tax Revenue Appeals Board's interpretation o f  law.
- 4. The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law when it held  that  the judgment  o f the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Board as legal and sound instead o f allowing the appeal and dismissing the order for costs.

On  the  above  grounds,  the  learned  counsel  prayed  that the  decision of the Tribunal  be reversed and the appeal be allowed with costs.

To support their respective positions, both parties filed written submissions in compliance  with Rule 106(1) and sub-rule (8) of  the Tanzania  Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009  which  were  adopted  by the  learned counsel at the  hearing  of the appeal.  During the hearing of the appeal, the appellant  was represented by Mr. Allan Kileo assisted by Mr. Wilson Mukebezi,  learned  Advocates  and  the  respondent  enjoyed  the  services  of Mr.  Juma Salum Beleko,  learned counsel.

Submitting  in  support  of  the  appeal  Mr.  Kileo,  learned  Advocate  in the first place asked this Court to adopt a  purposive approach as suggested by  the respondent's learned counsel based on the principle that  tax statutes  are  to  be  construed  according  to  the  clear  words  of the  statute.

He argued that a purposive interpretation of a statute envisages a consideration  of  the  content  and  scheme  of  the  relevant  Act  as  a  whole and  its  purpose. He  stated  that  in  so  doing  a  true  perspective  of the  law can  be  achieved  and  as  such  will  avoid  creating  a  situation  which  is  not contemplated  by  the  legislature. He  made  reference  to  the  following decisions  of  this  Court in support  of  his  argument  Commissioner General  of TRA v.  Pan  African  Energy, Civil  case  No.  146  of 2015  and BP  Tanzania  v.  Commissioner  General, Civil  Appeal  No.  125  of  2004 (both  unreported). He submitted that in the case at hand as services were rendered  in  Dublin,  Ireland  and  South  Africa  which  are  outside  the  United Republic,  then  there  is  no  obligation  to  withholding  income  tax  on  such payments.

He argued that the way section  69(i)(i) of the Income Tax Act,  2004 (the Act) is constructed, due consideration should be placed where utilization of that economic activity  occurs and  not otherwise. He was firm that section 83(l)(b) imposes an obligation for withholding tax on payments  to  non-residents  where  the  source  of  payment  is  the  United Republic but only if the services are performed in Tanzania which is not the case  of  our  instant  case. He  considered  the  decision  in Pan  African

Energy (supra)  as  a  good  law  and  asked  us to  follow  it  in  arriving  at our decision.

Mr. Beleko  learned  counsel  vehemently  opposed  this  appeal. He submitted  that the  essence  of charging  tax  on  the  part of the  appellant  is that  she  defaulted  paying  tax  liable  to  be  paid  by  a  non-  resident  person. He  stated  that  in  terms  of  section  83(l)(b)  of  the  Act  any  person  who effect  payments to a  non-  resident shall  withhold  income tax  and  that the payment of tax has to go with the source  principle as  per section  69(i)(i) of  the  Act. He  submitted  further  that  the  appellant  is  a resident  of Tanzania  and  the  economic  base  on  which  the  tax  is  paid  is  in  Mtwara, Tanzania,  therefore  the  appellant  bearing  in  mind  the  source  principle  in effecting  payment to a  non-resident companies, ought to have withheld tax and remit the same to the respondent.

Commenting  on  the Pan African  case (supra),  the  learned  counsel cautioned that the said decision should  not be relied  upon as the same was erroneously  decided.  He  urged  this  Court  to  depart  from  the  decision.  He maintained that in Pan  African Energy  case (supra) the payment effected  had a source in Tanzania  in terms of section 69(i)(i) of the Act. As

to  the  purposive  approach  in  interpreting  tax  statutes,  Mr.  Beleko  readily conceded that the approach is the best as correctly applied in BP Tanzania case (supra).

In  the  rejoinder submission  Mr.  Kileo submitted that in BP Tanzania case (supra) the scenario is quite distinct from  the  instant case  in that  BP Tanzania  was  interpreting  section  69(e)  on  royalties  for  using  assets  in Tanzania which is quite different from service fees. He rested his submission  by insisting that Pan African  Energy case (supra) was rightly decided in terms of section 69(i)(i) of the Act.

At the outset  we have  to state that we  quite agree  with the proposition that the  purposive approach  may be appropriate in  interpreting tax  legislations. Our  reasons  for  supporting  this  approach  in  this  appeal will  shortly be seen  in the course of arriving at our decision  in this appeal.

We  have  meticulously gone  through  the  entire  record  of appeal  and our  main  focus  has  been  to  determine  how  the  Board  and  the  Tribunal below  dealt  with the matter  in issue and arrived at their respective decisions.  Considering  the  memorandum  of appeal  before  us,  we find  that the  crux  of the  matter  as  pointed  out  in  the  first  ground  of appeal,  which

we  consider  as  the main  decisive  ground, is on  the interpretation of sections 6(1) (b),  69(i)(i) and 83(1) (b) of the Act on which the decisions of the  Board  and  the Tribunal  in  interpreting  the  said  provisions  consensusly concluded  that  the  appellant  was  the  provider  of  employment  to  the professionals  involved  in  the  work for  which  payment  was  made  and  that fees  generated  by  the  employment  services  were  subject  to  withholding tax.

We  propose  to  deal  with  this  appeal  by  arguing  the  four  grounds  of appeal jointly  hoping  that  in  the course  of deliberating  on  the  first ground of  appeal,  we  will  be  able  to  answer  questions  posed  in  the  remaining three  grounds  of  appeal.  We  say  so  because  the  issues  raised  in  the remaining  grounds  of  appeal  originated  from  the  first  ground  and  in  one way or another they are interconnected.

We  begin  with  what  withholding  tax  entails.  This  is  a  tax  that  is required to be withheld by the person making  "payment"  of  certain amounts  to  another person in respect  of  goods supplied or services rendered to satisfy the recipients' tax liability. Section 6 of the Act provides

for  what  is  a chargeable  income. Section 6(l)(b)  speaks  of  what  is chargeable income to a non-resident person.  It provides, we quote;

"6.-(l)  subject  to  the provision  o f sub-section  (2j,  the chargeable  income  of a  person  for  a  year  o f income from any employment business or investment shall be

- (a) ................ N/A
- (b) In the case of  a non-resident  person ; the person's  income  from the employment, business  or investment for the year of  income, but only to the extent that the income has a source in the United Republic."

This  sub-section  imposes  the source  principle in  that  a  non-resident person's income is subject to taxation  under the Act only if the income has a  source in the United  Republic of Tanzania.

Section  69,  defines  in  clear  terms  payments  with  a  source  in  the United  Republic  of Tanzania. And  section  83(l)(b)  imposes  an  obligation for  withholding  tax  on  payments  to  non-residents  to  the  extent  and  only where the source of payment is  in  the  United  Republic of Tanzania. The section  reads;

"S.83.-(l) subject to sub-section  (2),  a resident person who

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

(b) Pays a service fee or an insurance premium with a  source  in  United  Republic  to  a  non-resident person shall withhold income tax from  the payment at the rate provided for in paragraph 4(c) o f  the First schedule."

It was submitted  by the appellant's learned counsel  in the Tribunal at page  195  of the  record  of appeal  that service  fees to  non-residents  has  a source in Tanzania only if the services for which the  payment is  made was rendered/performed in the United  Republic of Tanzania.  This is exactly the wording of section 69(i)(i) of the Act referred above. It provides specifically that:

"The  following  payments  have  a  source  in  the  United Republic.

( 3 ) (h) ............ N/A

(i) Payments', including service fees, of  a type not mentioned in  paragraphs  (g)  or  (h)  or  attributable  to employment exercised, service rendered or a forbearance  from  exercising employment or rendering service

"(i) in  the  United Republic, regardless o f the place o f payment, o r..."

Reading  sections  6(l)(b),  69  (i)(i)  and  83  (1)  (b),  all  together  gives two conditions for a payment  to  a non-resident  to be subjected to withholding  tax. These are: (1)  the  service  of which  the  payment  is made  must  be  rendered  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania,  and (2)  the  payment  should  have  a  source  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania.

The  withholding  obligation  under  section  83(l)(b)  of the  Act  applies to  a payment  for  service  fee  with  a  source  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania  and  section  69  stipulates  what  payment  have  a  source  in  the United  Republic of Tanzania,

It  is  our  strong  view  that  the  word rendered used  under  section 69(i)(i)  is synonymous to words "supplied" or "delivered". In this regard,  a non-resident  who  provides  services  to  a  resident,  has  delivered/supplied services to a  resident of the  United  Republic of Tanzania. The recipient of the service is actually the payer for such services,  in which case, "source of payment" cannot  be  any  other  place  except  where  the  payer  resides. In other  words  as  the  services  of  which  the  payments  were  made  were consumed  or  utilized  by  the  appellant  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania for  purposes  of  earning  income  in  the  United  Republic,  then  payments made for such  services had  a  source in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania, and the respondent had to withhold tax under section 83(1) (c) of the Act.

As  opposed  to  the  Indian  Income  Tax  Act  1961  (as  amended  in 2010),  where  its  section  9  provides  for "income  deemed to  have  a source  in  India/' section  69  of  Tanzania  Income  Tax  Act  deals  with "source  of  payments." These  are  two  distinct  concepts  and  it  is  our considered  view  that  one  cannot  rely  on  an  interpretation  of section  9  of the Indian Income Tax  1961  (as amended) in interpreting section 69 of the Tanzanian Income Tax Act, 2004. While "Income is earned/' "payments  are  made/' in which  case  the  rules  for  determination  of where  a  particular  income  is  earned  cannot  be  the  same  as  the  rules  in determining  where  a particular payment  originates. Payment  ordinarily originates from  where the  payer is,  regardless of where such  payments are effected.

The  Act  imposes  a  withholding  obligation  on  a  service  fee  based  on the  source  of payment  of such  fees,  this  being  the  case  therefore  we  see no ambiguity on section 69(i)(i). The key question that the Court is invited

to  look into  is  not the  nature of the  payment,  but rather, the source where the payment originated.

In our view, the Court's finding in  respect of the case of Pan African Energy (supra)  was  much  influenced  by  the  findings  of the  Tribunal  that section  9(l)(vii)  (c)  of  the  Indian  Income  Tax  Act  is in pari materia with section 69 of Tanzania Income Tax Act.

Section 9(I)(vii)(c) of the Indian Income  Tax  Act, provides as follows:-

"9..(1) -the  following  incomes  shall  be  deemed  to accrue or arise in India.

- (i) (vi) ............ N/A

(vii) Income  by  way  of  fees  for  technical  services payable by

- (a) ............ N/A

(b) A person  who is a non-resident,  where the fees are payable in respect of services utilized in a  business or profession  carried on  by such person  in  India  or for purposes of making or earning any " income from any source in India."

It  is  clear  from  the  wording  of  the  provisions  above  that  they  are substantially  different  from  section  69(i)(i).  While  the  Indian  Act  talks  of

the  source of income,  on  the other  hand  section  69(i)(i) talks  of source  of payment. The case of Pan African Energy (supra) is therefore distinguishable  as  it  relied  on  the  interpretation  of  section  9(l)(vii)  (c)  of the Indian  Income Tax Act to arrive at a finding that the said  provision,  as it was, was in parimateria with section 69(i)(i) of the Act.

We think  it  is  worth  to  note  here  that  sections  69  and  68  of the  Act were  meant  to  deal  with  cross-border  payments.  The  two  provisions  are therefore  anti-avoidance  provisions  as  far  as  cross-border  payments  are concerned.  The  modern  approach  of  interpretation  to  an  anti-avoidance provision  is the purposive approach.  This approach was taken by the Court in the case of BP Tanzania (supra) while interpreting section 69 (e) of the Act. In  doing so the Court gave effect to the purpose for which the section was enacted. This Court,  in the above cited case, stated at page  19 and 20 of the judgment:

"In the prem isesthe focus in the construction o f  section 69(e)  o f  the  Income  Tax  Act  (supra)  is  whether  the payment of a royalty was for the purposes of business ; or  earning  any  income  from  any source  in  the  United Republic  or  services  are utilized  in Tanzania. The moment  these conditions are met, irrespective of

whether payment is done by a resident or non-resident ; the  income  would  be  taxable  in  the  United  Republic. Also  Irrespective  o f the  place  o f rendering  services,  if utilized in  United Republic shall be taxable in the United Republic."

Again  in  the  case  of  African  Barrick Gold  PLC  v.  Commissioner General, Tax  Appeal  No.  16  of 2015,  which  we  take  inspiration,  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  extensively elaborated  the  modern  approach  to interpretation of  anti-avoidance provisions. The  Tribunal after drawing inspiration from various cases from  England,  had this to say on  page  14 of the judgment:

"The  break  through on  both  fronts  came with the decision  o f House  o f Lords in  W. T.  Ramsay Ltd  v.  IRC [1982]  A.C. 300  at  323  C-D. In that  case, Lord WHberforce recognized the general rule that tax statutes are to be construed according to the dear words o f the statute. But  he  posed  the  question "what  are  dear words," and answered it to  the  effect that the  court is not  contained  to  a  literal  interpretation. He  added; "There  may,  indeed should,  be  considered the  context and  scheme  of the  relevant Act  as  a  whole,  and  its purpose may, indeed should, be regarded."

From the above therefore, the respondent's learned counsel  is right in inviting  this  Court to  opt for a  purposive approach  which  would  derive this Court  into  holding  the  decision  by  the  Tribunal  in  the  case  at  hand,  that irrespective  of the  place  of  rendering  services,  as  the  payment  was  made by a person resident in Tanzania, for services utilized in the United Republic,  then  the  payments  made  are  subject  to  withholding  Tax  under the  Provisions of sections 6  (l)(b),  69(i)(i) and  83(l)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

For the reasons aforementioned, we dismiss this appeal with costs.
