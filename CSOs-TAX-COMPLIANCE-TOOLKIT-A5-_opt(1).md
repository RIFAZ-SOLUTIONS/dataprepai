## Acknowledgement

This is the first ever simplified document analyzing Laws, Policies and procedures governing taxation of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Tanzania. The idea of preparing and publishing this Tool Kit was brought up during Civil Society Organizations' Directors Reflection Meeting in Mwanza in 2019.  The idea was well received by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and CSOs across the country. Validation of the Tool Kit was done by representatives from CSOs on 01st July 2021 at Mlimani City Conference Centre, Dar es Salaam.

In  writing  this  technical  work,  TRA  benefitted  a  lot  from  the  intellectual  and  technical  contributions, experiences  and  observations  from  a  number  of  CSOs  who  have  been  approached  for  consultation  in different ways. The list of CSOs that had been consulted is long but we must take this special opportunity to thank them for their efforts and encouragement in developing this work which was time-consuming and needed patience.

Specifically, we would like to thank all organizations that participated to coordinate the process of developing this document: Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC), Wajibu Institute of Public Accountability (WIPA) and financial contribution by the UKaid funded Accountability in Tanzania Programme (AcT2).

We would also like to take this opportunity to thank TRA Technical Team which participated in writing, and all individuals who had, in one way or another devoted their time to give out their ideas and suggestions in shaping this important document for the present and future times. It is our belief that this document will be updated frequently in order to meet all procedural and legal standards that keep on changing from time to time.

## 3.1.5 Withholding Tax on Rent

Nonprofit organisations renting office premises or other spaces are required to withhold tax before making payments to landlords/managing agents.

Most private landlords tend to resist this deduction, however organizations must adhere to the prevailing tax laws as failure to do that attracts fines and penalties. The law requires the tax payment to be done by the tenant, not the landlord.

Religious and Charitable organisations implementing projects relating to health, water, education and infrastructure  are  the  only  NGOs  eligible  for  exemption  under  these  provisions.

<!-- image -->

on imported food, clothing or other goods e.g. shoes for free distribution to orphanages or to schools for children with special needs; or on imported emergency goods for disaster relief; or in case of religious organization, on goods imported for free provision of health, water, education, or religious services and in case where there is any consideration it should not be more than fifty percent of fair market value.

An organisation that is eligible for exemption would make an application for exemption by writing to Commissioner for Customs and Excise before imported goods are cleared through customs.

NB: Nonprofit organization under VAT Act, 2014 means Religious or Charitable organisations

The application will be supported with the following documents;

- · An application letter by the head of the organisation or the one acting on behalf
- · An introduction letter from District Commissioner (DC) where the project is implemented
- · An introduction letter from a Ward Executive Officer (WEO) where the project is implemented
- · Registration Certificate of the respective NGO (Religious/Charitable Organization) from Ministry of  Home  Affairs,  Ministry  responsible  with  Community  Development,  or  from  Registration Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency (RITA)
- · TIN Certificate, and
- · Commercial documents for imported goods (i.e. invoice, bill of lading, packing list)

<!-- image -->

20

- · Organizations utilization report accounting for the remission granted during the previous year (if any)
- · Donation certificate in case of donated goods
- · Distribution plan on the imported goods (especially when imported goods are in a form of general merchandise:
- · Any other relevant information to support the application

Exemption of customs duties for importations by eligible NGOs is effected through payments made by government through Treasury Voucher and Cheque (TVC) procedure. ---

- · A successful applicant will be issued with an exemption letter as approval to be used throughout the  customs  clearance  process.  Importing  organisation  through  appointed  Customs  Agent lodges its declaration to ascertain amount of customs duties required for the imported goods.
- · Thereafter,  the  organisation  would  request  through  Commissioner's  office  payment  from Treasury of the exempted amount. There is a special form to be completed in this regard. The Treasury will issue a cheque with equivalent amount of exempted duties and taxes. The cheque would be deposited to settle the exempted amount and the importer would be required to topup for remaining tax amount where applicable (e.g. VAT and Excise Duty for used items)

<!-- image -->

## Important Points:

- · Timely submission of applications:  Most organisations eligible for exemptions do not submit applications in good time.  Organisations are advised to send the application as early as possible to have the ruling made before arrival of the goods in order to avoid demurrage charges unless the request is related to emergency interventions.
- · Offenses on disposal of Import Duty exempt goods:  When non-profit organisations that have benefited  from  Import  Duty  exemptions  do  not  follow  prescribed  procedures  for  disposal of  related  assets  and  pass  on  the  benefit  to  persons  not  entitled  to  such  benefits  they  are committing an offense (Under section 119 of the EACCMA, 2004).
- · Accountability  for  past  exemptions:  For  accountability  purposes,  organizations  receiving exemptions are required to provide utilization reports accounting for the remission previously granted (and asset disposal procedures wherever applicable)

- · its profit is ploughed back and used solely for improving or expansion of the original or charitable purpose or function. Public character means the benefits of the organization are directed to the community or a section of the community and not to individuals based on their personal identities

<!-- image -->

## 'Public Character'is two fold:

## (i) Non-discriminatory in terms of beneficiaries

Mkombozi Trust provides medical services to a restricted section of villagers, who are identifiable by their personal characteristics, say teachers from three primary schools only and not available to other members of the village. As such the entity does not qualify as possessing a public character as the beneficiaries of the services are earmarked as the teachers that can be identified by their names and the service is not available to other villagers.  If the services were made available to all members of the village or even part of the village without restriction, then the organisation assumes public character even if it was established in order to provide service to a specific group of people.

## (ii) Non-discriminatory in terms of membership

Mambo Mazuri NGO in its constitution expresses its  members as Joshua,  John,  Amos  and  Anna exhaustively.

Waungwana NGO in its constitution  express  its  members  as  Octavian,  Kanasia,  Nyamtondo  and Mallya. It further express that any Tanzanian of full age and with common interest can apply and become a member to the organisation.

Mambo Mazuri NGO above, does not qualify as an entity of 'Public character' whereas, Waungwana NGO's qualifies.

## Worked Example No.1

Suppose the income of the organization from its charitable business is TZS. 250,000,000 excluding TZS. 50,000,000/= received by way of voluntary contributions. It is assumed that the income applied for the purposes of the trust is TZS. 180,000,000.

| TRANSACTION PARTICULARS                                               | AMOUNT      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Income from charitable business for the year ended Dec 2019 Voluntary | 250,000,000 |
| contributions deemed income Under section 64(2)(a)                    | 50,000,000  |
| Income from charitable business for the year of income                | 300,000,000 |
| Less: Income applied in pursuit of its functions                      | 180,000,000 |
| Surplus/Unapplied income for the year of income                       | 120,000,000 |
| Less 25% of gross receipt (additional allowance)                      | 75,000,000  |
| Income chargeable to tax at corporate rate of 30percent               | 45,000 ,000 |

It is important to note that as deliberated above , the maximum non-application of income admissible is 25 percent of the total income of the organization (that is 25 percent of TZS 300,000,000.) which is TZS 75,000,000. The balance of unapplied income in the amount of TZS 45,000,000 is liable to tax during the year of income.

## Worked Example No.2

Suppose the income of the organization from its charitable business is TZS. 300,000,000 including TZS. 50,000,000 received by way of voluntary contributions and that, the income applied for the purposes of the trust is TZS. 230,000,000.

| TRANSACTION PARTICULARS                                               | AMOUNT      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Income from charitable business for the year ended Dec 2019 Voluntary | 250,000,000 |
| contributions deemed income Under section 64(2)(a)                    | 50,000,000  |
| Income from charitable business for the year of income                | 300,000,000 |
| Less: Income applied in pursuit of its functions                      | 230,000,000 |
| Surplus/Unapplied income for the year of income                       | 70,000,000  |
| Less 25% of gross receipt (additional allowance)                      | 75,000,000  |
| Income chargeable to tax at corporate rate of 30percent               | (5,000,000) |

Since unapplied income of TZS 70,000,000 from charitable business of an Organisation is less than acceptable allowance of TZS 75,000,000.it then follows that, there is no income chargeable tax for the year of income.

## Worked Example No.3.

MS Trust is a charitable Organisation providing charitable services in Tanzania. During year 2017, it had income  of  TZS  15,000,000  of  which  TZS  12,000,000  was  applied  toward  charitable  functions.  Since unapplied income of TZS 3,000,000 was less than 25percent of the total income, the amount was not taxed.

During year 2018, the Organization derived income of TZS 25,000,000 of which TZS 10,000,000 was applied towards its charitable functions. The Organisation applied to the Commissioner to be allowed to save TZS 8,750,000 to be applied towards its functions in the year 2019. The Commissioner allowed saving of the amount2. The balance of TZS 6,250,000 which is TZS 25,000,000 less TZS 18,750,000 (TZS 10,000,000+TZS

8,750,000) was not taxed. The Organisation ceased to be a charitable Organisation in the year 2019 before applying to its functions the amount of TZS 8,750,000 saved from its charitable business in the year 2018. The Organisation made income of TZS 16,000,000 during year 2019.

## From this example, taxable income of the organisation will be calculated as follows

| TRANSACTION PARTICULARS                              | AMOUNT     |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Business income for year 20-9                        | 16,000,000 |
| Additional chargeable income                         | 3,000,000  |
| Exempt amount in year 2017                           | 6,250,000  |
| Exempt amount in year 2018 Amount saved in year 2018 | 8,750,000  |
| Taxable income for year 2019                         | 34,000,000 |

- 2 An amount saved by a charitable organization or religious organization will not attract tax liability in the year of income. However, if the saved funds are applied for purposes other than the purposes for which they were saved or the organization ceases to be a charitable organization or religious organization, the amount previously saved will be taxed as income for that year of income.
