GEITA GOLD MINING LIMITED...............................................APPELLANT

## VERSUS

COMMISSIONER GENERAL TANZANIA

REVENUE AUTHORITY  .......................................................RESPONDENT

(Appeal from the judgment and decree of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal, at Dar es Salaam)

(Twaib, 3.1 )

dated the 23rd  day of February, 2017 in Tax Appeal No. 24 of 2015

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

10t h   &amp; 25t h  June,  2019

## KITUSI, J.A.:

This  appeal  arises  from  a  dispute  over  taxes  imposed  by  the respondent on fuels and lubricants that were imported by the appellant. Tanzania Revenue Authority, henceforth referred to as TRA or respondent, raised a demand for payment of a total of TZS. 2,039,696,116.00  to be made  by  Geita Gold Mining Limited, the appellant,  being  road  toll  and  fuel  levy  for  the  said  fuel  for  the  years 2013, 2014 and 2015.

The appellant has been disputing the demand and  unsuccessfully appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board, vide Consolidated Customs and  Excise Appeals Nos 4,9,16,  and 21 of 2013;  Nos 4,11,19, and 27 of 2014 and;  Nos 2,7, and 8 of 2015. The appellant's appeal to the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  was  equally  unsuccessful. This, therefore, is a third appeal.

Most  of  the  facts  forming  the  background  of  this  case  are, fortunately, not in dispute.  They go thus: -

The appellant is a Mining Company operating within the District of Geita  now  in  the  newly  established  Geita  Region,  formerly  Mwanza Region. By  virtue  of  its  operations,  it  is  a party  to  a  Gold  Mine Development Agreement (MDA) signed between it and the Government of the  United  Republic  of Tanzania. Under Article  6  of the  MDA,  the appellant is entitled to import  all items required for the design, construction, installation and operation of the gold mine, fuels inclusive. The details and relevancy of that agreement  form a basis for considerable discussion in due course.

The appellant is also a  holder of what is known as Special  Mining for  Gold  Licence.  On  29t h   June  2009  the  Government  issued  the  Road and  Fuel Tolls (Remission) (Holders of Special  Mining for Gold  Licence) Order,  2009,  GN.  No  218  of  2009.  Under  this  GN,  holders  of Special Mining for Gold  Licences,  like the appellant, are exempted from  paying road  tolls  and  fuel levy  provided  the  same  is  used  in  the  mining operation of the licenced areas. On 30th  July 2010 another Government Notice was issued by the Government. This is Excise (Management and Tariff)  Remission Fuel Imported by Mining Companies Order, 2010, GN. No.  268  of 2010, which  exempted the appellant as a  Mining  Company from  paying  excise  duty  on  fuel  imported  solely  for  use  in  mining activities.

Thus, the appellant enjoys exemption to taxes  under Article 6 of the  MDA as shown above,  but such enjoyment is subject to conditions set out in the two GNs, that is, GN.  No. 218 of 2009 and GN  No 268 of 2010.  Later these  GNs  were  amended  respectively  by  GN.  No.  190  of 2010  and  GN.  No.  191  of  2011.  The  major  condition  relevant  to  the facts of this case is that the  remission on the fuel  is only valid  as  long as there is no transfer, sale or disposition of the said fuel in any way to

a person other than those entitled to the exemption. Though this fact is not disputed, the interpretation as to what it entails is a cornerstone to the parties7  rival arguments.

So much for the matters of common ground.

It  was  contended  by  the  appellant  that  its  mode  of  operation involves  use of various contractors to  perform  its  mining  activities and that  to  these  contractors  the  appellant  has  an  obligation,  specified under the contracts,  to supply inputs,  including fuels and  lubricants.  It was further contended that the applicant gave fuel to the contractors to perform mining activities on its behalf and that there was no transfer or sale or disposition of the fuel such as to invalidate the remission  under the MDA and GNs.

It is on the above background that the appellant found surprising and  unjustified the  respondent's series of demands for payment of the said  TZS.  2,039,696,116.00  in  total.  The two  contentions  are  strongly disputed  by  the  respondent  who  maintains  that  the  exemption  was solely  for  the  party  to  the  MDA  and  as  the  fuels  in  question  were consumed  by  persons  other  than  the  appellant,  the  exemption  was unavailable.

Both the  Board  and the Tribunal  concluded  that  by allowing  the contractors who did not enjoy similar privileges to use the tax- remitted fuel,  the  appellant  violated  the  condition  stipulated in the  GNs  for enjoyment  of  the remission and  was  liable  to pay  the  taxes  as demanded  by  the  respondent.  Aggrieved,  the  appellant  has  appealed hereto on the following grounds;

- 1.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law by holding that among the conditions set out in GN No 218 of 2009 and GN No 268 of  2010 as amended by GN No 190 of  2010 and GN No 191 of  2011 respectively  for  a mining  company  to  enjoy  fuel exemption  under the  Mining  Development Agreement  with  the Government of Tanzania is that the fuel must be used solely by a mining company in its mining activities;
- 2.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that  as long as  the  contractors  were not enjoying similar privileges as those granted to the mining company the mining company's act of allowing the fuel to be used by the contractor cannot be tax exempt as  that  would  run  contrary  to  the  condition  that  the

exemption would cease the moment any disposition is made to a non-exempt, and;

- 3.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law and in  fact by holding that the act of  Respondent of  issuing demand notices for requiring the appellant to pay excise duty and fuel levy on  the grounds that the fuel imported was consumed by persons other than the appellant was correct  in law.

When  the  appeal was  called for hearing, the parties entered appearance through counsel.  Mr. Wilson  Mukebezi and  Mr.  Allan  Kileo, learned  advocates,  represented  the  appellant  whereas  Mr.  Salvatory Switi,  learned  advocate,  represented  the  respondent.  They  had  earlier filed written submissions in accordance with  Rule  106 of the Rules, the contents of which each adopted before addressing us orally.

To  start,  Mr.  Mukebezi  proposed  to  deal  with  the  three  grounds of appeal by addressing the following issues;

- 1.  Whether  the  Tribunal  was  correct  in  law  in  holding  that  among the conditions set out in GN.  No.  218 of 2009 and GN  No.  268 of 2010  as  amended  by  GN.  No.  190  of 2010  and  GN.  No.  191  of 2011  respectively, for a  mining company to enjoy fuel exemption

under the  Mining  Development Agreement with  the  Government of Tanzania the fuel  must be used solely by a  mining company in its mining activities;

- 2.  Whether the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that as long as the  contractors  were  not  enjoying  similar  privileges  as  those granted  to  the  mining  company,  the  mining  company's  act  of allowing  the  fuel  to  be  used  by  the  contractors  cannot  be  tax exempt  as  that  would  run  contrary  to  the  condition  that  the exemption would cease the moment any disposition is made to a non- exempt and;
- 3.  Whether  the  Tribunal  was  correct  in law  in holding  that  the respondent's  act of demanding excise duty and  fuel  levy on  fuel given to appellant's contractors is lawful and justiciable.

The learned counsel submitted as regards the first issue, that the appellant  and  the  contractors  are  exempted  by  Article  6  of the  MDA from paying taxes on materials or goods imported solely for the mining, so  the  conclusion  by  the  Tribunal  that  the  validity  of  the  exemption ceases when  the  user of the  fuel  is  not the  mining  company  itself,  is wrong. He  submitted  further  that  at  the  appellant's  site  there  is constantly an officer of the respondent who observes and takes note of every activity  and  that this  officer  knows  that the  fuel  in  dispute  was given to the contractors and  utilized  by them  solely for the appellant's mining  activities.  The  submissions  draw  the  attention  of the  Court  to the two  Government  Notices  none  of which,  it  is  contended,  provides that  the  exemption  is  conditional  upon  the  user  being  the  mining company. The learned advocate emphasized that, all the appellant was supposed to do was to see to it that the fuel is utilized for the intended purpose in its mining activities.

Interestingly,  Mr.  Mukebezi  submitted  that  he  was  aware  of our decisions in the cases of; Resolute Tanzania Limited V. Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No.  125 of 2017 and; Geita Gold Mining Limited V. Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  103 of 2017 (both  unreported). In  the  two  cases  we  held  that  by  giving  the  taxexempt fuel  to  its  contractors,  a  Mining  Company  enjoying  remission abuses the attendant conditions regardless of whether or not the fuel is used solely for its mining activities.

However,  Mr.  Mukebezi  has  invited  us to  depart from  our earlier decisions  in  the  two  cases on the ground  that our view on  the  matter did not take into consideration that the fuel was not disposed of or sold or transferred  to the  contractors. He went on  to  point out that there was no sale,  transfer or disposal  of the fuel  because the appellant did not  cease  to  be  the  owner  of  the  same  and  it/she  did  not  receive payment in exchange.

In response  to  the  submissions  on  the  first  issue  Mr. Switi, learned  counsel  submitted  that the  Board  and  the Tribunal  concluded that  what  the  appellant  is  referring  to  as  "giving  of  fuel"  to  the contractors  amounted  to  sale.  The  learned  counsel  referred  to  page 770 -  771  of the  record and submitted that this Court cannot consider matters of fact that have been conclusively and concurrently dealt with by the  Board  and  the  Tribunal. For  that,  he  cited  section  25(2)  Tax Revenue Appeals Act cap 408 of the ITA for the principle that appeals to this Court are only on points of law.

On the suggestion by the appellant's counsel that we depart from our  earlier  decisions,  Mr.  Switi  submitted  that there  is  no  justification

for  us  doing  so  because  in  the Geita  Gold  Mining case  (supra)  we concluded that even "giving" of the fuel is disposition.

The appellant's arguments as regards the second issue is that the Tribunal  erred  in  holding  that on  the  basis of Article  6 of the  MDA the contractors should have imported the fuel for themselves. Mr. Mukebezi submitted that although the GNs  do not mention the Contractor, the Court should take a  purposive approach  by reading the said  GNs together with the MDA. He asked  us to consider the analogy of  a person  who  buys  building  material  for  his  house  and  hires  a contractor  to  build  the  house  by  using  those  materials.  Submitting further, the learned counsel said the appellant had legitimate expectation that the contractors working in  its mines would  be covered by the remission.

On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Switi  countered  the  submissions  on  the second  issue  by  submitting  that the  MDA simply  says that the  Mining Company and  contractors  may import without restrictions  but the said MDA,  he argued,  is subject to laws. The learned counsel submitted  in addition,  that  the  remission  under  the  MDA  does  not  mean  that  the contractors should not pay taxes when they are due.

The  third  issue  is  a  concluding  issue  the  answer  to  which  will automatically  flow  by  disposing  of  the  first  and  second  issues. To which we now turn.

As  our  starting  point  we  think  Mr.  Switi  is  correct  in  submitting that tax appeals to this Court are only on  matters of law and  not facts. This is according to Section 25(2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap 408 RE 2002, as submitted by Mr. Switi, and there are several decisions of this Court to that effect.  See; Shell  Deep Water Tanzania  BV V. Commissioner  General  (TRA), Civil  Appeal  No.  123  of  2018  and; Bulyanhulu Gold Mine Limited V. Commissioner General (TRA), Therefore,  we  are  satisfied  that  what  is  before  us  for  decision

Consolidated  Civil  Appeals  Nos 89  and  90  of 2015,  (both  unreported). The latter case was cited  in the former.  In a way that principle applies to  other  matters  also  coming  to  us  on  second  appeals  in  terms  of Section  5  (2)  (c)  of the Appellate Jurisdiction  Act,  Cap  141  R.E.  2002. is whether the  relevant instruments, that is,  the  MDA and  the  GNs were correctly interpreted by the Board and the Tribunal.

First  of  all,  we  ask  ourselves;  what  do  the  rules  of  statutory interpretation  in  general  require  of us? This question  was deliberated

upon  at  length  in BP Tanzania  V.  The  Commissioner  General  of the  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, Civil  Appeal No. 125  of  2015 referring  to  our  earlier  decision  in Republic  V.  Mwesige  Godfrey and  Another, Criminal  Appeal  (both  unreported). The  bottom-line consideration  is the  language of a  particular statute and  that when  its language is plain, the Court need not go out of its way and interpolate.

Here  we  may  only  repeat  what  we  said  in  the Mwesige  case that:-

"Courts must presume that the legislature says in a statute  what it means and means  what it says: CONNECTICUT HAT'L BANK V. GERMAIN, 122 s. it 1146, 1149 (1992 )."

In  the Resolute Tanzania  case (supra)  the  discussion  on  the rules of interpretation was more specific on tax statutes citing the case of Cape  Brandy  Syndicate  V.  Inland  Revenue  Commissioner (1921)  1   KB  64,  which  Mr.  Switi  has  also  cited  to  us.  The  following paragraph  was  reproduced  in  the  case  of  Resolute,  and  we  see  no harm in reproducing it here;

"It simply means that in taxing one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for intendment. There is no equity about tax. There is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing to be implied... "(at  pg 15)

We now turn to the application of those principles to the case at hand, and here we reproduce the relevant Article 6.1 of the MDA:-

"The Companies  and  their Contractors will incorporate as much locally produced material\ equipment, and  supplies  as  possible  in the construction and operation of  the gold mine and any infrastructure. Nonetheless, the companies and their Contractors shall be entitled to  import  without restriction,  all items required for the design construction, installation and operation of the gold mine, including fuels, spare parts and replacements to the spare parts inventory, subject to compliance with any restrictions imposed  by the Laws of

Tanzania. Provided  that  any  imposts applicable to the importation of  fuel including road toll will be subjected to an annual limit of  us $ 200,000."

The relevant Rules under GN No. 218 of 2009 read:-

- "2.  (1)  This Order shall apply to a  holder of a special  mining  licence  who  has  entered  into Mining Development Agreement with the Government before first of  July, 2009.

## (2) [not relevant]

- 3. (1)  Subject  to  the  conditions  specified  in paragraph 4 , the road and fuel tolls payable on imported or purchased gas  oils  for any sums exceeding US Dollars 200,000 per annum by a holder of  a mining licence for gold and which is required exclusively for use in the production of minerals in the licensed  areas is remitted.

(2) [not relevant]

- 4. The remission granted under this Order shall cease to have effect and the road and fuel tolls shall become  due  and be payable in full as if this Order had not been made in  the said gas oils if the said gas oils are transferred, sold or disposed of  in any way to another  person or are used for  purposes not entitled to enjoy similar privileges as are conferred under this Order."

Those of GN No. 268 of 2010 read:-

"2. Subject to the conditions specified in paragraph  3 and the procedures for remission specified  in  the  Schedule  to  this  Order, the excise duty payable on fuel imported or purchased prior to  clearance  through  customs by mining companies having a Mining Development Agreement (MDA) with the Government  of  Tanzania which  provides  for

remission  of excise  duty  on  fuel  to  be  used solely for mining activities is hereby remitted.

- 3. The remission granted under this Order shall  cease  to  have  effect and  the  excise duty shall become due and be payable in full as if   this Order has not been made if  the said fuel is used  for  other  purposes  or  sold  or disposed of in any way to another person not entitled to enjoy similar privileges as are conferred under this Order."

Two  important  features  are  clear  from  our  reading  of the  MDA and the GNs.  One, the MDA expressly mentions both the company and the  contractors  as  beneficiaries. However,  under  the  GNs  only  the holder of a  mining  licence,  that is the  company,  is  mentioned.  In  due course we shall discuss whether this omission to mention the contractors in the GNs is accidental and should be implied, or not. Two, what  the  MDA  gives  to  both  the  company  and  the  contractor  is  the unrestricted  right to import fuel. We shall  resolve the question whether

this  right  to  import  extends  to  cover  the  right  on  the  part  of  the contractor to use tax- exempt fuel imported by the company.

We now venture to consider those two features. We are decided that since the MDA mentions both the company and the contractor, the exclusion of the contractors in the GNs must have been intentional. We therefore do not accept Mr.  Mukebezi's suggestion that we should imply the  GNs as  including  the  contractors.  In  a Ghanaian case of X-TRA Gold  Mining  Limited V. Attorney General, Writ  No.  Jl/23/2015  of 28 July, 2016 (http//ghalii.org/gh/judgment/supreme-court/2016/57 dated  14th  June,  2019),  the  Supreme  Court was  faced  with  the  issue whether  an  Act  that  had been  enacted  to  repeal certain statutes repealed  even  statutes  which  it  did  not  expressly  mention.  The  court resolved the issue in the following manner:-

"The principle is that when an Act,  in  this case Act 793, contains a repealing section mentioning the Acts which it expressly repeals, the presumption  against  implied  repeal  of  other laws becomes fortified on the principle 'expression  uni  us est exclusion alterius . ' In  the

words of  Lord Blackburn in the case of GARNETT V. BRADLEY (1877-78) 3 App.  Case 944 at 965. In as much as there are certain statutes enumerated which are repealed. Expression  unius  est  exclusion  alterius, and accordingly those statutes and those alone are repealed..."

Although  not  in  all  fours  with  our  case  nor  binding  on  us,  the principle in that case is applicable in supporting our conclusion that the express  mention  of the  company  in  the  GNs  excludes  the  contractors that  are  not  mentioned  thereunder. We  also  feel  satisfied  that  the Tribunal's  observation  that  the  contractors  should  have  imported  the fuel  for  themselves,  was  based  on  the  MDA  which  gives  the  said contractors unrestricted right to do so, same as the company.

Mr. Mukebezi  also  submitted  that  nowhere  do  the  GNs  set  a condition  that  the  fuel  must  be  used  by  the  company  itself.  That  is indeed  true,  but  we  do  not  think  it  was  necessary.  Under  Order  4 reproduced above, there are two conditions to be met by the importer of  fuel.  The  first  is  that  the  fuel  should  not  be  transferred,  sold  or

disposed of in any way to another person. The second condition is that the fuel  must be  used  for the  intended  purpose.  We think since these two conditions exclude the unintended beneficiaries such as the contractors,  it  need  not  have  gone further to  state that the  fuel  must be used by the mining company itself.

The  above  discussion  leads  us  to  conclude  that  the  act  of  the appellant  giving  the  fuel  to  the  contractors  amounted  to  disposition, which  is  a  breach  of  the  condition  under  the  GNs,  and  we  see  no justification  for  reading  into  the  MDA  and  the  GNs  a  meaning  other than  what  is  clear  from  the  plain  language  of those  instruments.  This disposition in our  firm view rightly triggered of  the respondent's demand  for  payment  of  the  taxes.  We  thus  uphold  the  Tribunal's decision in that respect.

We  have  been  invited  to  depart  from  our  earlier  decisions  in Resolute (supra)  and Geita Gold  Mine (supra).  We  note that in the latter case a similar invitation was extended to the Court to depart from the Resolute Case. We think departing from an earlier decision should be  more solemn and justified  than  it is in  this case.  Even the  Rules of this  Court  make  it  clear  that  when  a party  intends  to  suggest  a

departure by the Court from its earlier decision, such intention  must be reflected  in the Written Submissions and special attention to it must be drawn.  That  is  Rule  106  (3)  of  the  Tanzania  Court  of  Appeal  Rules, 2009, as amended. It provides;

"If  the parties intend to invite the Court to depart from one of its earlier decisions,  this shall be clearly stated in a separate paragraph of the submissions to which special attention shall be drawn,  and the intention shall also be restated as one of the reasons".

In the recent amendment to the Rules made by Government Notice No. 344  of  2019,  published  on  26  April  2019,  this  provision  has  been  re­ enacted as sub Rule (4).

But  even  assuming  that  the  omission  to  indicate  in  the  written submission would  not render the prayer invalid, we are not persuaded that there  are  grounds for departing  from  the said  earlier decisions of the  Court.  More  importantly,  even  if there  were  grounds  sufficient  to justify a departure from our previous decisions, we would  still  consider whether  it  is  proper  for  us  to  do  so  in  view  of  what  we  stated  in

Abually  Alibhai  Azizi  V.  Bhatia  Brothers  Ltd. [2000]  T.L.R  288 citing PHR Poole V. R (1960) 1   EA 62.

w   A full court has no greater  powers than a division of  the court... but if it is to be contended that there are grounds,  upon  which the court could act\ for departing from a previous decision of the court, it is obviously  desirable that the matter  should, if practicable, be considered  by a bench of  five  judges."

For the  reasons we have shown  in this case, we answer the first and second issues in the affirmative, that is, the Tribunal was correct in holding that the tax-exempt fuel  must be  used  by the company in the mining  activities.  Also,  the  Tribunal  was  correct  in  holding  that  the appellant's act of allowing the contractors use of the  remitted fuel was a disposition and contrary to the set conditions. The transfer would only have been permissible if it had been done to another holder of a mining licence,  as we held  in  our previous decisions. And  lastly as regards the third  issue,  the  Tribunal  was  correct  in  holding  that  the  respondent's demand for payment of the taxes was lawful. As earlier intimated, after answering the first and  second  issues in  the affirmative,  the  last issue naturally follows suit.

In fine, we dismiss this appeal in its entirety, with costs.

It is so ordered.
