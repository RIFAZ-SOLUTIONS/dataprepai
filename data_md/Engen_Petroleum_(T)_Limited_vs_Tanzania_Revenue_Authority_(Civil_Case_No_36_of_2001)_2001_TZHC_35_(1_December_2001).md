## IN THE HIGH COURT OF TANZANIA (DAR ES SALAAM DISTRICT REGISTRY) AT PAR ES SALAAM

## CIVIL CASE NO.36 OF 2001

## ENGEN PETROLEUM (T) LIMITED........PLAINTIFF

Versus

## TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY.....DEFENDANT

## RULING

## CHIPETA, J.:

The applicant Company in this  suit, Engen Petroleum (T) Limited, is suing  the  defendant/respondent, Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, for, inter alia, a declaration that the defendant's act of  demanding  payment  of Shs.35,372,903 as Value Added Tax is unreasonable and illegal.

After  filing  the  suit,  the  applicant  filed  an  application,  which  is  the subject-matter  of  this Ruling, for a temporary  injunction  restrainingt the respondent  by  itself,  its  agents,  servants  and/or workmen  from  attaching$ the; money  in  its account  it Stanbic  Bank  (T)  Limited 'on  the  pretext,of recovering  VAT'  pending  the  final  determination  of the  main  suit. ^By  an order of this court, the parties learned advocates filed written submissions.Hi  i

I have carefully considered the written submissions. Following decisions  in  the  cases  of (to name but a  few) Giiella v . Cass  man Brown Co. (1973)  E.A.  339, CPC  International v. Zainabu  Grain  Millers, ( C.A.T Civil Appeal no.49  o f 1995), and Attilio  v.  Mbowe,  (1969)  H.C.D.  ri.284^\t is  now well  settled that in order for an  application for a temporary injunction to  succeed,  the  applicant  must  show  that  there  is  a  prim a  facie case  with'a probability  of success  and that if the  application is not granted, the^ applicantmight suffer irreparable  loss which would not adequately be compensated byj an award of damages.

In the  instant  case,  the first question  is  whether  the  applicant  has shown  a printa  facie case  with  a probability  of success  in the main  suit.  The pleadings disclose  that  the respondent  has demanded  from  the  plaintiff payment of Value Added Tax and  was  apparently in the process of attaching the  applicant's Bank Account to  collect  the  sum  due. The  applicant claims that  it  is  not  liable  to  pay  such  tax  by  reason  of its Certificate o f  Incentives issued  by  the Tanzania  investment  Centre  on  2nd  March, 1998 . The respondent's argument is that the Certificate relied upon by the applicant did not include exemption from payment of Value Added Tax .

In  other  words,  the  matter  is  about  collection  of Value Added  Tax. Without  in  any  way  trying  to  prejudge  the  issue  in  dispute,  the  Certificate relied on  by the  applicant was  issued in  accordance with the Financial Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act , 1997. The Certificate makes no reference  to  VAT  which  is  regulated  by  a  different  Act  altogether. As  my learned sister Judge,  Bubeshi, J. pointed out in the case of AGIP (T) Ltd.  V . Commissioner  For  Value  Added  Tax  and Another,  High  Court  (J)ar  es Salaam) Civil Case No. 472 o f 1999:

'Import duty is different  from   Value Added Tax . In terms of  section 3(l)-of  the  Value Added Tax Act No.24 of 1997 which came into effect on  1st July,  1998,  VA Tshall he charged on supply o f  goods or services made after 1/7/98.  There is no mention o f Value Added Tax (in the letter o f  exemption). VA T is indeed an animal of  its own creation the  Value Added Tax Act'.

That  is  the  situation  in  the  instant  case. The Certificate o f  Incentives issued  to  the  applicant  has  no  mention  of VAT. That  being  the  position,  I think  that  it  would  be  overzealous  to  hold  that  the  applicant  has  shown  a prima facie case with a probability of success.

As  to  the  question  of irreparable  loss,  I  do  not  think  that there  can be envisaged  such  loss  to  the  applicant  as  would  not  be  compensated  by  an award of damages.

It  is  also  not  impertinent  to  add  here  that  in  addition  to  the  principles enunciated above, when temporary injunctions are sought to be made against public  authorities  charged  with  the  duty  of collecting  public  revenue,  such application  must  not  be  lightly  granted  by  the  courts. While  the  courts  are duty-bound  to  protect  the  innocent  public  against  abuse  of  power  by  tax authorities,  the  courts  must  not  be  oblivious  of public  policy. My learned brother  Judge, Katiti, ./. expressed a similar view, if  not even  more candidly,  in  the  case  of Mufindi  Tea  Co.'JAmited v. Tanzania  Revenue Authority,  (Dar es Salaam Miscellaneous Civil Cause No.  139 o f 1999 -  as yet unreported) in which he said:

' Tax collection, even if  mistaken, being a statutory duty, mandated to be done by the respondent differences emerging  from differing interpretations, I cannot see any wrong, that would attract a temporary injunction.  I am also o f  the view, that, where the issue o f  public revenue is involved, the Court o f Law should be extremely circumspect, to interfere unduly,  with the collection o f  the same, as so doing might not only be disastrous to essential services being rendered by the Government, but too, might effect the security (of  the) State'.

Regarding  the  question  of balance  of inconvenience,  I  think  that  that should  be  determined  by  considering  the  nature  of the  injury  anticipated  to be  caused. In  the  instant  case,  as  I  have  pointed  out  above,  the  applicant cannot  be  said  to  be  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  injury  since  the  injury  can adequately be compensated by an award of damages and/or costs, for neither of the  parties  can  be  said  to  be,  if I  may  use  the  expression,  a man of straw. " The sum of money involved is by no means colossal.

For  these  reasons,  this  application  fails  and  so  is  hereby  dismissed with costs.
