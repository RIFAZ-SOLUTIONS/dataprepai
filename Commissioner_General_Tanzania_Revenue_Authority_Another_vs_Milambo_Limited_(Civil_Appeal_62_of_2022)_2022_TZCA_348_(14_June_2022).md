## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

JO &amp; 14* June, 2022

## MUGASHA, J.A.

Before us is an appeal against the decision of the High Court at Dar-esSalaam dated 30/4/2021 in Misc. Civil Application  No.  57 of 2020 in which the appellants were respondents. The appellants herein are challenging the ruling of the  High  Court in  Misc.  Civil  Application  No.  57 of 2020  in  which  the  High Court (Feleshi JK as he then was) granted the respondent extension of time to

apply for leave to file an application to seek prerogative orders of certiorari a n d mandamus.

The  essential  background  to  this  appeal  is  briefly  as  follows:  Milambo Limited,  the  respondent herein entered into a  share purchase agreement with Vodacom  Group  Limited  over the shares  held  by the  respondent in Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company. It is discerned  in the record  before us that, on  20/11/2017,  the  respondent sought the  indulgence of the  1 s t  appellant to issue a private ruling in order to confirm if the intended share purchase transfer attracted corporate and capital gain taxes under the Income Tax Act, 2004 (the ITA). The respective private ruling was handed down on  11/1/2018 confirming that  the  corporate  income  tax  was  not  applicable  under  the  intended  share purchase  agreement.  This  prompted  the  respondent  and  Vodacom  Group Limited to sign a share purchase agreement on  15/2/2018 and proceeded with securing various approvals from the Capital  Markets and Securities Authorities and compliance with the  regulatory  requirements for completion  of the share purchase transaction  were  pursued.  After the  share  purchase agreement was executed,  the  1 s t   appellant  revoked  the  private  ruling  on  14/2/2019,  for  a reason  that  its  validity  had  expired.  It  is  on  record  that,  in  respect  of  the

uncompleted  share  purchase  transaction,  the  respondent  sought  and  was granted a second private ruling which was however revoked on 21/9/2019.

Undaunted, the  respondent sought an  administrative  review against the revocation,  but  no  response  was  given  by  the  1 s t   appellant  and  instead,  on 24/9/2019, the 1 s t  appellant notified the respondent on the existing tax liability on sales of shares in Vodacom (T) listed at the Dar-es-salaam Stock Exchange. It was also brought to the attention of the respondent that, since the realization transaction  was  concluded,  a  jeopardy  assessment  was  issued  and  that  the collection  of due taxes was to  be effected through Agency  Notice  in  order to safeguard  the  interests  of  the  Government.  This  was  effected  by  the  1 s t appellant who on 25/9/2019 issued an Agency Notice to the National  Bank of Commerce directing the Bank with  immediate effect, to collect a  sum of TZS. 146,118,017,395.00 from monies held in the Bank Accounts 011105017644 and 01110501763  of  Vodacom  Group  Limited  and  remit  the  same  to  the  tax authority that is, the 1 s t  appellant. On 26/9/2019, the Managing Director of the Bank  notified  the  respondent  on  existence  of the  Agency  Notice.  The  Bank obliged and on 27/9/2019 notified the respondent to have remitted the sum in question to the  1 s t  appellant in  settlement of the capital  gains tax and  stamp duty owed to the respondent.

Discontented  with  the  revocation  of the  second  ruling  and  the  Agency Notice, the respondent lodged a  notice of objection against the assessment of the  corporate  tax  and  stamp  duty.  However,  despite  several  reminders  as alleged,  the  matter was not attended to  by the  1 s t  appellant which  prompted the  respondent to  seek  intervention  of the  2n d   appellant  vide  a  letter  dated 12/1/2020 which also  bore  no fruits.  It is against the said  backdrop, that the respondent opted to seek redress by invoking the remedy of judicial review. As she was already out of time, she applied for an extension of time to apply for leave  to  file  prerogative  orders  of  certiorari  and  mandamus.  The  aforesaid background  is  contained  in  the  paragraphs  1 2   to  1 5 , 21,  24  and  31  of respondent's affidavit  in  support  of the  application  before  the  High  Court.  In addition, what was verified by the respondent in the said affidavit in paragraph 35 (a), (b), (f) and (g) is to the effect that:

- (a) This  Honourable  Court is  the  only organ  in  the United Republic that has inherent powers to provide for prerogative  orders  against  decisions  of administrative bodies and  quasi-judicial  bodies.
- (b) The  Honourable  Court  has  inherent  powers  to provide redresses against the First Respondent's decisions that  are made contrary to and/or in abrogation

of  the law, and  hence the power to grant the application for extension of  time;

- (f) That the acts of the First Respondent constitute substantive unfairness and  procedural impropriety which this Honourable Court has  jurisdiction to provide redresses; and
- (g) That the act of the First Respondent to issue the Agency Notice prior to issuance of the tax assessments and collection of tax of TZS 146, 118,017.395 constitutes an act of  illegality."

The application was confronted with the preliminary objection  raised  by the  appellants  challenging  its  competence  on  ground  that,  the  High  Court lacked jurisdiction  to  invoke  review jurisdiction  to  entertain  and  determine  a matter  related  to  a  tax  dispute.  Having  heard  together  both  the  preliminary objection and  the  substantive application, the preliminary  objection was dismissed  and  the  respondent  was  granted  enlargement  of  time  to  file  an application for leave to apply the prerogative orders. The High Court reasoned that, before it was not a tax dispute or appeal proceedings but rather a matter for judicial review because: one, the provisions of article of 107 A (2) and 108 of the Constitution of the United  Republic of Tanzania  [CAP 2   R.E.2002],  read together with section  17 (2) of the Law Reform (Fatal Accidents Miscellaneous

Provisions) Act [CAP 310 R.E 2019] adequately confer jurisdiction to the High Court to  determine  the  merits  of an  application  seeking  judicial  review  after hearing the  parties where the alternative  remedy is not accessible or speedy, effective and or adequate or if there are other compelling situations warranting just and commensurate orders; and two, the provisions of sections 52 (1) and (11) of the ITA and  section  7 of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act should  not be construed to bar the High Court from acting on matters which do not amount to trials and appeals or where the High Court is justified to exercise its wide range jurisdiction under  the Constitution to curb impunity and malpractice or illegalities committed by administrative bodies and tribunals.

Aggrieved, the appellants have preferred an appeal to the Court predicated on three grounds namely;

- 1.  That, the trial  court  erred  in law by  holding that  it  has  jurisdiction to  invoke judicial review powers  of matters including  matters arising from Revenue  Laws  administered  by  the Tanzania Revenue Authority.
- 2.  That,  the  trial court erred in law and fact by failing to declare that Misc.  Civil  Application No.  57 o f2020 by the respondent for extension of time within  which to challenge the first appellant's revocation of  private ruling and issuance of  agency notice is an

abuse of  court  process since the respondent  had filed tax appeals No.  48  and 50  of 2021  with  the  Tax Revenue Appeal Board challenging the decision.

- 3.  That,  the trial court erred in law and fact for failure to properly apply the governing principles in an application for extension of ti me  requiring  internal accounting  for sufficient  cause  for  the delayed  period.

At  the  hearing,  the  appellants  were  represented  by  Messrs.  Deodatus Nyoni,  learned Principal State Attorney, Erigh Rumisha and Ayoub Sanga,  both learned State Attorneys, whereas the respondent had the services of Ms. Hadija Kinyaka and Mr. Yohanes Komba, learned counsel. Before the hearing, we were constrained to initially resolve a preliminary objection filed  by the respondent's counsel to wit:

"The appeal is  incompetent for  being  preferred from interlocutory orders of the High Court namely, an order overruling the preliminary objection on ground of  lack of jurisdiction  and  an  order  granting  extension  of time contrary to section 5 (2) (d) of  the Appellate Jurisdiction Act,  Cap 141 R.E 2019 and contrary to the decision of the Honourable  Court in  Yara  Tanzania Limited versus D.B Shapriya &amp; Co limited Civil Appeal No.  244 of  2018 CAT  Dar-es-salaam"  (unreported).

Upon  taking the floor, Ms. Kinyaka submitted that the appeal is incompetent because having emanated from an interlocutory order, it is barred by the provisions of section 5  (2) (d) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act [CAP 1 4 1 R.E.  2019].  In  this  regard,  she  argued  that  following  the  dismissal  of  the preliminary objection and the grant of enlargement of time to apply to file an application  for  leave  to  apply  for the  prerogative  orders,  the  decision  in  the respective Ruling is interlocutory and not appealable. To support her proposition,  Ms. Kinyaka  cited  to  us  a  number  of  cases  including, TUNU MWAPACHU AND THREE OTHERS VS THE  NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION  AND  ANOTHER, Civil Appeal No. 155 of 2018 and PARDEEP SINGH HANS VS MEREY ALLY SALEH AND THREE OTHERS, Civil  Application  No.  422/01  of 2018  (both  unreported).  Relying  on  the  cited cases, she urged the Court to apply the principle stated which categorically bars appeals against interlocutory order and implored us to strike out  the incompetent appeal with costs.

Upon being probed by the Court, apart from conceding that, nothing was pending  before  the  High  Court  after  the  disposal  of the  application  seeking extension of time but she insisted, since the respondent was allowed to file an

application for leave to apply for prerogative orders, that sufficed what can be categorized as a matter pending before the High Court.

The  preliminary  objection  was  opposed  by  the  appellants' counsel  who urged the Court to dismiss it on ground of being misconceived. On this, it was Mr. Nyoni's  submission  that,  after  the  determination  of  the  respondent's application  for  enlargement  of  time  to  apply  for  leave  to  seek  prerogative orders, all was done and nothing remained pending before the High Court and as such, the impugned Ruling is not an interlocutory order on the basis of what has been defined by the Court in a number of its decisions. Thus, he cited to us the cases of TANZANIA POSTS COPRORATION VS JEREMIAH MWANDI, Civil Appeal No. 474 of 2020 and THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS VS FARIDI HADI AHMEND AND 36 OTHERS, Criminal Appeal  No.  205  of  2021  (both  unreported). He  as  well  added  that,  the respondent's  subsequent  application  to  seek  leave  to  apply  for  prerogative orders  filed  pursuant  to  the  granted  extension  is  no  longer  before  the  High Court  having  been  struck  out  which  confirms  that,  there  is  nothing  pending before the High Court.

Having considered the submissions of the learned counsel and the record before us, the  issue for our determination  is whether the appeal  before  us is

competent. As earlier stated what is at stake is whether the appeal  before us emanates from an interlocutory order.

What constitutes an interlocutory order is the decision of the Court which does not deal with the finality of the case but settles subordinate issues relating to  the  main  subject  matter  which  may  be  necessary  to  decide  during  the pendency of the case due to time sensitivity of those issues. See: https://lawaic.   info.  Interlocutory  order.

In our jurisdiction, the Court has embraced the principle of the "nature of order test " to  detect  as  to  whether  the  order  is  interlocutory  or  not.  See: MURTAZA  ALLY  MANGUNGU  VS  RETURNING  OFFICER  FOR  KILWA AND TWO OTHERS, Civil  Appeal  No.  80  of  2016, JUNACO (T) LIMITED AND JUSTIN  LAMBERT VS  HAREL  MALLAC TANZANIA  LIMITED, Civil Application No. 473/16 of 2016, THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS, Criminal Appeal No. 205  of  2021 and PETER  NOEL KINGAMKONO VS TROPICAL PESTICIDES, Civil Application  N o.  2  of 2009 (all unreported). In the latter case, the Court stated:

"...it  is therefore apparent that in order to know whether the order is interlocutory or not,  one has to apply " the nature  of order  test". That  is, to  ask  oneself

whether  the judgment  or  order  complained  of finally disposes of the rights of the parties. If the answer  is  in  the  affirmative,  then  it  must  be treated as a final order. However, if  it does not, it is then an interlocutory order."

[Emphasis supplied]

Yet in the case TANZANIA POSTS CORPORATION (supra) which was cited  to  us  by  Mr.  Nyoni,  the  Court  had  to  determine  if  an  application  for revision before it was sought against an interlocutory order having emphasized on the what must be considered in testing 'the nature of order test. Thus, the Court stated:

"That  test  requires  answers  to  more or  less two questions in the context of the matter before us; one, what were the remedies that were sought or the rights that the  respondent  was seeking  to  enforce or obtain from the High Court? And two, were aii such rights or remedies conclusively determined by the High Court or there are certain matters in relation to the same rights that  remained pending  for determination  at  the  High Court?  .... if   the answer  to  question two  is  that everything at the High Court was finally and conclusively wound up, the decree in revision would be a final decree and the bar at  section 5 (2) (d) of  the  AJA will  not  apply.

Conversely,  if the decree in revision by the High Court left  an issue or issues at the same court (the High Court) undetermined, then the decree in revision is an interlocutory order and this Court will not have jurisdiction  to determine the present appeal in  view of section 5 (2) (d) of  the  AJA."

In the  premises, the " nature of order test"\ s squarely applicable in this matter and as such, we are satisfied that, following the grant of the application for enlargement of time to apply leave to seek prerogative orders, the remedy sought  by  the  respondent  was  finally  and  conclusively  determined.  In  this regard, the cases cited to us by the respondent's counsel are not relevant in the present matter considering that, in all those cases, the appeals were dismissed because  the  orders  did  not  finally  and  conclusively  determine  the  matters. Therefore,  in  the  matter  under  scrutiny,  since  the  respondent  was  granted reliefs sought on enlargement of time to apply leave to seek  prerogative  writs, the  matter  was  wound  up  and  as such,  the  respective ruling is  not an interlocutory order at any stretch of imagination. Thus, we agree with Mr. Nyoni that the preliminary objection  is misconceived,  unmerited and  it is accordingly dismissed.

We  now turn  to  the  substantive  appeal.  In  the  course  of  hearing,  the appellants' counsel abandoned the third ground of appeal and we marked it so. Then,  the  learned  counsel  for  either  side  adopted  the  written  submissions containing  arguments  for  and  against the  appeal  in  respect  of the  first  and second  grounds.  A critical  issue  evolving  from  the  appeal  and  the  respective submissions of either side is whether or not the High Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application which is a subject of this appeal.

In  respect of ground  one,  it  was  Mr.  Nyoni's  submission  that the  High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain an application in pursuit of judicial review on matters relating to tax disputes that being the exclusive domain of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) whereby appeals therefrom  lie to the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal)  and  finally,  the  Court  of Appeal  of Tanzania  (the  Court).  He  pointed  out that,  in  terms  of section  7  of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act [CAP 408 R.E.2002], it is the Board which is vested with sole and exclusive jurisdiction  in all  proceedings of a civil  nature in  respect of disputes arising from  revenue laws administered  by the  1 s t  appellant. Thus,  it was  argued  that  the  High  Court  wrongly  entertained  and  determined  the application relating to a tax dispute which is a subject of the present appeal. To bolster his arguments, the learned Principal State Attorney cited to us the cases

Of THE  COMMISSIONER GENERAL (TRA)  VS JSC ATOMREDMETZOLO (ARMZ), Consolidated  Civil  Appeals  No.  78  and  79  of  2018; TANZANIA REVENUE  AUTHORITY VS  TANGO TRANSPORT, Civil  Appeal  No.  84  of 2009 (both unreported).

It was further submitted that, in the event the respondent was aggrieved with the deeds of the 1 s t  appellant in not being responsive on her complaint on the sum of money collected as due tax liability and to attend the respondent's objection,  the  respondent's  remedy  was  to  appeal  to  the  Board  in  terms  of section  52  (6)  of Tax  Administration  Act  [CAP  438  R.E  2019]  (the  TAA)  as amended by the Finance Act in 2020.  It was thus, argued that, in the wake of exclusivity  of jurisdiction  and  the  special  forum  to  determine  tax  disputes  as created by statute, the High Court wrongly assumed jurisdiction to entertain a tax dispute in a judicial review.

In  relation  to  the  second  ground  of complaint,  the  appellants  fault the learned  High Court Judge for not taking cognizance that, since the respondent was seeking the same remedies by way of judicial review and before the Board at the  same time,  this  was forum  shopping  which  amounted  to  an  abuse  of court process. Ultimately, Mr.  Nyoni invited the Court to nullify the proceedings and the respective ruling of the High Court.

On  the  other  hand,  the  respondent  through  Ms.  Kinyaka  opposed  the appeal on ground that, what was before the Court was not a tax dispute but an application seeking enlargement  of  time to apply leave to be granted prerogative  orders. She  submitted  that,  such  remedy  was  invoked  by  the respondent  because  of the  illegalities  committed  by  the  first  appellant  who arbitrarily collected the respondent's money vide a notice of Agency directed to the Bank without any notice of assessment and abdicated from determining the respondent's objection on the alleged tax liability which made it impossible for the appellant to appeal to the Board.

Furthermore,  it  was  contended  that,  since  neither  the  Board  nor  Tax Appeals Tribunal is mandated to grant extension of time within which to apply for leave to seek prerogative orders, the respondent was justified to apply the same before the High Court which enjoys inherent powers to issue prerogative orders. As such, it was thus argued that, in the wake of the oppressive deeds of the 1 s t  appellant, judicial review was the only effective, speedy and adequate means to challenge  her  illegal  conduct. In  this  regard,  it  was  Ms.  Kinyaka's view that the High Court was justified to entertain and grant the respondent's application  so that she could  pursue the  prerogative writs. She distinguished

the cases cited  by Mr.  Nyoni arguing the same to  be  relevant to tax disputes while the matter at hand was dealt with by way of  judicial review.

In her response to the 2n d  ground of appeal, Ms. Kinyaka urged us to find the  same  not  merited.  On  this,  she  argued  that,  the  respondent's  appeals before  the  Board  were  in  relation  to  respondent's grievance  in  a  tax  dispute whereas before the High Court the application was in pursuit of the prerogative orders against illegalities committed  by the  1 s t  appellant. Besides,  she added that the  reliefs  sought in  the  two forums were  not similar which  is obviously reflective  of the  intended  outcomes.  Thus,  she  concluded  that  since  the  two remedies before the said forums that is the Board and the High Court, were not pursued simultaneously, the complaint on forum shopping and the respondent being an abuse of court process against the respondent is unwarranted.

Having carefully considered the submissions of learned counsel, grounds of appeal  and  the  record  before  us,  initially,  it  is  not disputed  that,  the  High Court  of Tanzania  is  clothed  with  jurisdiction  of judicial  review. This  is  in accordance with The Law Reform (Fatal Accidents and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act [CAP 310 R.E 2002].  However, the parties locked horns on the issue as to whether, the High Court  was  clothed with  jurisdiction to entertain and determine  the  respondent's  grievances  by  way  of judicial  review.  While  the

appellants' counsel assert that the respondent's grievance was a tax dispute the respondent contends otherwise having asserted that it is a  matter for judicial review.

At the outset, we borrow a leaf from the Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol 10 whereby jurisdiction is defined in paragraph 314 as follows:

"the authority which a Court has to decide matters that are litigated before it or to take cognizance of matters prescribed in a formal way for its decisions.  The limits of this authority are imposed by statute...under which the court is constituted, and may be extended or restrained by similar means. A  limitation may be either as to the kind and nature of the claim,  or as to the area  which jurisdiction  extended,  or it may partake of both  these characteristics."

The  question  of jurisdiction  was  emphasized  in  the  case  of FANUEL MANTIRI NG'UNDA VS HERMAN MANT1RI NG'UNDA AND 20 OTHERS, Civil Appeal No. 8 of 1995 (unreported) as the Court stated:

' The question of  jurisdiction for any court is basic,  it goes to  the  very root of the authority of the court to adjudicate upon cases of  different nature... The question of  jurisdiction is so fundamental that courts must as a

matter  of practice  on  the  face  of it  be  certain  and assured of their jurisdictional position and the commencement of the  trial. ...it is risky and unsafe for the court to proceed with the trial of  a case on the assumption that the court has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the case."

## [  Emphasis supplied]

From the above quoted excerpts, principally, in adjudication, the question of jurisdiction  is a threshold  question which  must be addressed at the earliest opportunity  in  order  to  save  time  and  costs  and  dire  consequences  of  the proceedings being nullified at the later stage in case the objection is raised and sustained. Therefore, jurisdiction is a creature of statute and not the dislikes or likes of the  parties or  mere compelling  situations as intimated  by the  learned High Court Judge despite a strong presumption that civil courts have jurisdiction to decide all questions of civil nature, the exclusion of jurisdiction of civil courts is  not  to  be  readily  interfered  and  such  exclusion  must  either  be  explicitly expressed  or  clearly  implied. See: Justice  Singh G.P. in a  treatise  titled "Principles of Statutory Interpretation", 8t h  edition, 2001 at page 581.

In view of the aforesaid, the tax disputes resolving mechanism is provided for under  the  TAA  and  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act  vesting  exclusive

jurisdiction to what can safely be referred to as tax courts namely, the Board, Tribunal and the Court of Appeal. See: sections 3, 7, 16(1) and (4) and 25 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act. Therefore,  in terms of the provisions of section  5 1   of TAA,  a tax  payer aggrieved  by a tax decision  may object to the Commissioner  General.  The  respondent  obliged  having  lodged  her  objection faulting the assessment on tax liability. However, at this juncture, it is crucial to point out that, the assertion by the respondent's counsel that her client was not availed  with  tax  assessment  is  not  true.  We  say  so  on  account  of  what  is reflected at page 78 of the record of appeal which shows that the 1 s t  appellant availed  the  respective  notice  of assessment to the  respondent on  24/9/2019 and that is why, she managed to lodge an objection to fault the assessment.

It is the respondent's complaint that the objection was not attended to by the  1 s t   appellant.  According  to  the  provisions  of  section  52  (3)  of the  TAA, where the first appellant does not determine the objection after the expiry of six  months,  the  sum  assessed  is  deemed  to  be  a   final  determination  on  tax payable which as well constitutes an objection decision which is appealable to the Board in terms of section 53 (1) of the TAA which stipulates as follows:

"A person who is aggrieved by an objection decision or other decisions or omission of  the Commissioner General

## under this Part,  may appeal to the Board in accordance with the provisions of  the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act ."

It  is  crystal  clear  from  the  above  statutory  provisions,  an  alternative procedure for determination of tax disputes in relation to omission or any act of the  Commissioner  General  in  the  discharge  of  his  powers  and  functions  is prescribed  under the  law.  It is glaring  on  the  record  that,  the  respondent all along claimed that, the first appellant illegally collected her monies  as settlement of outstanding  liability of corporate tax, capital  gain tax and stamp duty. Apparently, the taxes fall under the provisions of sections 88 (1), (2) and 89 of the Income Tax Act and section 5  (1) (a) and (b) of the Stamp Duty Act [ CAP  189  R.E.2019]  These  are  the  revenue  laws  administered  by  the  1 s t appellant  which  is  prescribed  as  a  central body  for  the  assessment  and collection  of specified  revenue  mandated  to  administer and  enforce the  laws relating to such revenue and the related matters. Therefore, in the wake of the prescribed exclusivity of the forums to deal with tax disputes,  at his juncture, we  deem  it  pertinent  to  restate  what  we  said  in  the  case  of ATTORNEY GENERAL VS LOHAY AKONAAY AND ANOTHER [1995] TLR 80 that:

".. . courts would  not  normally  entertain  a  matter  for which a special forum has been established unless the

## aggrieved  party can satisfy the court that no appropriate remedy is available in the special forum."

In the case at hand, having invoked the remedy of judicial review, prior, the  respondent  did  not  furnish  proof  that  no  appropriate  remedy  could  be obtained from the Board or Tribunal from whose decisions a final appeal lies to the  Court  in  respect  of  claims  arising  from  tax  disputes.  As  the  respondent complaint  hinged  on  the  assessment and  collection  of taxes  arising  from  the revenue laws administered by the 1 s t  appellant, the grievances are justiciable in the Board together with the alleged inaction  by the  1 s t  appellant to determine the respondent's objection against tax assessment. As such, the disputes were outside the competence of the High Court be it in a  suit or by judicial review.

In  the  event the jurisdiction  of the  High  Court  is excluded  expressly,  it seems, what was pleaded before the High Court by the respondent seems to be the respondent's counsel argument that what was before the High Court was a matter for judicial  review and not a tax dispute. Apparently, the learned Judge of the High Court fell in this trap having reasoned that, before it was not a tax dispute  but  rather,  a  matter for judicial  review and  that it was compelling  to issue just and commensurate orders. With respect, we do not agree with both the  respondent's  counsel  and  the  learned  trial  Judge  and  we  shall  give  our

reasons. The Court was confronted with almost an identical scenario in the case of TANZANIA  REVENUE  AUTHORITY  VS  NEW  MUSOMA  TEXTILES LIMITED, Civil  Appeal  No.  93  of 2009  (unreported)  and  had  the occasion to observe the following:

"The second answer provided by Mr.  Magongo  to  the i ssue, is that there was no reference to any tax dispute in the body of  the plaint or  prayers. The answer to that is provided by this Court in KOTRA's case,  where the decision of the Indian case of RAM SINGH vs. GRAN PANCHAYAT (1986) 4 SCC 364 AIR , 1986) SC.  2197 was approved. In the latter case it was held that where  the  civil  Court's jurisdiction  is  excluded, the plaintiff  cannot be allowed to circumvent the bar  by the clever  drafting of  the  plaint"

[Emphasis supplied]

From what can be gathered in the record before us, before the High the respondent's grievances and major cause of action primarily rested against the acts or omissions of the first appellant in the discharge of its functions under the  revenue  laws  namely,  the  ITA  and  the  Stamp  Duty  Act.  However,  the application  was  cleverly  drafted  in  order  to  include  the  claim  for  unfairness, procedural impropriety and illegality on the collection of tax of  TZS.

146,118,017,395.00 as  reflected  in  paragraphs 35  (a),  (b),  (f)  and  (g)  of the respondent's affidavit at the High Court. This was rather a deliberate and risky attempt to bring the matter within the jurisdiction of the High Court in judicial review which cannot be condoned. Thus, it was incumbent on the learned High Court Judge to have seen the tricky circumvention and reject the application at the threshold. See: TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY  VS KOTRA COMPANY LIMITED, Civil Appeal No.  1 2  of 2009 and TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY VS  NEW  MUSOMA TEXTILES  LIMITED (supra).  Moreover, since the jurisdiction of courts is a creature of legislation,  even  if the court is confronted  with  a  compelling  situation  demanding  speedy  resolution,  it  must initially satisfy itself if it is vested  with the jurisdiction  to entertain  the  matter placed before it.

In  view  of  what  we  have  endeavoured  to  discuss,  the  High  Court embarked on a nullity having wrongly assumed jurisdiction which was expressly ousted by the prescribed specific forums established under the Tax Administration Act and the Tax Revenue Appeals Act.  It erroneously crowned itself with jurisdiction that it did not possess in entertaining and determining the respondent's  application  for  extension  of time  to  apply  for  leave  to  pursue prerogative orders.  In the circumstances, the  High Court proceedings and the

resulting ruling  cannot  be  spared.  We  nullify  the  entire  proceedings  and judgment in  Miscellaneous Civil  Application  No.  57  of 2020 and the  incidental orders. Thus, the first ground of appeal  is merited since it disposes the entire appeal,  we  shall  not  embark  on  the  determination  of the  remaining  second ground of appeal. Thus, the appeal is allowed with costs.
