## lUDGMENT  OF THE COURT

29th June  &amp; io" July  ,2018

## MWARllA,  l.A.:

The appellant, School  of st. Jude  Limited has appealed  against  the decision  of the Tax Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal in Tax Appeal No.  29 of 2016  which  arose  from the decision  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Revenue  Board  in Consolidated  Income  Tax  Appeals  No. 124  and 125 of 2015.

Briefly stated, the facts leading to the appeal are as follows: On 23/8/2012, the appellant, which is  registered as a  company limited by guarantee, was issued by the respondent, The Commissioner  General, Tanzania  Revenue  authority (the Commissioner),  income  tax assessment

No. F. 420570023 and F.420570024. Through the two assessments,  the respondent demanded payment of tax in the sum of Tshs. 1,991,672, 238.90 and Tshs. 2,251,655,919.90 derived from the surplus from the appellant's  expenditure for the  years  2009  and  2010  respectively.

The appellant objected  to the assessment  through two letters  dated 30/8/2012 on the ground that, the company  was not doing business or conducting either investment or employment and  did not therefore, have any income  chargeable  to tax.  The respondent  replied  to the appellant's letters  informing  it  that,  after  having  reviewed  its  grounds  of  the objection,  the former was  satisfied  that the latter was  doing business  and therefore, was  liable  to pay  the  assessed tax.

The appellant was further dissatisfied  and on 28/8/2012, it applied for to the Commissioner's  ruling under  5. 131 of the Income  Tax  Act, No. 11  of 2004 (the Act) on contention that the appellant was a charitable organization. In its  ruling  dated  8/2/2013, the respondent  refused  to give the sought ruling.  The appellant was informed that it  did not meet  the requirements  of 5.64(8) of the Act  so as to be recognized  as a charitable organization for  income tax  purposes. According to  the  letter,  the

respondent  arrived  at its  decision  after it had  considered  the objectives  of the respondent  school  as per  its  Memorandum  and  Articles  of  Association. As  a  result, the  appellant was on 2/9/2015,  served with  a  notice of affirmation of  the two assessments.

Aggrieved further by the decision  of the respondent, the appellant instituted the above stated consolidated appeals before the Board. It prayed  for a declaration that the notices  of confirmation of assessments were null and void on the ground that the respondent was wrong in assessing the  appellant  to  corporation  tax  while  it  was  not  doing business. In  the  statement  of  appeal, the  appellant  contended as follows:-

"That  the  Respondent erred  in  assessing the Appel/ant  to  corporation  tax  on  grants,  donations  and sponsorship  income  which  is neither business investment  nor  employment  ncome. i rr

The appeal  was resisted  by  the respondent maintaining its position that the appellant was doing business  and  therefore, it was liable  to pay

the assessed  tax.  In its reply  to the statement of appeal,  the respondent stated  as follows»

"that there was no error in assessing  the Appel/ant as Appel/ant was  doing business  and the issued  assessment was  based  on  income  of  the  appel/ant. "

At the hearing of the appeal before  the Board,  the appellant relied on the evidence of Gemma Sisia  (PWl),  the member of the School's Board  and the founder of the School.  It also  relied on the submission  of its  counsel,  Mr. Nicholous  Duhia.  Her  evidence  was  to the effect that the School provides  free education to students from poor families and in so doing, it  depends  on  donations  and  sponsorships.

It  was  her  evidence  also  that the School  had other minor  sources  of revenue derived from  school fees, visitors' income and miscellaneous incomes. She  admitted  further  that  at the  assessment, the  audited accounts of the  school had a  surplus. She  tendered the  company's Memorandum  and  Articles  of  Association  and  the Certificate  of Incorporation as Exhibit Al, collectively to show that the appellant is a company  limited by  guarantee  not having  a share  capital.

In his submission  before  the Board,  Mr. Duhia  argued  that since  the appellant did not have any income chargeable  to  tax under 5.8 of the Act, it  was not liable to  pay tax as  assessed by the  respondent. According to the learned counsel, grants and sponsorships are exempt from tax under paragraph l(k) of the Second  Schedule  to the Act.  He argued further  that since the appellant provided free education to the student from poor families using donation and sponsorships, from the definition  of "business"  under S.  3  of the Act, the Tribunal erred in deciding  that the appellant  was  conducting  a profitable business.

On its part, the respondent  relied  on  the submission  of its  advocate, Mr. Primi  Manyanga,  learned  counsel.  He submitted before  the Board  that from the statement of appeal,  evidence  and  the submission,  in disputing the assessments,  the  appellant pleaded  exemption to tax liability firstly, on  the  basis  of  the benefits  provided  by  the  Act  to  charitable organizations and secondly, that  it  is  conducting a  non profit  making business.

As for appellant's reliance on being a  charitable organization, Mr. Primi argued that  since  the appellant  did not fulfill the conditions  stated

under S.  64  (8)  (b)  of  the  Act,  it did  not  get  the  ruling  of  the Commissioner  under S.  131 of the Act and therefore that benefit is not available  to it. W'ith regard  to the claim  that the appellant is not liable  to pay  tax because  it is not  doing  a profit making  business,  Mr. Primi  argued that, such  claim was new to the appeals  because  it did not form part of the  pleadings. He  submitted  however, that  from  the  nature of  its activities, the appellant was doing business.  He argued that the 2009 and 2010 financial  statements  show that  the  appellant  had  taxable income  arising  from bank  interest, school  fees  and  surpluses  derived  from donations  and  sponsorships.

In its decisions,  the Board held firstly, that the appellant is not a charitable organization because  it did not satisfy the conditions stated under S.  64  (8)  of  the  Act.  Secondly, after  having considered the provisions  of S. B(l) and (2) of the Act, it held that since  the appellant earned  school  fees  and  because  it also  generated  surplus,  it is not  a nonprofit making  organization and is thus liable  to pay  the assessed  ax.  As t a consequence,  the Board  dismissed  the appeals  with costs.

The appellant was dissatisfied by the decision of the Board  and consequently  appealed  to the Tribunal.  The  Tribunal upheld  the findings of the Board  and as  result, dismissed  the appeal. In its decision, the Tribunal held that  the  appellant is  not a  charitable organization, and according to  its activities,  it  engaged in  a  profit  making business of training students  whose  fees  were  paid by  third parties  through donations and  sponsorships.

Against that decision of the Tribunal, the appellant has  preferred this  appeal  raising  six  grounds  of  appeal  as follows:-

- 1.  That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that the  Appel/ant was  generating profits merely because  he had surpluses  for the years of  income 2009 and 2010 and earned other sources of  income such as  school  fees, visitors'  income  and  miscellaneous income.
- 2.  That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that  the Appel/ant received monetary consideration from sponsors for services offered by him, hence the training activity and the principal occupation of the  Appel/ant  are  carried  on  with  a view  to  deriving  profits.

- 3.  That  the Honourable Tax  Revenue  appeals Tribunal  having acknowledged that the Appel/ant demonstrated that it has provided free education to 96% of  pupils enrolled in the years of  income 2009 and 2010 erred in holding that the Appellant  was engaged in a business activity and is not excluded in  the  definition  of the  word business under section 3 of  the Income Tax  Act CAP. 332 of  the Laws  of Tanzania  Revised  Edition  2006.
- 4.  That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in law by failing  to discern the difference between not doing business and not  being a charitable organization under  section 64(8) of  the  Income Tax  Ac~  ibid.
- 5.  That  the Honourable  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal contradicted  itself  and  erred  in  law  in thet; while  it acknowledged that the  Appellant's financial  statements for the years of income 2009 and 2010 shows, among other things, sponsorship and donations, it upheld the Board's holding that there was  nowhere  in the financial  statements that there were  gifts, bequests  of  inheritance.
- 6.  That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that donations and sponsorship income received  by the  Appellant were  not exempted from income tax under item 1 (k) of  the Income Tax  Ac~ ibid  because

they were received by the appellant  company in respect of its business of  providing  education.

At the hearing of the appeal,  the appellant was represented  by Mr. Nicholous  Duhia  and Mr. Elvaison  Maro,  learned  advocates.  On the other hand, the respondent had the services  of Mr.  Primi Manyanga, learned advocate.  The learned counsel  for the parties had, prior to the hearing, filed their respective  written submissions  as required by Rule 106(1)  and (8) of the Tanzania  Court  of Appeal  Rules, 2009. They thus utilized  the time allowed for oral submission  to clarify the crucial points which were raised  in their written submissions.

Mr. Maro  started by  stating  the  factual  background  giving rise to  the appeal  as has been summarized above in this judgment. He submitted that the parties' dispute is centred on corporation tax assessed  against the appellant for 2009 and 2010 financial years.  He submitted that the appellant is not liable  to pay  tax and  thus challenges  the decision  of the Tribunal  on  the grounds  raised  in the memorandum  of appeal.

Mr.  Duhia took over and proceeded to submit in  support of the grounds of appeal. With regard to the  1s t, 3rd and 4th  grounds, the learned  counsel  challenged  the decision  of the Tribunal contending  that it erred in  upholding the decision of the Board  mainly on the basis that, from the surplus and other incomes,  the appellant was doing business. According to  the  learned counsel, not every surplus on the financial statement  of  a  company  is  chargeable to  tax. He  said that  it  is chargeable only  if  it  is  derived from  either  business, employment or investment, which is not the case with the appellant. He said that the appellant's income is  not  intended for  making  profit and thus  not chargeable  to tax, particularly where the Tribunal had  agreed that the appellant  provides  free  education  to  students  from poor  families.

To bolster his  argument that the appellant  was not doing profitable business,  the learned  counsel  submitted that the amount of school  fees, visitor's  income  and miscellaneous  income  was  insignificant  and  the same was not derived with a view of making profit. He argued  further that the finding of  the Board which was  upheld  by  the Tribunal that the appellant was engaged in  business on  account that  it  had  surplus of  Tshs.

3,006,347,431  and  4,114,741,021  for  the  years  2009  and 2010 respectively, is  erroneous. The appellant challenged also the decision that, from the nature of its activities, its incomes  are  not excluded  in the definition of the word "business" under  S.  3 of the Act and the failure to find that it does not carry out any trade or concern  with the purpose  of generating  profit.

He  contended that  since from  its  Memorandum and Articles of Assodation, the  appellant  is registered  as a company  limited  by guarantee  not  having  a  share capital  and  because it  provides free education  to 96% of  the enrolled  students  using  donation  and sponsorships,  it was an error on the part of the Tribunal to uphold the finding that the appellant was  doing business.  He relied  on the case of Ransom v. Higgs (and Associated Appeals) HL 1974 and  50 TC page 1.

With regard  to the 2nd  ground of appeal,  Mr. Duhia  argued  that the students  did not pay  any  fees  as they were provided  with free education. For this reasons,  he went on argue, both the donors and  the donee  (the appellant) derived no benefit from them (the students) as consideration.

As  for  the  4th ground,  the  learned counsel faulted  the  Tribunal  for upholding the decision  of  the Board  while it  failed to comprehend the difference between doing business  and  being a  charitable organization. He  pointed out that  the appellant did not rely on being a  charitable organization because  it did not possess the ruling of the Commissioner. It rather  relied  on  the  ground  that it  was  not  doing  business.

On  the s" and 6th  grounds, Mr.  Duhia argued that the Tribunal erred  in  failing  to  find  that  sponsorships and  donations  fall  in  the definition of "gift" under S.3  of the Act because they are payments without consideration thus exempted from tax under item 1  (k) of the Second Schedule  to the Act.  He argued  further that the sponsorships  and donations received by the appellant are not connected to any business and  do not  therefore, under  S. 8(2) (f) of the  Act  read  together with item l(k) of  the Second  Schedules  to  the  Act,  exempted  from tax.

In reply, Mr. Primi argued  that the appellant  was  properly assessed to pay  the disputed  tax because  it had the income  which is taxable under S. 8(2) (f) of the Act.  He supported  the decision  of  the Tribunal which upheld the  Board's finding  that  the  appellant was doing  business of

training students whose school  fees are covered by third parties by way of donations, sponsorships, visitors' income, miscellaneous income. He argued  further that the appellant  earns  income  also  from bank  interest  as well as  from  few students whose fees are paid by their  parents. He supported the finding that the appellant  was,  for that reason,  being  paid consideration by third parties on behalf of the parents whose children's fees were covered by donations and sponsorships out  of  which the appellant gained from the excess  amount. Mr.  Primi submitted further that in the circumstances, such income is chargeable  to tax unless  it is excluded  from taxation under  S. 8(3) of  the  Act.

On the contention that the appellant is  registered as a  company limited by  guarantee having no share  capital, Mr. Primi argued  that such registration  status  does  not in itself, preclude  the applicant's  income  from being chargeable to tax. He  stressed that  the  determining  factor  is whether or not the company is doing business. He thus submitted that the case of Ransom v. Higgs (supra) cited by  the appellant's  counsel  is not applicable. Basing  on  his  submission, the  respondent's counsel prayed  to the Court  to dismiss  the appeal  with costs.

We have given due consideration to the submissions  made by the learned  counsel  for the parties.  We  wish to state at the outset that the parties  are not at issue as regards  the position that the appellant is not charitable organization. In his written submission, Mr.  Duhia states as follows  on  that aspect:

"The appel/ant  has  submitted  extensively  n the i r and .]'d grounds that she is not doing business. She  also wishes to submit that she is also not  a  charitable organization  because,  although  she is established  and functioning  solely  for  the  advancement f  education, he o s does  not  possess  he  ruling  of  the  Commissioner  that t to effect." [Emphasis  added],

From the proceedings, it was  after the appellant had failed  to obtain the Commissioner's  ruling that it challenged  the assessment  both in the Board and  the  Tribunal on  the  ground  that it  was  not  doing  business.

Now,  from the grounds  of appeal  and  the submissions  made  by  the learned  counsel  for the parties,  the issue is whether or not the Tribunal

erred in  upholding the  decision of the  Board  to  the  effect  that  the appellant  was liable  to pay  the assessed tax.  As shown above,  the rival arguments centred on whether or not the appellant was doing business. The  submissions  were  extensively  based on  the  interpretation of 5.8(1),(2) and (3) read  together with item1(k) of the Second  Schedule  to the  Act.  Section  8(1) and  (2) (f) of  the  Act  provides  as follows:-

- " 8  (1) A person's income from a business  for  a year of income  is the  person  5  gain or  profits from conducting the  business  for  the  year  of  income.
- 2.  Subject to the  provisions  of  subsection (3), there  shall be included in calculating a person's gains or profit from conducting a business  for a  year of  income, the following amounts  derived  by  the  person  from conducting the  business  during the  year  of  income.

(a)  .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- (c). .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

(e).  .. .

(f) gifts and  other  ex-gratia payments received  by the  person in  respect  of  the  business. "

Sub-section (3) of that section provides for gains or profits which are  exempt  from a person's  income. They  are:-

"(a)  exempt  amounts  and  filial withholding  payments/ and

- (b)  amounts that are  included  in  calculating  the  person's income  from any  employment"

As shown above, under S.  8(1) and (2) (f) of the Act payments derived  from gifts and  ex-gratia payments  are  income,  thus chargeable  to tax. It  was  for  this  reason  that  the  appellant  applied  for  the Commissioner's  ruling under S.  131(1)  of the Act on the ground that the appellant  is a charitable  organization. The  provision  states  as follows:-

" 131(1) The  Commissioner  mey; on  application  in writing by a person  issue to the person, by notice in  writing served on the person, a private ruling setting out the Commissioners  position regarding the application of  this

Act  to  the  person  with  respect  to  an  arrangement proposed or  entered  into by the  person.  "

It was after its application was refused by the Commissioner  that the appellant initiated the  proceedings leading to the  present appeal, contending that it is not doing business  in the meaning  of that word as defined  under  S. 3 of the Act. The main  argument is that the appellant  is not  carrying  out its  business  ith a view  of  deriving profit. w

With respect, we think that this ground is not tenable because  in essence,  it reverts  to  the ground upon  which  the appellant  applied  for  the Commissioner's  ruling.  As shown  above,  under  S. 8(1) and (2) (f) of the Act, the payments received by the appellant are income.  It is for this reason  that, in its  decision,  the  Tribunal  wondered:-

"  If  at  all  the  appellant  ompany  s  not  a  business r c i o doing  business nd  it  is  not  a charitable  rganization a o under  section 64(8) of the Income Tax Act ..  then what  is  it. "

In that  context,  we agree with the Tribunal that  free education provided by the appellant is  paid by third  parties and 50 the surplus shown  in the appellant's  bank  statement is a profit derived  from business. The  same  is therefore chargeable  to  tax.

In the final analysis,  we do not  find merit in the appeal.  The  same is hereby  dismissed  with costs.
