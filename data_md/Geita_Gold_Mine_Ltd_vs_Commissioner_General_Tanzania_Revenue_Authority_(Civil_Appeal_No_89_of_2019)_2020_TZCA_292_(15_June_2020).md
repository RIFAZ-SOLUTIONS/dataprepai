GEITA GOLD MINING LTD...........................................................APPELLANT VERSUS COMMISSIONER GENERAL TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY ... RESPONDENT (Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal at Mwanza )

## fShanawa. 3.1

Dated 10th  day of October, 2012 in

Tax Appeal No. 14 of 2006

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

The  GCL  supplied the said generators but  on installation they collapsed.  As  a  result,  the  holding  company  of  GCL  by  the  name  Rolls Royce  had  to  enter  into  a  hire  Agreement  with  Aggreko  International Project Ltd (AIPL) to install 24 small generators to the appellant's mines as an alternative to the 7 collapsed generators.

The  agreement  between  the  appellant  and  GPPL  permitted  the operator of power house to use fuel efficiently and  fuel  consumption  rate was  imposed.  It was further agreed  that excessive fuel  consumption  was subject to penalty by mines owner, the appellant.

However,  it  was  so  unfortunate  that  the  24  installed  generators consumed  more fuel and exceeded the contractual fuel  limit,  a  fact which triggered the appellant to  invoice the contractor (GCL) for the excess fuel for the period from January,  2001 to September, 2002 to the tune of USD 5,527,553.85 and 20%  Value  Added  Tax  (VAT) amounting to USD 1,105,510.77. During the tax audit, the respondent's officers found the said invoice  in  the  appellant's  books  of accounts  and  as  such,  demanded  the charged VAT to be paid to the respondent. The appellant objected claiming that the  excessive  fuel  supplied  was  not  subjected  to  VAT and  thus,  the appellant was not liable to pay the demanded amount by the respondent.

Aggrieved,  the  appellant  unsuccessfully  challenged  the  decision  of the  respondent to  both  the Tax  Revenue Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  vide VAT Tax Appeal No. 8 of 2004 and the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) vide VAT Appeal  No.  14 of 2006.  Undauntedly, the appellant has preferred  the  current  appeal.  The  Memorandum  of  Appeal  contains  four grounds challenging the decision  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  as follows:-

- 1.  The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law when it held that  Value  Added  Tax  (VAT)  is  payable  on  the  excess  fuel utilized by  M/S  Golden  Construction  Company  to  run  the Geita Gold Mine Power Station.
- 2.  That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in  law and fact when it held that there was a vatable supply of fuel between Geita  Gold  Mine  Limited  and  Golden  Construction  Company operating the Geita Gold Mine Power Station.
- 3.  The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in relying on the  un-issued  invoice to  hold  that VAT is  payable  by  reason only of the existence of the invoice without giving due regard to section 4 and 5 of the VAT Act, 1997.
- 4.  The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in  law in dismissing the appeal and ordering the appellant to pay costs.

The  parties  filed  written  submissions  for  and  against  this  appeal  in compliance with Rule 106 of the Tanzania Court of Appeai Rules 2009 (the Rules).

At the  hearing  of the  appeal,  the  appellant was  represented  by  Mr. Alan  Kileo,  learned  advocate,  assisted  by  Mr.  Wilson  Mukebezi  and  Mr. Norbet Mwaifwani, both learned counsel;  whereas the Respondent had the services of Mr.  Evarist Mashiba, learned Principal State Attorney assisted by Mr.  Hospis  Maswanyia,  Mr.  Harold  Gugami  and  Mr.  Yohana  Ndila,  learned State Attorneys.

Mr.  Kileo adopted  the written  submissions filed  earlier on  as  part of his submission at the hearing. In addition, he submitted that the correctness of the assessment by the respondent is answered on whether or  not  there  was  vatable  supply  between  the  appellant  and  the  GCL. According to him, there was no vatable supply because the fuel in question was  consumed  by  the  appellant.  He,  however,  admitted  that  the  GCL breached  the  terms  of  contract  and  the  appellant  issued  invoice  as  a penalty  for  excess  fuel  utilised.  It  was  his  argument  that,  the  fact  that there  was  an  invoice  indicating  the  VAT should  not  sway the  Court from what  transpired  because  the  end  user  of  the  fuel  is  the  appellant.  He insisted  that  the  appellant  imported  the  fuel  and  consumed  it  and  this amounted  to  self-supply  in  terms  of section  5(1)  (c)  of the  Value  Added Tax Act,  1997 (the VAT Act). He thus argued that any invoice issued by the appellant for fuel indicating VAT as if there was supply was wrong because there was no supply.

He  argued  further  that  section  57  (now  58)  of  the  VAT  Act  which demands VAT to be recoverable whenever there is an invoice showing that VAT,  must  be  read  together  with  section  5  of  the  same  Act  because fundamentally,  VAT  is  a  tax  on  transaction.  As  such,  he  said,  section  57 assumes that there is supply but in the current matter there was no supply and  the  said  section becomes  irrelevant.  According  to  him,  even  the question  as  to  whether  the  invoice  was  cancelled  becomes  irrelevant because there was no supply and hence no transaction.

Upon  being  prompted  by  the  Court  to  state  whether  or  not  the appellant  was  privy  to  the  contract  between  the  GCL  and  Rolls  Royce Company which supplied 24 generators,  his response was in the negative. However,  he  maintained  that  there  was  no  supply  of fuel  so  it  was  not right for the respondent to claim for VAT.  Finally, he urged  us to allow this appeal.

In  reply,  Mr.  Maswanyia,  learned  State Attorney adopted the written submissions and  stated that there is  no doubt that the appellant supplied

fuel  to  GCL,  raised  an  invoice and  proceeded  to  charge VAT as  it can  be seen  at  page  14  of the  record  of appeal.  He  also  said  that,  there  is  no dispute that the invoice subject to this dispute was never cancelled todate. He referred to section 4(1) of the VAT Act and said that, VAT is chargeable to any supply of goods made to a taxable person. He went on stating that, the appellant supplied fuel to the GCL, so the supply is taxable. In addition he said, section  5 of the VAT Act defines taxable supply to mean a supply made by a taxable person in furthering his business. Thus, he said, there is no dispute that the fuel, a taxable supply was supplied to a taxable person by the appellant who is conducting mining business.

He revealed that at the Board and the Tribunal it was proved that the appellant sold fuel to GCL. Therefore, he said, since it was concluded at the Tribunal  that  the  appellant  sold  the  fuel,  this  fact  should  not  be  further entertained  by  the  Court  in  terms  of  section  25(2)  of  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Act, Cap 408 RE 2002.

According to Mr. Maswanyia, the remaining question to be determined is whether the amount raised as back charge is supposed to be collected  by  the  respondent  under  section  57  of the  VAT Act.  He  added that the said  section  57 should  be strictly construed  and the appellant be ordered  to  pay  what  it  charged  as  VAT.  In  support  of  his  position  the

learned counsel cited the case of Resolute  Tanzania Limited v. Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, Civil  Appeal No.  125  of 2017  (unreported)  in  which  the  Court cited  with  approval  the case  of Cape  Brandy Syndicate v.  Inland  Revenue Commissioners (1921)  1   KB 64;  where it was stated that, in taxing one has to look merely at what is clearly said.

Mr.  Maswanyia submitted further that, the invoice has to be taxed  in terms of section 57 of the VAT Act because the supply was supposed to be made to the appellant and not as what the appellant did in this matter.  He therefore prayed that the decisions of lower tribunals be upheld, the appeal be dismissed and the appellant be ordered to pay VAT.

In a very brief rejoinder, Mr. Kileo urged us to construe  the provisions of the VAT Act purposively and harmoniously instead of invoking a  strict  interpretation  rule  as  requested  by  the  respondent's  counsel.  He said,  if sections 4 and  5 of the Act will  so  be construed,  it will  be  realised that there was no taxable supply.  He added that,  both the  Board  and the Tribunal did  not rule out that there was sale of fuel. According to him, the case cited by the respondent is distinguishable because it talked about tax exemptions prescribed  in  the Government  Notices and  this  is  irrelevant in

the  present  matter. He  thus  reiterated  his  prayer  that  this  appeal  be allowed.

We  have  considered  the  submissions  by  the  parties  and  the  entire record  of  appeal. It is quite clear  that  the  appellant  entered in an agreement with GCL under which the latter had to install  7 big generators at the appellant's power  plant. It is undisputed fact that the said generators were  installed  as  per the agreement but they did  not work as expected.  Following that failure,  the GCL had to find an alternative where through  its  holding  company,  Rolls  Royce  Company  had  to  enter  into  an agreement with AIPL to install 24 small generators. The appellant supplied the GCL fuel to run the said generators. Therefore, in this appeal the main contention centres on the fuel supplied  by the appellant to the GCL to run the 24 small generators.

The  appellant  has  presented  four  grounds  of  appeal  as  indicated above. We wish to determine the first and second ground together and the remaining two grounds separately.

In the first and second grounds of appeal the appellant is faulting the Tax Appeals Tribunal for holding that the appellant is required to pay VAT for the fuel supplied to the GCL. The issue calling for our determination  is whether or  not there  was a  vatable supply of fuel  between  the  appellant

and  GCL.  On  the one  hand,  the appellant's  position  is that,  the  supply of fuel  by  the  appellant  is  not  vatable  because  the  fuel  in  question  was consumed by the appellant. On the other hand, the respondent argued that the appellant made a supply which is taxable because she sold fuel to GCL.

We note that the counsel  for the appellant did  not dispute the fact that  the  appellant  issued  an invoice  for  fuel indicating VAT  to  GCL, although  he  said,  it  was  wrong  because  there  was  no  supply  and  the respondent was not supposed to claim VAT.

We further note that the appellant was  not privy to the subsequent agreement between Rolls Royce Company Limited (as a parent Company of GCL)  and  AIPL  which  supplied  24  generators  consuming  excessive  fuel. The appellant demanded  payment for the fuel supplied for the running of the  said  generators  from  Golden  Construction  Limited  and  issued  a  tax invoice of USD  5,  527,553.83  and  charged VAT of 20%  but did  not remit the  same  to  the  respondent.  According  to  the  record,  the  invoice  was debited  and  it appears  in  the  appellant's  audit  report for the year  2002  2003. The invoice which the counsel for the appellant claimed that it was cancelled,  which  was  found  to  be  untrue  both  before  the  Board  and  the Tribunal.

Section 5(1) of the VAT Act defines "taxable supplies" as any supply of goods  or  services  made  by  a  taxable  person  in  the  course  of  or  in furtherance  of his  business.  Therefore,  since there  is  no  dispute  that the appellant supplied fuel  to the GCL to enable the 24 generators to  run for furtherance of business; and since the said generators were installed under an  agreement in  which  the appellant was  not a  party,  we  agree with  the Board  and  the Tribunal  that the  supply  of fuel  made  by the  appellant to GCL  amounted  to  "vatable  supply"  which  was  evidenced  by  the  issued invoice and hence, the appellant is not exempted from paying Tax in terms of section 4(1) of the same Act.

Besides, section 57 of the VAT Act provides that:-

"Any amount shown  on  an  invoice,  a  receipt,  or similar document as VAT chargeable on a supply of goods or services shall be recoverable as  VAT due from  the person issuing the invoice,  regardless as whether:-

- a) The invoice is a  tax invoice as prescribed in the Act;
- b) Tax is chargeable in respect of the supply to which the invoice relates; or
- c)  The  person  issuing  the  invoice  is  a  taxable person."

In  view  of  the  above  provision,  it  is  crystal  clear  that  whenever  an invoice issued as VAT chargeable for a supply of goods or service shall  be recoverable as VAT due from the person  issuing the invoice. Therefore,  in the current matter, since the counsel for the appellant does not dispute the fact that the appellant issued  an  invoice for the fuel  supplied  to  GCL,  we decline the invitation extended to us by Mr.  Kileo that we should  interpret the law purposively and find that the appellant is not required to pay VAT. The language of the law in the above quoted  provision  is  plain,  so we do not see the  need of construing  it purposively.  Having  so stated,  we agree with  the  respondent  that  since  the  appellant  supplied  fuel  to  GCL  and subsequently  demanded  payment  including  VAT  as  per  the  invoice,  she was liable to  remit the same to the  respondent  in  terms of section  57  of the VAT Act. Therefore, the first and second grounds of appeal fail.

In the third ground of appeal, the appellant claimed that the Tribunal did  not give due consideration to provisions of section 4 and  5 of the VAi Act  in reaching  its  decision, instead  it  based  on  the  existence  of  the invoice.  Mr.  Kileo submitted in respect of this ground to the effect that, the fact that there was an  invoice indicating the VAT should  not sway us from the  reality. Fuel is an  input  to  the  appellant  and  thus  imported  and consumed  the  fuel  in  question.  On  other  hand,  the  learned  counsel  was

suggesting  that  the  existence  of the  invoice  should  be  disregarded.  The respondents'  counsel  while  referring  to  section  4(1)  of VAT  Act  he  said that, VAT is chargeable to any supply of goods where it is a taxable supply made to a taxable person.

This  ground  of  appeal  need  not  detain  us  much,  the  issue  as  to whether or not the Tribunal  considered  section  4 and  5 of the VAT Act is easily answered by what is found at page 195 through 196 of the record of appeal.  Both  sections  together  with  section  11  were  considered  by  the Tribunal.  However,  the Tribunal  was of the view that,  the  said  provisions could  not  save  the  appellant from  being  charged  VAT.  The  Tribunal  had this to say:-

"In  our  view,  there is nothing in  the provisions of sections 4,5 and 11  which saves the appellant from being charged VAT on the supply of excess fuel to Golden Construction Limited from January, 2001  to September, 2002 . "

Therefore,  it is  not true that the said  provisions of the  law were not considered by the Tribunal and this ground of appeal also fails.

In the fourth ground of appeal, the appellant is faulting the Tribunal for  dismissing  the  appeal  and  ordering  the  appellant  to  pay  costs.  It  is common  ground  that  in  prosecuting  tax  disputes  parties  do  incur  some

costs which are supposed to be paid by a losing party. We do not see any justifiable  reason of faulting the Tribunal for ordering the appellant to pay costs after having turned a loser.

In the circumstances, we find  no merit in this appeal.  Consequently, we  uphold  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  and  dismiss  this  appeal  in  its entirety with costs.
