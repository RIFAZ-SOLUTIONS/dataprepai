## RULING

S&amp;&amp;Iff*May, 2023

## MAIGE, 3.A:

This application is for extension of time to file a  notice of appeal. It was instituted  after a  similar application  had  been dismissed  by the  High Court  on 15th October, 2021.  This  Court  has  power  to  deal  with  an

application  like this  under  rule  10  of the Tanzania  Court of Appeal  Rules, 2009 (the Rules) read together with rule 45A (1) (a) thereof.

The impugned decision  pertained to the  lawfulness or otherwise of the  service  of  the  respondent  and  it  was  pronounced  on  16th   August, 2013 with the result that, the termination was illegal and the  respondent be  paid TZS 383,364,476.30 and  accruing  interest thereon  at the  rate of 13% as general damages.

Aggrieved,  the  applicants,  having  obtained  an  extension  of  time from  the  High  Court  (Munis,  J), lodged  a notice  of  appeal  on 23r d September, 2016  and applied for a copy  of  the proceedings soon thereafter.  The notice of appeal was however struck out on  23r d  October, 2021  for  failure  to  take  essential  steps  towards  lodging  the  intended appeal. Still  aggrieved, the applicants commenced another application for extension of time to lodge a  notice of appeal which was dismissed  by the High Court and thus the instant application.

In  the  affidavit  in  support  of the  application,  which  was  seriously rebutted  by  the  respondent's  affidavit  in  reply,  the  applicants  associate the  delay  with  bonaftde  prosecution  of  various  proceedings  before  and after  the  striking  out  of the  initial  notice  of  appeal.  To  them,  the  delay was  a  mere  excusable  delay.  In  the  second  place,  the  applicants  have

relied  on  illegality to justify their application.  The illegality  involved  being that, the High Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

At  the  hearing  of the  application,  the  applicants  were  represented by Mr.  Hospis Maswanja,  learned Senior State Attorney and  Ms.  Nalindwa Sekimanga,  learned  State Attorney.  The  respondent on  his  part,  enjoyed the  service  of  Messrs.  Cornelius  Kariwa  and  Mike  Kariwa,  both  learned advocates.

In  her  brief  submissions,  Ms.  Sekimanga  adopted  the  notice  of motion  and  affidavit  and  submitted,  in  respect  to  illegality  that,  as  the dispute  involved  was  purely  a labour  dispute,  the  High  Court  acted without jurisdiction.  The  matter  was  within  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of the defunct Industrial Court of Tanzania ("the ICT") under section 4 of the repealed Industrial Court of Tanzania Act ("the ICTA"), she clarified.

In  reaction,  Mr.  Cornelius  Kariwa  adopted  the  affidavit  in  reply and submitted  that;  the  application  is  an  abuse  of  court  process  in  that; although  the  dispute  has  stayed  for  more  than  23  years,  the  intended appeal  is  yet  to  be  instituted  notwithstanding  expiry  of  more  than  52 months  from  the  time  when  the  High  Court  extended  time  to  lodge  a notice  of  appeal.  Relying  on  the  decision  of  the  Court  striking  out  the

notice of appeal,  he contended that,  the  inaction  amounted to a  serious negligence which cannot be the basis for extension of time.

Having  heard  the  submissions  for  and  against  the  motion,  it  is desirable to determine the  application. The vexing  issue which  I  have to address  is  the  applicants  have  established  good  cause  for  extension  of time.  I  propose to start with the asserted  proposition that, the delay was a  mere excusable technical delay. It is common ground that, in as long as it  was  preceded  by  a  court  order  extending  time,  the  initial  notice  of appeal was filed within time. Therefore, the delay between the lodging of the notice of appeal and striking it out, which was on 23rd  October, 2021, was a mere excusable technical delay.  This is in  line with the principle in Bank  M  (Tanzania)  Limited  v.  Enock  Mwakyusa, Civil  Application No.  520/18  of 2017  (unreported)  to  the  effect that;  a  prosecution  of an incompetent  appeal  when  made  in  good  cause  and  without  negligence, does  in  itself  constitute  good  cause  for  extension  of  time.  See  also Bharya  Engeneering  &amp;  Contracting  Co.  Ltd  vs.  Hamoud  Ahmed Nassor, Civil Application No. 342/01 of 2017 (unreported)

What about the delay subsequent to the striking out of the notice of appeal?  The  justification,  according  to  paragraph  12  of  the  affidavit  is that,  the applicants filed  an application for extension of time to the Court on  27th   November,  2020 which was struck out for being  incompetent.  M r. Kariwa  contends that,  the  act was  by  itself a  signification  of negligence. He is quite right. The applicants have always been duly represented. Their counsel  know for sure that, the original jurisdiction to grant an extension of  time  to  lodge  a  notice  of  appeal  is  vested  in  the  High  Court  or  the tribunal whose decision is the subject of the intended appeal. The filing of the  incompetent  application  to  the  Court  in  my  view,  exhibits  a  serious negligence.  With  respect,  such  negligence  cannot  be  a  justification  for extension of time.

We dealt with a similar issue in case William Shija vs. Fortunatus  Masha, [1997]  T.L.R. 213  where  the  applicant's  appeal which  was  instituted  well  within  time  was  eventually  found  incompetent and therefore, struck out. The cause of action available to the respondent was,  like  the  instant  case,  to  file  an  application  to  the  High  Court  for extension of time to file a notice of appeal. However, the respondent filed an  application  for  extension  of  time  to  institute  an  appeal  to  the  High Court which was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. On application to the Court by way of a second bite, a single justice of the Court extended time on account that the delay arising from the prosecution of the incompetent appeal  was  a  mere  mere  excusable  technical  delay.  On  reference,  the

Court while  noting that,  the  period  used  in  prosecuting  the  incompetent appeal amounted to an excusable technical delay, it was of the view that, the period spent in the prosecution of the incompetent application at  the High Court in so far as it emanated from a clear negligence on the  part of the applicant's counsel did not amount to an excusable technical delay. In particular, it was observed as follows:-

"Applying the principle enunciated in  these cases to  the instant  case; we  are  with  respect, satisfied  that, the negligence  on  the  part  o f  the Counsel  for  the  first respondent in filing  wrong application  which  caused the delay cannot constitute sufficient reason. In our understanding, what featured promptly before the learned  single  judge was  the fact that the wrong application to the High Court was filed immediately after this  Court struck  out the  appeal and that the  delay in filin g  the application which was before him was technical. Had the  learned  single judge taken  into account the fact that  it  was  the Counsels  o f  filing wrong  applications which  caused the  delay,  we  think  he  would  well  have come to a different decision."

Having rejected the  justification for the delay for the period subsequent  to  the  order  striking  out  the  notice  of  appeal,  the  period therefrom  up to the filing of the second application for extension of time

at the High Court remains unaccounted for. So, the application cannot be granted on factual justification for delay.

I  shall  now consider whether the application can  be granted on the ground of illegality. It is now settled that,  illegality can  by itself constitute a  good  cause  for  extension  of  time.  This  is  according  to  the  rule  in Secretary,  Ministry  of  Defence  &amp;  National  Service  v.  Dev  ram Valambhia [1992] T.L.R 18 to the effect that:

"In  our  view, when  the point at issue  is  one  alleging ille g ality o f   the decision being challenged,  the Court has a  duty, even  if   it  means  extending  the  time  for  the purpose, to ascertain the point and if   the alleged illegality be established,  to take appropriate measures to put the matter and the record straight"

It  is  however the  law that,  for an  extension  of time to  be granted on illegality, the illegality must be apparent on the face of the record with sufficient  importance.  This  is  what  we  said  in Lyamuya  Construction Company  Limited  v.  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  Young  Women's Christian  Association  of  Tanzania, Civil  Application  No.  2  of  2010 (unreported) where it was observed:

"Since every party intending to appeal seeks to challenge a decision either on points o f  law or facts, it cannot in my

view,  be said that in  VALAMBIA'S case,  the Court meant to draw  a genera! rule that every applicant who demonstrates  that his intended appeal  raises points  o f law should as o f right, be granted extension o f time if   he applies for one. The  Court there  emphasized that such point o f law,  must be that "of  sufficient im portance" and I  would add that, it must also be apparent on the face o f the record,  such as the question o f  jurisdiction; not one that would be discovered by a long-drawn argument or process."

It  has  also  to  be  noted  that,  extension  is  an  equitable  remedy. Therefore, in deciding whether or not to grant it, the court is expected as well to consider the reason for the delay and the degree of prejudice that the  respondent may suffer if the application  is granted.  See for instance, the case of Henry Muyanga v. Tanzania Communication Company Ltd, BK Civil Application No. 8 of 2014 (unreported), where it was held:

"  The discretion o f the Court to extend time under Rule  10  is  unfettered,  but it has  also  been  held that,  in  considering an application under the rule, the Court  may  take into consideration, such factors as,  the length o f the delay,  the reason for the delay,  the chance o f success o f the intended appeal, and  the  degree  o f  prejudice  that  the

## respondent may  suffer if the application is granted".

I have taken time to consider the element of illegality relied upon by the applicants in  line with the  history and circumstances surrounding the case.  I  am  settled,  in  my mind that; the illegality sought to be corrected in  the  intended  appeal  is  not  of  sufficient  importance. More  so,  I  am settled  that,  the  grant  of the  order  will  lead  to  serious  injustice  on  the part of the respondent. I have two reasons to justify my view. First, the case at the trial court was initiated in 2001 when the defunct ICT was still in  operation.  It was concluded in 2013 when the same had phased out of existence  hardly  ten  years  before.  In  my  view,  as  the  law  and  dispute settlement  machineries  under  which  the jurisdictional  issue  is  based  are no longer in existence,  it is a  matter of common sense that, the intended correction of illegality is not of sufficient importance.

Second and  more  importantly,  this  dispute  has  been  pending  in courts  since  2001.  It  is  now  23  years  old.  It  relates  to  the  fate  of  the service  of  the  respondent.  This  means  that,  throughout  this  time,  the respondent is unemployed. The facts  in the affidavits suggest that,  while the applicants are responsible for this very inordinate delay and sometime by their  negligent  inaction,  the  respondent is  not. Obviously,  therefore,

the grant of the  application  will  occasion  serious  injustice  on  the  part of the respondent  It will not serve any meaningful purpose as well.

In the final  result and for the foregoing reasons, the application fails and it is accordingly dismissed with costs.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 16th  day of May, 2023.
