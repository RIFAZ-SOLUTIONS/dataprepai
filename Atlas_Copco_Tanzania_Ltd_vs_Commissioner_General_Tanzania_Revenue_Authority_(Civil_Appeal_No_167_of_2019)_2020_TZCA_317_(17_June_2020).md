## NPIKA. J.A.:

This  ruling  resolves a threshold  question  raised  by the  Commissioner General,  Tanzania Revenue  Authority  ("the  respondent") by  way  of  a preliminary  objection  against  the  appeal  lodged  by  Atlas  Copco  Tanzania Limited  ("the  appellant")  that  it  has  been  instituted  on  matters  of fact  in contravention  of section  25  (2) of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  Cap.  408 RE 2006 ("the TRAA").

Before determining the above question, it is essential that we provide a  brief  account  of  the  background  as  succinctly  summarized  by  the  Tax

## (Twaib. J. -  Chairman^

dated the 6th  day of August, 2013 in

VAT Tax Appeal No. 21 of 2012

## RULING OF THE COURT

Revenue Appeals Tribunal  ("the Tribunal") whose decision  is the subject of this appeal.

The  appellant  is part  of  Atlas Copco  Group,  a  conglomerate  of multinational  companies  headquartered  in  Sweden.  Apart  from  supplying generators  in  Tanzania  on  its  own,  the  appellant  sold  generators  as  an agent of its sister companies which had no presence in the country. For the latter type of sales, known as "indent sales" the appellant earned commission.

Being  oblivious  that  the  commission  income  attracted  Value  Added Tax ("VAT"), the appellant did not file any VAT returns on indent sales until its  external  auditors,  KPMG,  informed  it  of the  requirement.  By  then,  the appellant had  posted  in  its sales  ledgers commission  income amounting to TZS.  134,413,682,281.00  for  the  years  of  income  2007  and  2008.  The appellant then accounted for VAT on the commission for the years 2007 and 2008 amounting to TZS. 5,692,574,000.00, which was paid through the VAT returns filed in 2009. Certainly, this amount was much smaller than the sum of TZS.  13,413,682,281.00 originally booked in the sales ledgers for the two accounting  years.  The  appellant  had  reduced  the  amount  on  the  ground that there was an overstatement of the commission by TZS.

7,721,108,281.00, which was then corrected through an accounting reversal based on ordinary accounting practices.

The respondent  did not agree  with the appellant's grounds  of objection,  disputing the alleged  overstatement and  reversal.  In  the end,  it issued  a notice  of  additional assessment  No. DNA/02/11/2010  of  28th November,  2011  for  the  sum  of TZS.  2,118,115,834.00  representing  the outstanding VAT plus interest. The appellant unsuccessfully appealed to the Tanzania  Revenue Appeals  Board  ("the  Board").  In  its decision,  the  Board held  as follows: one, that the appellant did  not  provide evidence that the commission  income was  properly  reversed  as the  law  required; two, that there was equally no evidence of overstatement of commission  income or how the  figure  was  arrived  at;  and three, that  there  was  no  convincing evidence that the alleged  reversal  was  a  result of adjustment  intended  to comply  with  the  Atlas  Group's  transfer  pricing  policy.  In  particular,  the Board took the view that the alleged adjustments effected  cumulatively in 2009 were a smokescreen for tax evasion  as the appellant did  not do any adjustments  for  the  accounting  years  2007  and  2008  despite  its  avowed transfer  pricing  policy  requiring  adjustments to  be  made twice  or thrice  a year.

On  appeal,  the Tribunal  substantially  upheld  the  Board's  decision.  It ruled  that  the  alleged  errors  in  the  appellant's books  were  materially doubtful  because  the  appellant  ought  to  have  been  aware  of  its  group's pricing  policy.  If  it  failed  to  comply  with  its  transfer  pricing  policy  at  the material time,  it could  not invoke  it retrospectively to effectively  reduce its tax  liability.  Furthermore,  the Tribunal  was  categorical  that the  appellant's explanations  as  to  what  happened  after  learning  that  the  commissions earned from its sister companies were taxable to VAT were unconvincing.

In this Court, the appellant has filed a Memorandum of Appeal raising four grounds of grievance as follows:

- 1.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law when it held that the  appellant  cannot  invoke  the  group's  transfer  pricing  policy retrospectively;
- 2.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law when it held that the appellant earned the reversed  income;
- 3.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by confirming the decision o f  the Tax Revenue Appeals Board that:
- i. there  was no  evidence showing  that the reversed amounts specifically relate to the commission income  previously earned and booked in the appellant's ledgers for the year o f income under review;
- ii. the commission reversal seems more like a frantic endeavour by  the  appellant  to  reduce  the  huge  and  staggering  tax lia b ility   rather  than  a  genuine  adjustm ent executed  with  a view to rectifying an accounting error; and
- iii. disputed VAT  and  interest were  properly  imposed  and therefore legally due and  payable; and
- 4.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law when it held that the judgment o f the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board was legal and sound and failing  to  uphold the  appeal and award costs  to  the appellant.

As  intimated,  the respondent  contends  by  way  of  a preliminary objection that the appeal  is based  upon  matters of fact in  contravention of section  25  (2)  of the TRAA,  which  enacts the  right of appeal  to this Court only on points of law. The section reads:

"Appeal  to  the  C ourt  o f A ppeal s h a ll  lie   on m atters in vo lvin g  questions o f  la w  o n ly and the provisions o f  the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1979 and the rules made  thereunder  shall  apply  mutatis mutatis to appeals from the decision o f the Tribunal. "[Emphasis added]

At the hearing of the matter, Mr. Wilson K. Mukebezi, learned counsel, teamed up with Mr. Allan N.  Kileo and Mr.  Norbert Mwaifwani,  both learned advocates, to represent the appellant. On the other hand, Ms. Alicia Mbuya,

learned  Principal  State  Attorney,  together  with  Mr.  Primi  Telesphory  and Mses.  Juliana  Ezekiel,  Sarnia  Nyakunga  and  Grace  Letawo,  learned  State Attorneys, appeared for the respondent.

The preliminary objection was canvassed by Mr. Telesphory on behalf of  the  respondent.  His  essential  oral  submission,  based  on  the  written submissions that the respondent had filed in  advance in terms of Rule  106 (2)  of the  Tanzania  Court  of Appeal  Rules,  2009  ("the  Rules"),  was  that none  of  the  four  grounds  of  appeal  presented  by  the  appellant  in  the Memorandum  of  Appeal discloses a question of law, but a factual controversy. He illustrated this stance by examining each ground of appeal.

Beginning  with  the  first  ground, learned  counsel referred  to  the Tribunal's decision  at page 266 of the  record of appeal  by which  it upheld the  Board's  conclusion  at  pages  223  and  224  of  the  record  that  the appellant could  not be allowed to invoke the group's transfer pricing  policy retrospectively to reduce its tax liability.  He was categorical that this ground of appeal contests a factual finding and that it raises no legal or interpretational  question.  Referring  to  the  same  conclusions  of the  Board and the Tribunal, he similarly characterized the second ground of appeal as one fronting  a  factual  controversy.  While  both  the  Board  and  the Tribunal

confirmed that there was no VAT on  reversed  income, they concurred that in  this  case  there  was  no  proof that  there  was  a  reversal  of commission income  and  thus  VAT was  payable.  It  is  contended  that  the  challenge  of that concurrent finding is not an interpretational issue.

Learned  counsel  went on  to  address the third  ground  of appeal.  He similarly argued that the contentions in all three limbs in that ground were based  on  matters of fact.  We  understood  him,  in  effect,  to  be  suggesting that the assailed concurrent factual findings of the  Board  and the Tribunal in the third ground were final and conclusive. These findings are: one, that based  on  evidence  on  record  there  was  no  proof  of  the  reversal  of  the commission  income; two, that there was  no genuine adjustment intended to  rectify  an  accounting  error,  and finally that the  additional  assessment for the sum of TZS. 2,118,115,834.00 as VAT plus interest was justified.

Finally, Mr.  Telesphory  assailed  the  fourth  ground  of  appeal. His argument was that since the  conclusions  of the  Board  and  Tribunal  were made  upon  evidence  (finding  of  facts),  the  complaint  that  the  Tribunal erred "when it held that the judgment" of the Board was "legal and sound" was  a  factual  contention.  In  other  words,  it  was  claimed  that  the  fourth ground  was  no  more than  a  plea  for this  Court to  overturn  the Tribunal's decision  based  on  a  fresh  review  of the  evidence  on  record.  Accordingly, counsel urged  us  to  find  that  the  appeal  contravened  the  mandatory provisions  of  section  25  (2)  of  the  TRAA  and  proceed  to  strike  out  the appeal with costs.

Resisting,  Mr.  Mukebezi contended that the preliminary objection was misconceived.  Initially,  he conceded to the obvious  position that an appeal to the Court from a decision of the Tribunal lay in terms of section 25 (2) of the  TRAA  on  "matters  involving  questions  of  law  only"  subject  to  the provisions of the Appellate Jurisdiction  Act,  Cap.  141  RE  2019  ("the ADA") and  the  Rules.  Having  acknowledged  that  Rule  90  (1)  (a)  of  the  Rules requires the filing  of a  memorandum of appeal  as one of prerequisites for instituting  an  appeal,  he  referred  to  Rule  93(1)  arguing  that  it  does  not state how the grounds in the memorandum of appeal should  be crafted so as to differentiate a point of law from other grounds of appeal.

Learned counsel went on to argue that it was thus impossible for the Court  to determine  whether  a particular ground of objection to an impugned decision was a point of law or not without hearing the parties on the  appeal  or  considering  the  parties'  respective  written  submissions.  We understood  him  as  suggesting  that,  a  preliminary  objection  could  not  be taken on the premises that section 25 (2) of the TRAA was violated where, as in this appeal, no written submissions on the appeal have been filed.

Mr.  Mukebezi  then  referred  to  page  264  of  the  record  where  the Tribunal  upheld  the  appellant's  contention  that  income  reversal  done  in accordance with normal practice was the proper way where, as happened in this case, the supplier was a non-VAT  registered person to whom Regulation  11(1) (c) of the Value Added Tax (General) Regulations, GN  No. 177 of 1998 did not apply. He then wondered why the Tribunal went ahead to  uphold  the  Board's  decision  against the  contention  that the  appellant's reversal of income was based on normal accounting procedures. It was thus his contention that findings such as this one by the Tribunal  raise points of law for the  Court's  attention.  He  concluded  his  argument  by  urging  us to dismiss the preliminary objection.

We  interpose  here  to  remark  that  Mr.  Mukebezi  did  not  specifically examine each  ground  of appeal,  as  did  his  learned  friend,  to  counter the contention that they raise no more than factual disputations.

Rejoining,  Mr.  Telesphory  reiterated  that  the  appeal  lay  on  factual matters.  He  disagreed  that  there  was  no  specific  guidance  on  crafting  a ground of appeal.  It was also his submission that the Court can determine

whether a  particular  ground  of appeal  raises  a  question  of  law  or  not  by testing  or  examining  it  against  the  decision  appealed  against.  He  further contended that the appellant's failure to file written submissions in support of the  appeal  or  in  opposition  to  the  preliminary  objection  cemented  the respondent's position. Lastly, learned counsel maintained his prayer that the appeal be struck out with costs for contravening section 25 (2) of the TRAA.

Having closely examined the record of appeal as well as the memorandum  of  appeal  and  after  full  consideration  of  the  respondent's written  submissions  in  tandem  with  the  parties' oral  arguments,  we  think two  issues arise for our determination.  First,  as  both  parties agree that in terms of section 25 (2) of the TRAA an appeal to this Court from a decision of  the  Tribunal  lies  on  matters  involving  questions  of  law  only,  then,  it behoves  the  Court  to  determine  what  a  question  of  law  is.  Secondly, whether  the  four  grounds  of appeal  raised  in  the  present  appeal  involve questions of law.

As  a  starting  point  on  what  a  question  of  law  entails,  we  wish  to acknowledge that it is  not the first time that the  Court is  confronting  this subject.  For  instance,  in  the case of Insignia  Limited v.  Commissioner General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, Civil  Appeal  No. 14  of  2007

(unreported),  the  Court  accentuated  that  appeals  to  it  from  the  Tribunal should involve questions of law only:

"It is   therefore  evident  that appeals  to  this  Court from  the  Tribunal should involve  only questions o f law. The  appellant  is  not  perm itted  to  re  open factual issues in support o f the appeal.  The appeal should be decided upon a consideration o f the law only and  nothing else. We  are therefore not persuaded  that  the  first  and  fourth  grounds  o f appeal concern points o f law.  The  first and fourth ground o f appeal relate to an evaluation o f the fact in exhibits RE  2; RE  3 and RE 4. For instance, exhibit RE 2 concerns a determination o f whether or not the figures therein are actual  sales or  projections."

In the above case, the Court declined to consider the first and fourth grounds of appeal, which it found to be raising factual issues as opposed to questions  of  law.  Although  the  Court  did  not  define  expressly  what  was meant by a question of law, it considered and applied that phrase as a term of art.

In Meenakshi  Mills,  Madurai  v.  The  Commissioner of Income Tax,  Madras (1957)  AIR 49,  1956  SCR 691,  the  Supreme  Court of India surveyed a  number of Indian  and  foreign  decisions on  what amounts to a

question  of  law,  as  opposed  to  a  matter  of  fact,  within  the  meaning  of section 66 (1) of the Indian Income Tax Act that restricted questions of law only for reference to the High Court for its decision. The Court summed  up the position by stating the following as questions of law:

"(1)  When  the  point  for  determination  is  a  pure question o f  law  such as construction o f  a statute or document o f  title ....

(2)  When  the  point  for  determination  is  a  mixed question  o f law and fact;  while  the  finding  o f the Tribunal on the facts found is final its decision as to the legal effect o f those finding is a question o f  law which can be reviewed  by the court.

(3) A finding on a question o f  fact is open to attack, under section 66(1) as erroneous in law when there is   no evidence to support it or if   it   is   perverse."

The Court also stated that an inference of fact would  remain as such and that its character will not change:

"(4) When the finding is one o f  fact, the fact that  it is  its e lf  in  inference from other  basic facts w ill  not alter its character  as one o f  fact."

Perhaps, more  relevant  for  our  discussion is the  position in the Kenyan  case of Gatirau  Peter  Munya  v.  Dickson  Mwenda  Kithinji  &amp; Three Others [2014]  eKLR where the  Supreme  Court  Kenya  defined  the phrase "matters of law only" under section 85A of the Elections Act for the purpose of electoral dispute resolution.  Before doing so, the Court reviewed the position taken in Meenakshi Mills, Madurai (supra) along with those taken  in  a  myriad  of foreign  decisions in  Canada,  England, the  Philippines, South  Africa,  United  Kingdom  and  United  States.  In  the  end,  the  Court summed up the position as follows:

"[W]e would characterize the three elements o f the phrase "matters o f  law "  as follows:

- a. the technical elem ent: involving the interpretation o f a constitutional or statutory provision;
- b.  th e p ra c tic a l elem ent: involving the application o f the  Constitution and the law to a set o f facts or evidence on record;
- c. the evidentiary elem ent: involving the evaluation o f the conclusions o f  a trial Court on the basis o f  the evidence on record."

Apart from subscribing to the above position, we take inspiration from how the said Court applied the above definition for the purpose of electoral dispute resolution in Kenya.

Thus,  for  the  purpose  of  section  25  (2)  of  the  TRAA,  we  think,  a question of  law means  any  of  the  following: first, an issue on  the interpretation of  a provision of  the  Constitution, a statute, subsidiary legislation or any legal doctrine on tax revenue administration. Secondly, a question on the application by the Tribunal of a provision of the Constitution,  a  statute,  subsidiary  legislation  or  any  legal  doctrine  to  the evidence on  record. Finally, a  question  on  a  conclusion  arrived  at  by the Tribunal  where  there  is  failure  to  evaluate  the  evidence  or  if  there  no evidence  to  support  it  or  that  it  is  so  perverse  or  so illegal that  no reasonable tribunal would arrive at it.

We find  it ineluctable,  at this  point,  to  state that  in  appealing  to the Court  from  a  Tribunal's  decision,  an  intending  appellant  must  craft  his grounds of appeal in line with the terms of section 25 (2) of the TRAA read together with  Rule 93 (1) of the Rules, which  Mr.  Mukebezi referred to.  For ease of reference, we extract Rule 93 (1) as follows:

"93-(l) A  memorandum  o f appeal shall se t forth concisely and  under  d istin ct  heads,  w ithout argum ent o r narrative, the grounds o f objection  to  the  decision  appealed  against, specifying  the  p o in ts  w hich  are  alle g e d   to have been  w rongly decided,  and the nature o f the  order which it is proposed to ask the  Court to make. "[Emphasis added]

As intimated,  Mr.  Mukebezi contended that there was no guidance on how the grounds in the memorandum of appeal should be crafted so as to differentiate a  point of law from other grounds of appeal. With  respect, we do not go along with  him.  We think that Rule 93  (1) of the  Rules provides such  guidance.  In  so  far  as  tax  appeals  to  the  Court  are  concerned,  an intending  appellant  must  specify  the grounds  of  law upon  which  the decision  appealed  against  is  objected  in  terms  of  section  25  (2)  of  the TRAA.  He must specify the points of law which are alleged to have been wrongly  decided.  It  should  be  emphasized  that,  in  an  appeal  from  the Tribunal, matters of law must be evident on the face of the Memorandum of Appeal.

We are also  inclined  to  agree with  Mr.  Telesphory that the  question whether a  particular ground  of appeal  is a  question  of law or  not  may  be

determined  as  a  threshold  issue  by  examining  that  ground  against  the decision  appealed  from. The absence of written  or oral  submissions of the parties on the  merits or otherwise of the appeal  concerned will  not render such issue indeterminable in terms of Rule 106 (10) (b) of the Rules.

Guided by the above principles, we now answer the question whether the four grounds raised in this appeal involve issues of law.

The  first  ground  of  appeal  faults  the  Tribunal  for  holding  that  the appellant could not invoke the group's transfer pricing policy retrospectively. We think that this  ground  is the  principal  complaint in  the  appeal  and  we intend to treat it in  detail.  At the  heart of this ground  is an  attack on  the Tribunal's holding and reasoning, captured at page 266 of the record, thus:

"... the appellant was supposed to have been aware o f  its  Group Pricing Policy and if   it  did not,  or failed to  comply  with  it  at  the  m aterial  time,  it  cannot invoke it retrospectively to effectively reduce its tax lia b ility ."

As rightly submitted by Mr. Telesphory, the above holding was clearly based  on  the  finding  of fact  by  the  Board,  at  pages  223  and  224  of the record, which we take the liberty to reproduce at length thus:

"... whereas the appellant contends that under the Atlas Copco transfer pricing policycom m issions for indent sales among affiliate companies were restricted to a percentage ranging between 1.9%  7%, the appellant did not  produce evidence to show the  actual percentage  which  was  applied on  each transaction,  and as a result,  how much commission was  overpaid  to  the  appellant  and  subsequently recovered by the payer.  The appellant's case is ra th e r vague  lacking  su fficie n t  p a rticu la rs because it  does n o t sp ecify the  transactions, amounts overpaid, percentage used to compute  the com m ission payable and as  we said, the am ount w hich was fin a lly  recovered. It  would  make  a  lo t  o f sense  if  one  wanted  to convince  this  Board  to  come  to  a  positive  finding that indeed commission in  dispute  was not earned by  the  appellant  and  therefore  properly  reversed under the law. Moreover,  we cannot bring ourselves to  believe  that  the  appellant's  officials  were  not aware that such details were important and ought to have been made available to the respondent with a view to putting him  into a proper perspective.  We regret to say that in the absence o f  such evidence it is   h a rd  fo r a n y so b e r p erson  to   b e lie ve   th a t the appellant had been able to dem onstrate to

the respondent  that  indeed  the disputed com m ission incom e was reversed.  We consider that, in the circumstances,  the respondent was right not  to  trust  what  the  appellant  says."  [Emphasis added]

The  Board's  reasoning  and  finding  of fact  go  further,  at  page  224, that:

"We are aware that the exhibit R6 shows that Atlas Copco normally does its transfer  pricing adjustments two to three times per year and that such  transfer adjustments  are  supposed  to  be  done  by  every division controller. Bearing in mind that the appellant did not do any adjustments for the entire period o f the years i.e.,  2007 and 2008 and that as a result, the said adjustments were effected cumulatively in 2009  well after the audit by the  external auditors, we  remain  unconvinced  that  the  alleged  reversal was a  result o f adjustment which  was intended to comply with the pricing policy."

It is evident that the ground under consideration raises no question of construction  or  application  of  a  constitutional  or  statutory  provision.  Nor does it present any element involving misapprehension of the evidence such as failure  to  consider  the  evidence  or  considering  extraneous  matters  not

supported  by  the  evidence  on  record.  It  is  our  respectful  view  that  the contention that the Tribunal erred to hold that the appellant could not apply the group's pricing policy retrospectively to reduce its tax liability is plainly a question of fact. This impugned finding of fact is binding on this Court and cannot be appealed against under section 25 (2) of the TRAA.

Indeed, we took the same view in Bulyanhulu Gold  Mine Limited v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Consolidated Civil  Appeals  No.  89  and  90  of  2015  and Mbeya  Cement  Company Limited v.  Commissioner, Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal No.  160 of 2017 (both  unreported) where we confronted an akin situation. In the former case, we held as follows:

'We agree with the Tribunal that this was a question o f  fact  in terms  o f section  28(2)(b)  o f  the Tax Revenue Appeals Act,  the burden  o f proof was on the appellant to prove that the said equipment was used wholly and exclusively for purposes o f mining operations.  In   the fin d in g   o f the  T ribunal,  the appellant had fa ile d  to discharge the burden. This  being  a  question  o f fa ct  it   ends  there. This is  so, because under section 25(2) o f the Tax Revenue Appeals A ct (CAP 408 RE 2002)

appeals  to  th is  C ourt  lie only  on  m atters in v o lv in g  q u e stio n s o f  law .  So,  we find that the fifth ground is devoid o f substance and we dismiss it  "[Emphasis added]

Similarly, the complaint in the second ground that the Tribunal  " erred in law when it held that the appellant earned the reversed incom e" raises no  interpretational  or  application  of  law  issue.  Nor  does  it  posit  that  the finding  that the  impugned  finding  that the "reversed  income" was  earned was  based  on  no  evidence  or  that  it  was  a  perverse  finding.  We  would reiterate that the Tribunal  upheld the  Board's finding as reproduced above based on the fact that there was no proof of the alleged reversal of earned commission income.

The same fate befalls all the three limbs of the third ground of appeal. The  first  limb,  faulting  the  Tribunal's  finding  that  there  was  no  evidence showing  that  the  reversed  amounts  specifically  relate  to  the  commission income previously earned and booked in the appellant's ledgers for the year of income  under  review,  is  clearly  an  improper  invitation  to  this  Court to review the evidence. The second limb, attacking a factual inference that the commission reversal was not a genuine adjustment executed with a view to rectifying an accounting error, does not raise any valid evidentiary element

of  law.  Equally  objectionable  is  the  last  limb  that  faults  the  Tribunal  for holding that the disputed VAT and interest amounts were properly imposed and therefore legally due and payable. It is not hard to see that at the heart of this contention  is a  plea for reopening the case on the impugned finding that the claimed amount of VAT plus interest was payable. There is no basis for the Court to  re-examine the concurrent factual  finding  of the tribunals below that the appellant produced no evidence to prove the reversal of the commission income earned.

The fourth  ground  of appeal  assails the  conclusions  and  outcome  of the case as determined  by the Tribunal.  Like the  first three  grounds,  it  is quite  problematic.  It  raises  no  questions  on  the  practical  application  of provisions of the law;  nor is it premised on a challenge of evidentiary issues such  as  misapprehension  of the evidence on  record.  We  are  firmly of the view  that  the  disposition  of  the  case  in  favour  of  the  respondent  was predicated  on  findings  which,  apart  from  being  amply  supported  by  the evidence on record, were eminently reasonable, logical and consistent.

We would thus conclude that the present appeal presents no question of law  but  matters of fact that do  not  merit the  attention  of the  Court  in terms of section 25 (2) of the TRAA.

Before we take leave of the matter, we find it in order to take further cue  from Gatirau  Peter  Munya (supra)  on  the  rationale  of  use  and application  special  procedures for  specialized  litigation.  It was  observed  in that case that:

"Election  petitions, not  surprisingly, come  up  for special legislation that  prescribes the procedures and scope  within  which  Courts  o f law have  to  resolve disputes.  Thus, judicial resources should be utilized efficiently,  effectively and prudently.  By lim iting the scope o f appeals to the Court o f  Appeal to matters o f  law  only, Section 85A restricts the number, length and cost o f petitions and,  by so  doing,  meets  the constitutional  command  in  Article  87, for  tim ely resolution o f  electoral disputes."

The  above  observation,  we  think,  equally  applies  to  tax  litigation  in the  country.  The  restriction  of appeals  from  the Tribunal  to  this  Court to questions  of  law  only  is  intended  to  achieve  an  overarching  objective  of timely resolution of  tax disputes. Proper utilization of limited judicial resources  for  resolution  of  only  deserving  appeals  will  lead  to  gains  in efficiency and effectiveness in tax litigation. We can only hope that litigants

will  ensure that only appeals  raising  questions of law will find their way to the Court.

In  the final  analysis,  we  hold that the  Memorandum  of Appeal  raises no  question  of  law  contrary  to  section  25  (2)  of the  TRAA  rendering  the appeal incompetent. In consequence, we strike out the appeal with costs.
