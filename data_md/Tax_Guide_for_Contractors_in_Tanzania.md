## Introduction

Navigating the complex landscape of taxation is essential for contractors operating in Tanzania. This guide aims to demystify the various taxes applicable to contractors, offering a clear and concise explanation of how each tax impacts their operations. Understanding these taxes will not only ensure compliance but also help in effective financial planning and management. Below is an overview of each tax type and its relevance to contractors in Tanzania:

- 1. Corporate Income Tax (CIT): Corporate Income Tax is a tax levied on the profits earned by companies, including construction firms. For contractors, CIT is calculated based on the net income from their construction activities, including contracts and projects. It's crucial for contractors to accurately report their income and expenses to determine the correct CIT liability.
- 2. Value Added Tax (VAT): VAT is a consumption tax imposed on the sale of goods and services. Contractors must charge VAT on their taxable supplies, such as construction services and materials sold to clients. Additionally, contractors can claim input VAT on materials and services purchased for their projects, which can help reduce their overall VAT liability.
- 3. Capital Gains Tax (CGT): CGT is applied to the profit gained from the sale of assets such as land or buildings. Contractors may incur CGT when selling assets used in their business or real estate acquired for development purposes. Proper accounting of acquisition and sale prices is essential to determine the accurate CGT payable.
- 4. Withholding Tax (WHT): Withholding Tax is deducted at source from payments made to suppliers or subcontractors. For contractors, this means that when making payments for services or materials, they must withhold and remit a portion of the payment to the tax authorities. This tax ensures that the service providers meet their tax obligations.
- 5. Pay As You Earn (PAYE): PAYE is a system where employers deduct tax from their employees' salaries and remit it to the tax authorities. Contractors, as employers, are responsible for withholding PAYE from their employees' wages and ensuring timely payment to the authorities. The PAYE system is based on a progressive tax rate structure.
- 6. Skills Development Levy (SDL): SDL is a levy paid by employers to fund skills development programs. Contractors must contribute a percentage of their payroll to the SDL, which is used to support training and skill enhancement initiatives. This levy is crucial for fostering a skilled workforce in the construction sector.
- 7. Customs Duty: Customs Duty is charged on goods imported into Tanzania. Contractors importing construction materials or machinery must pay customs duties based on the value and type of goods. Accurate classification and valuation of imported items are important to ensure correct customs duty payments.
- 8. Excise Duty: Excise Duty is applied to specific goods, including certain constructionrelated products like fuel. While less common, it may affect contractors who use these products in their operations. Understanding the applicable excise duties on purchased goods helps in budgeting and cost management.
- 9. Stamp Duty: Stamp Duty is a tax on legal documents and transactions, including contracts and property transfers. Contractors are required to pay stamp duty on various legal documents related to their construction projects, such as contract agreements and property purchases.

This guide will delve into the legal framework, tax rates, and practical examples for each tax type, providing a comprehensive resource for contractors to effectively manage their tax obligations and ensure compliance with Tanzanian tax laws.

This system ensures that employees meet their tax obligations progressively throughout the year. For contractors in Tanzania, understanding PAYE is crucial for managing payroll and ensuring compliance with tax regulations.

## PAYE Rates:

## 1. Personal Income Tax Rates:

- o Tanzanian Residents:
-  Up to TZS 270,000: 0% (Exempt)
-  TZS 270,001 to TZS 520,000: 9%

-  Scenario: A contractor's employee earns a monthly salary of TZS 1,200,000. The employee is a Tanzanian resident.

## Calculation:

- 1. Determine the Taxable Income: TZS 1,200,000

## 2. Apply the Tax Rates:

-  0 - 270,000 TZS: No tax
-  270,001 - 520,000 TZS: 9% on (520,000 - 270,000) = 9% on 250,000 = TZS 22,500
-  520,001 - 1,010,000 TZS: 20% on (1,010,000 - 520,000) = 20% on 490,000 = TZS 98,000
-  Above 1,010,000 TZS: 30% on (1,200,000 - 1,010,000) = 30% on 190,000 = TZS 57,000

## Total PAYE Tax:

- o TZS 22,500 + TZS 98,000 + TZS 57,000 = TZS 177,500

The contractor's business must withhold TZS 177,500 from the employee's salary and remit it to the TRA.

## Skills and Development Levy (SDL)

## Overview:

The Skills and Development Levy (SDL) is a tax imposed on employers to contribute to the development of skills and training within Tanzania. This levy is applicable to all employers who have ten or more employees and is calculated as a percentage of the payroll cash costs. The SDL helps fund training and development initiatives aimed at enhancing workforce skills and competencies.

## SDL Rates:

## 1. Current SDL Rate:

- o 3.5% of Payroll Cash Costs: As of the latest update, the SDL rate has been reduced to 3.5% of the total payroll cash costs. This rate applies to all employers with ten or more employees.

## 2. Exemptions and Filing Requirements:

- o No SDL Filing Requirement: Employers who are not required to pay SDL are not obligated to file SDL returns. This means if there is no levy payable due to having fewer than ten employees or other reasons, SDL returns are not necessary.

## Legal Reference:

-  Skills and Development Levy Act, 2015, Section 5: This section outlines the SDL obligations for employers, including the rate and the requirement for employers to contribute 3.5% of their payroll cash costs.
- o Section 5: 'Every employer with ten or more employees is required to pay a Skills and Development Levy at a rate of 3.5% of their payroll cash costs. Employers not liable to pay SDL are exempt from filing SDL returns.'

## SDL Calculation Example:

-  Scenario: A contractor employs 12 staff members with a total monthly payroll of TZS 10,000,000.

## Calculation:

- 1. Determine the Payroll Cash Costs: TZS 10,000,000
- 2. Apply the SDL Rate: 3.5% of TZS 10,000,000

## Total SDL:

- o SDL = 3.5% × TZS 10,000,000 = TZS 350,000

The contractor must remit TZS 350,000 as SDL to the relevant authority.

## Special Considerations for Contractors:

-  Threshold for SDL: Contractors with fewer than ten employees are not required to pay SDL or file SDL returns.
-  Compliance: Contractors should ensure that they correctly calculate SDL based on their total payroll cash costs and stay updated with any changes to SDL rates or regulations.

This subchapter provides an overview of SDL applicable to contractors, including the rate, legal references, and calculation examples.

## Customs Duty

## Overview:

Customs duty is a tax levied on goods imported into Tanzania. As a member of the East African Community (EAC), Tanzania applies the East African Customs Union Protocol, which provides a common external tariff (CET) and harmonized customs regulations across member states. This protocol aims to streamline customs procedures and promote trade within the region.

## Customs Duty Rates:

- o Raw Materials, Capital Goods, Agricultural Inputs, Pure-Bred Animals, Medicines: 0%
- o Semi-Finished Goods: 10%
- o Finished Consumer Goods: 25%
- o Specified Products: 35%

## 2. Special Provisions for Contractors:

- o Machinery and Spare Parts for Mining: Import of machinery and spare parts by licensed mining companies, used exclusively for mining activities, is subject to 0% duty.
- Machinery and Inputs for Oil, Gas, or Geothermal Exploration:
- o Machinery and inputs (excluding motor vehicles) imported by licensed companies for direct and exclusive use in oil, gas, or geothermal exploration and development are also subject to 0% duty upon approval by the competent authority.

## 3. Additional Fees:

- o Railways Development Levy: 1.5% of the customs value (excluding goods exempted from import duty, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and specific fuels).
- o Destination Inspection Fee: 0.6% of the Free on Board (FOB) value of the imported goods.

## Legal Reference:

-  East African Customs Union Protocol (2005): This protocol establishes the common external tariff and sets out the rules for customs duties and other traderelated measures.
- o Article 2: 'The common external tariff applicable to imported goods shall be based on the classification and duty rates as specified in the Common External Tariff Schedule.'
-  East African Community Customs Management Act, Section 20: This section provides for the application of customs duties and other related charges.
- o Section 20: 'Import duties shall be levied on goods entering the customs territory of the Community based on the rates specified in the Common External Tariff Schedule.'

## Customs Duty Calculation Example:

-  Scenario: A contractor imports machinery worth USD 100,000 for use in a mining project.

## Calculation:

- 1. Determine the Customs Duty Rate: 0% (as the machinery is used in mining activities)
- 2. Calculate Railways Development Levy: 1.5% of USD 100,000 = USD 1,500
- 3. Calculate Destination Inspection Fee: 0.6% of USD 100,000 = USD 600

## Total Additional Costs:

- o Railways Development Levy = USD 1,500
- o Destination Inspection Fee = USD 600

## Total Additional Costs:

- o USD 2,100

## Special Considerations for Contractors:

-  Exemptions: Contractors importing machinery and spare parts for specific uses, such as mining or oil and gas exploration, should ensure they obtain necessary approvals to benefit from the 0% duty rate.
-  Compliance: Contractors must adhere to the rules of origin and other regulations specified under the East African Customs Union Protocol to benefit from preferential rates or exemptions.

This subchapter outlines the customs duty applicable to contractors, including the general rates, special provisions, and calculation examples.
