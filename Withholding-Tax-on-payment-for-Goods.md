## WITHHOLDING TAX ON PAYMENT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES

## 1.0 Tax Law

This  Practice  Note  is  issued  under  section  9 of  the  Tax  Administration  Act,  Cap  438  as amended from time to time.

## 2.0 Purpose

The Practice Note (PN) is issued for the purpose of  providing  guidance  for  the  general  public and officers of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in  order  to  achieve  consistency  in  the administration of Withholding Tax (WHT) on goods and services as provided for under Section 83 of the Income Tax Act Cap 332. It explains the  legal  and  administrative  aspects  including procedures for treatment and computations of withholding tax on goods and services.

## 3.0 Interpretation

In  this Practice  Note  unless  the  context requires otherwise

- 'Act' means the Income Tax Act Cap 332 and the Tax Administration Act Cap 438.

Definitions  and  expressions  used  in  this  PN have the same meaning as in the Act, unless the context requires otherwise.

## 4.0 The Application   of this Practice Note

## This PN considers:

## Services

- i. Type of services attributable to payment of services fee that are subject to withholding tax under Section 83(1)(c) (ii) of the Income Tax Act.
- ii. Payments to be included in calculating service fees.
- iii. Source rule for payment
- iv. Application to particular type of persons
- v. Calculation of withholding payment amounts.
- vi. Procedures applicable to withholding

## Goods

Withholding tax on payments for goods supplied to corporations and its institutions by any person.

## 5.0 Applicable Concepts

## 5.1 Withholding tax:

Withholding tax is a tax that is required to be withheld  by  the  person  making  'payment'  of certain amounts to another person in respect of goods supplied or services rendered. It is a tax deducted at source because the person making payment has an obligation to withhold.

5.2 Payment for this purpose is defined in the Act as: -

'Payment includes the transfer of assets or money, the transfer or decrease of a liability, the provision of services, the use or availability for use of money or asset and the creation of an asset in another person'

5.3 Withholdee -  A  person  receiving  or entitled to receive a payment  from  which income tax is required to be withheld.

5.4 Withholding Agent - A person required to withhold income tax from a payment made to a withholdee.

5.5 'Professional Service' means services rendered by a person licensed as a practitioner by any recognized professional body and shall  include  other    services    or    activities  of an  independent  business  character  including consultancy,  legal,  architectural,  engineering, supervisory, accounting and auditing, medical, artistic, survey, theatrical performance, sports, exhibition,  private  security  services,    private investigation and consultancies in various disciplines or any entertainment held or given other than those for remuneration under contract of employment.

## 5.6 Corporation'

'corporation'  means  any  company    or  body corporate established,    incorporated  or  registered

under any law  in  force  in the United Republic or  elsewhere,  an  unincorporated  association or other body  of  persons,  a  government, a political subdivision  of  a  government,  a public  authority,  public  institution,  a  public international  organization  and  a  unit  trust  but does not include partnership;

## 6.0    Types of withholding tax

Final  Withholding Taxes are  taxes  in  which the  withholdee  cannot  claim  any  tax  credit when calculating the income tax payable for a year of income.

Non-Final Withholding Taxes : are taxes which the withholdee is entitled for a tax credit being an amount equal to the tax treated as paid for the year of income in which the amount is derived.

Note:

This PN covers only the WHT that relates to Non-Final Withholding Taxes.

## 7.0 Withholding tax obligations

The law requires a resident person who makes payment  to  another  resident  or  non-  resident to  withhold  a  tax  at  the  rates  specified  under paragraph  4(c)  of  the  First  schedule  of  the Income Tax Act.

## 7.1 In case of:-

## (a) Services:

Tax is withheld on payments made in respect of:

- i. Service Fee with a source in URT Paid to a non-resident
- ii. Service fee for provision of professional services paid to a resident person

## (b) Goods

- (1) Any resident corporation which makes payment in respect of goods: supplied by  a  resident  person  in  the  course  of conducting business shall withhold income tax at the rate of 2% as provided for  under  paragraph  4(c)of  the  First Schedule.
- (2) The law shall apply to a resident corporation  whose  budget  is  wholly or substantially financed by the Government budget subvention.

For the purpose of this Practice Note the supply of  water  and  electricity  shall  be  regarded  as goods and therefore not subject to withholding obligation under services.

Note: Water and electricity are nontransferable which is one of the key attributes of any service.

## 7.2 Exempt payment under Sec 83

- 1. Payments  made  by  individuals  unless made in conducting a business;
- 2. Payment that are exempt amount.

## 7.3 Source of Payment

A  service  fee  payment  has  a  source  in  the United Republic where the fees is attributable to rendering service:

- i. In  the  United  Republic,  regardless  of the  place  of  payment. A  payment  has a  source  in  the  United  Republic  no matter  where  the  payment  is  made  if the  service  is  rendered  in  the  United Republic.  Service  is  rendered  in  the United Republic where
- (a) Either the activities are carried out in the United Republic or:
- (b) The  results  of  the  activities  are directed to or utilized or benefitted by resident of the United Republic.
- ii. Where  the  payer  is  the  Government of the United Republic i.e Union Government and Zanzibar  Revolution Government.

## 8.0 Application to particular types of persons

The withholding tax deduction applies to payments made by a resident person including a domestic permanent establishment of a nonresident person to a resident person.

The  tax  withholding  is  non-final  when  the

payment  is  made  to  a  resident  person.  The withholdee shall be entitled to a tax credit in an amount equal to the tax deducted as paid in the year of income.

The  tax  deducted  on  a  payment  made  to  a partnership  shall  be  allocated  to  the  partners, proportionately  to  each  partner's  share  and treated  as  having  paid  by  the  partners  for  the year of income.

## 9.0 Basis for calculation of the withholding payments

## Withholding Tax Base

- I. Tax  shall  be  calculated  on  the  gross amount paid without deduction of expenses or allowances
- II. Withholding Tax shall be computed on the amount exclusive of VAT

## Example 1:

ABC Limited invoice in relation to Consultancy services provided to Dar es Salaam City Council has the following amount:

| DESCRIPTION   | AMOUNT       |
|---------------|--------------|
| Service Fee   | 10,000,000/= |
| VAT           | 1,800,000/=  |
| Total         | 11,800,000/= |

## Therefore:

- I. W/Tax will be charged on Tsh 10,000,000/=
- II. W/Tax is 5%*10, 0000, 000/=

## WHT   =   TSH 500,000/=

## 10.0 Inclusion	of	value	of	benefits	and facilities

Where services  are  provided  and  payments  are made to the withholdee of cash plus provision of benefits  and  facilities,  the  withholding  tax  base shall include the amount paid for the benefits or facilities.  Where  the  benefits  were  not  paid  for, they shall be quantified at a market value at the time of payment. Furthermore, where services are provided and payments are made to the withholdee in form of service fee and reimbursements then the withholding tax base will be the full amount that is service fee plus reimbursement amount.

## Example 2:

FLG  Consultants  were  hired  by  Kinondoni District Council to carry consultancy work. The contract terms involved payment of reimbursement  expenses  which  were  used  for accommodation in a 5 star hotel for 4 staff of FLG for 20 days by the client. The contract price was quoted at Tsh 150,000,000/= plus reimbursements. The  Client  Paid  a  total  of  Tsh  16,000,000/=  as reimbursement  expenses  for  accommodation  of FLG staff.

| DESCRIPTION     | AMOUNT(Tsh)   |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Consultancy Fee | 150,000,000/= |
| Reimbursements  | 16,000,000/=  |
| Total           | 166,000,000/= |

## W/Tax Base

Consultancy fee Reimbursements

150,000,000/=

16,000,000/=

W/Tax Base

166,000,000/=

WHT Computation  =  166,000,000*5%

## WHT  =   8,300,000/=

## 11.0 Withholding Tax Base for Mixed Supplies (Goods &amp; Services)

If  the  invoice  raised  involves  both  supply  of Goods and Services, separation of the amount payable  must  be  made  for  value  for  Goods and Services. However, if the separation is not done then the full amount will be considered as supply for services.

## Example 3:

XYZ was hired to conduct a Survey for Ministry of Education. The contract involved also supply of  Books  and  Stationeries  where  there  was  a need. After completing the work, XYZ raised an invoice with the following details

| DESCRIPTION            | AMOUNT(Tsh)   |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Survey Fee             | 70,000,000/=  |
| Books and Stationeries | 30,000,000/=  |
| VAT                    | 18,000,000/=  |
| Total                  | 118,000,000/= |

- I. W/Tax will be charged as follows:
- (a) W/Tax on Goods (2%*30,000,000/=)
- = 600,000/=
- (b) W/Tax on Service (5%*70,000,000/=)
- = 3,500,000/=

Note: Failure to separate the figures in respect of  the  value  for  goods  and  services  attracts WHT at the rate of 5% on the entire amount (5%*100,000,000) = Tsh 5,000,000/=

## 12.0 Withholding Tax Base for Construction Works

- I. Section  83(3)  of  the  ITA  read  together with  Finance  Act  2016  provides  for apportionment  of  construction  works when determining the base for WHT.
- II. If payment involves Construction Works,  the  payment  subject  to  WHT shall  be  based  on  the  ratio  of  3:2  for Materials and Services respectively.

## Example 4:

Mgeni Contractors were awarded a contract to construct a new office for Ministry of Finance in  Dodoma.  One  of  the  invoice  raised  based on percentage of completion had the following amount:

| DESCRIPTION   | AMOUNT        |
|---------------|---------------|
| Value of work | 600,000,000/= |
| VAT           | 108,000,000/= |
| Total         | 708,000,000/= |

## WHT Computation  based on Construction Work Ratios

| Material          | Service           |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 3                 | 2                 |
| 3/5*600,000,000/= | 2/5*600,000,000/= |
| 360,000,000/=     | 240,000,000/=     |

W/Tax on Goods - (2%*360,000,000/=)

WHT  = 7,200,000/=

W/Tax on Services - (5%*240,000,000/=) WHT = Tsh 12,000,000/=

## 13.0 Procedure Applicable to Withholding Statements  and  payments  of  tax  withheld  or treated as withheld - Sec. 84

## I. Time for Payment

- (a) Tax withheld is payable to the Commissioner  General  within  seven days  after  the  end  of  each  calendar month of deduction.
- (b) Payment of WHT is done electronically through Revenue Gateway System

## II. Filing of   Withholding   tax statements
