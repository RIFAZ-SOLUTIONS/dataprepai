## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

2/h  October &amp;  2n d  November, 2021

## KEREFU, J.A.:

This  appeal arises  from the  decision of  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal) rendered on 28t h  August, 2020 in Tax Appeal  No. 16  of  2019.  In  that  appeal,  the  Tribunal upheld  the decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  dated  8t h February,  2019  in  Tax  Appeal  No.  50  of  2016  which  decided  the matter  in favour  of  the respondent, the Commissioner  General Tanzania Revenue Authority (the TRA).

The  material  background  facts  obtained  from  the  record  of appeal are straight forward and  mostly not in dispute. They go thus: The  appellant  is  a  registered  company  in  Tanzania  whose  primary activities include production and marketing of natural gas produced in Songo  Songo  gas  fields  under  the  Production  Sharing  Agreement (PSA) executed in October, 2001  between the Government of United Republic of Tanzania, the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation  (TPDC)  and  the  appellant.  The  appellant  operates  the gas processing plant owned by Songas Limited under the Operatorship Agreement entered between them.

In  2013,  the  respondent  conducted  tax  audit  on  appellant's accounts which covered the period of 2008 to 2012. In the said audit, the  respondent  raised  a  number  of  queries  including,  over-claimed input tax, unaccounted VAT on imported services under Songo Songo operatorship  services.  Subsequently,  on  19t h   December,  2013,  the respondent  issued  an  assessment  No.  VAT  312  for  additional  VAT payable  of TZS  12,263,250,914.00  comprising  principal  tax  of TZS 6,012,588,034.00 and interest of TZS 6,250,662,880.00.

On 24th  January,  2014, the appellant objected the respondent's assessment for the additional  VAT on  account that (i) she is entitled to claim  half of the input tax that has been assessed as over-claimed by the respondent, (ii) that, on the imported services, the respondent has  assessed  output  tax  without  allowing  corresponding  input  tax deduction and has wrongly imposed interest on the corrected VAT on imported services and (iii) that the materials, equipment and services procured  by  the  appellant  on  behalf  of  Songo  Songo  attracted  no taxable  supply.  As  such,  the  appellant  proposed  to  only  pay  TZS 1,897,409,090.00. The respondent  and the appellant  exchanged several correspondences to iron out their differences on the tax dues where  some  of  the  calculations  were  revised  but  the  respondent maintained  its position on  most of the issues and thus confirmed the audit assessment No. VAT 312 that the total  liability on the appellant was TZS 12,263,250,914.00.

Aggrieved, the appellant unsuccessfully challenged the decision of the  respondent  to  both  the  Board  and  the  Tribunal  as  indicated above.  Undauntedly,  the  appellant  has  preferred  the  current  appeal on the following grounds: -

- (1) That,  the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal grossly erred in law by holding that the arrangement between the appellant and Songas  Limited  under  the  Songas  Operatorship  Service constitutes a supply for I /A  T  purposes;
- (2) That,  the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal grossly erred in law by holding that the respondent was  justified to impose  VAT (output  tax)  without  allowing  corresponding  input  tax  on imported services;
- (3) The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal grossly erred in law by holding that the Board was correct not to take into account the voluntary correction of errors made by the appellant on omission to account VAT  on imported services; and
- (4) That\  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal grossly erred in law and fact  by  holding  that  the  respondent  was justified  to impose interest on the disputed VAT  amounts.

It is noteworthy that counsel for the parties had earlier on filed their  written  submissions  for  and  against  the  appeal  as  required  by Rule  106  (1)  and  (7)  of the  Tanzania  Court  of  Appeal  Rules,  2009 (the Rules).

At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was represented  by Messrs. Rwekamwa  Rweikiza  and  Dr.  Abel  Mwiburi,  both  learned counsels  whereas  the  respondent  had  the  services  of  Ms.  Gloria

Achimpota  and  Mr.  Hospis  Maswanyia,  both  learned  Senior  State Attorneys.

Dr. Mwiburi  who  took  the  floor  to  argue  the  appeal,  fully adopted his written submission earlier on lodged and prayed to argue the first and fourth grounds of appeal separately and then the second and third grounds jointly as they are interrelated.

Starting  with  the  first  ground, Dr. Mwiburi  argued  that  the reimbursement of costs  by  Songas to  the  appellant  in  terms  of the arrangement  between  the  appellant  and  Songas  Limited  under  the Songas  Operatorship Agreement, does not constitute a taxable supply  for  VAT  purposes. He  argued further  that  the supplies, equipment,  parts  and  services  which  were  involved  in  this  appeal were not owned by the appellant but were only procured on behalf of Songas and at Songas' expenses. He insisted that, since the appellant did  not  own  the  said  equipment  and  materials,  she  cannot  be  a supplier  of the  same  thus  there  is  no  supplies  for  VAT  purposes  in terms of section 5 (1) of the Value Added Tax Act,  1997 (the Act).

He argued further that, for there to  be a taxable supply, there must  be value  addition  to  the transaction  between  the  supplier and

the  recipient.  He  said  that,  in  the  matter  at  hand,  the  appellant  (an agent)  purchased  the  equipment  and  materials  from  the  suppliers (third  parties)  and  transferred  the same to  Songas  (the  principal)  at cost. That, there is no markup which the appellant charged to Songas which may  be  calculated to be a value added to trigger the imposition  of VAT,  he  added.  He  thus  invited  the  Court to  find  that the said transaction  was not done  in the course of or in furtherance of the appellant's business. To buttress his position, he referred us to the case of Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales  v.  Customs  and  Excise  Commissioners,  All  ER  1999

Vol. 2 and  a  book  by  G. Morse  and  D.  Williams  Davies,  titled 'Principles o f Tax Law, Sweet  &amp;  Maxwell,  6t h   Edition  2008.  He  then faulted  the  decision  of the Tribunal  which  concluded  that  since  the appellant  is  a  taxable  person,  the  purchase  of the  said  items  by  its own  name  and  transferring  the  same  to  Songas  amounted  to  a taxable supply.

He  further  faulted  the  Tribunal for having  categorized  the appellant as an  independent agent which  he  said  it was  not correct because the appellant only acted as an agent of Songas.

He  further  argued  that, supplies by  a taxable person  are evidenced  by tax  invoices or other documentation  and thus,  since in this  case  none  of  those  documents  existed,  it  was  wrong  for  the Tribunal  to  find  that the  respondent was justified  to  impose VAT on disbursement  received by  the appellant  from Songas  under  the Operatorship  Agreement.  He  thus  faulted  the Tribunal  for  failure  to observe the doctrine of stare decisis as in Geita Gold Mining Ltd v. Commissioner  General Tanzania Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  89  of  2019  (unreported),  where  this  Court  held  the appellant  liable  to  VAT on  the  ground  that  in  their  arrangement the tax  invoice  was  issued  which  is  not  the  case  in  this  appeal. He therefore  invited  us  to  be  guided  by  our  decision  in Geita  Gold Mining Ltd (supra).

As regards the second and third grounds, Dr. Mwiburi admitted  that the  appellant accidentally  omitted  to  account for VAT on imported services but subsequently corrected the errors as required  by  Regulation  4  of  the  Value  Added  Tax  (Correction  of Errors) Regulations, 2000 (the Regulations).  He insisted that, the said corrections were voluntarily  made  by the  appellant.  He thus  blamed the  respondent  for  having  accepted  the  output  VAT entry  made  by

the  appellant  in  the  correction  of  errors  without  considering  the corresponding  input  VAT entry  contrary  to  the  principle  of  InvoiceCredit VAT.  It  was  his  argument that,  if the  respondent  could  have adopted  that  approach,  the  liability  of  the  appellant  for  VAT  on imported services would be zero. He added that the law provides that voluntary  correction of  errors exonerate  the  appellant  from  the liability to penalty and interest.

Upon  being  prompted  by  the  Court  on  whether  the  appellant voluntarily corrected the said errors or the same was corrected after she was contacted  by the  respondent.  Dr.  Mwiburi,  though  admitted that the  appellant  received  the  audit  notice  from  the  respondent on 25t h November, 2011 and made  the said corrections on 29t h November,  2011,  four  days  after  receipt  of  the  said notice, he maintained that the corrections were made voluntarily as the respondent's  audit  notice  does not  amount  to 'physical  contact' envisaged under Regulation 4 (2) of the Regulations.

As for the  fourth  ground,  Dr.  Mwiburi  argued  that  since  there was  no  payable tax  on  the  said  transaction,  it was  improper for the Tribunal to  hold that the  respondent was justified to impose interest

on non-existent tax liability. As such,  he urged  us to allow the appeal with costs.

In  reply,  Ms.  Achimpota,  similarly,  fully  adopted  her  written submission  and  attacked  the  appeal  with  equal  force  by  supporting the  decision rendered by  the  Tribunal. Specifically, on  the  first ground, Ms. Achimpota  argued  that  the  Tribunal  was  correct  in holding  that  the  appellant  was  an  independent  agent  in  supplying goods to Songas and that the arrangement between them  under the Operatorship Agreement constituted a supply for VAT purposes.  She insisted that, since the appellant as an agent of Songas procured the said  equipment  and  materials  in  his  own  name,  the  respondent  is empowered,  under section  59  (3) of the Act,  to treat the same as a supply  made  by  the  appellant.  She  then  argued  that,  the  issue whether the said transaction  was not done  in the furtherance of the appellant's business is a question of fact which,  under section 25 (2) of the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act,  [Cap  408  R.E.  2019]  (the  TRAA), cannot  be  considered  by  this  Court  at  this  stage.  As  such,  she implored  us not to deal with the appellant's argument on that aspect as, she  said,  the  Tribunal had  already  considered  all  the  factual

evidence and established that, the said transfer was  done in furtherance of the appellant's business.

Ms.  Achimpota,  equally distinguished the case  of Institute of Chartered  Accountants  in  England  and  Wales (supra)  relied upon by Dr.  Mwiburi by arguing that, the facts and the circumstances in  that  case  are  not  relevant to  the  current  appeal.  She  also  added that the  provisions  of the  law  relied  upon  by  the  House  of Lords  in that  case  are  different  from  the  provisions  in  the  Act,  hence  not applicable in this appeal.

o As  regards  the  decision  of  this  Court  in Geita  Gold  Mining Ltd (supra),  Ms.  Achimpota challenged the claim  by Dr.  Mwiburi that since there was no issuance of tax invoice in this appeal there was no taxable  supply.  She  referred  us  to  section  29  (1)  of  the  Act  and argued that the fact that the appellant did  not issue a tax invoice to Songas when transferred the said  items  procured  by  her in  her own name,  does  not  mean  that  there  was  no  taxable  supply.  She  thus urged  us to  find  that,  both  the  Board  and  the Tribunal  were correct to  find  that  the  arrangements  between  the  appellant  and  Songas amounted to a taxable supply.

As  regards the second  and third  grounds,  Ms.  Achimpota  cited Regulation  4  (2)  of the  Regulations  and  disputed  the  claim  by  Dr. Mwiburi that the word 'contact 'in the said Regulation means 'physical visitation 'and  presence of a tax officer in the appellant premises for the purpose of checking the appellant's account to be a misconception of  the law. She insisted that the fact that the respondent  contacted  the  appellant  through  a  letter  informing  her that  she  would  be  subjected  to  a  tax  audit  is  sufficient  contact envisaged  under Regulation 4 (2) of the  Regulations.  Ms.  Achimpota argued  further that,  since the said  corrections  were  made  after that notification,  it  was  involuntarily  made,  hence  liable  for  interest  in terms of that Regulation.

She further added that, since the appellant under the provisions of section  16  (6)  of the  Act  (prior to  the  amendment  in  July,  2011) was prohibited to claim input tax on imported services after expiry of one year from the date of relevant fiscal receipt, she cannot claim the same after expiry of that period. To bolster her position, she cited the case  of Mbeya  Cement  Company  Limited  v.  Commissioner General Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil  Case  No.  19 of 2008 (unreported).

As for the fourth  ground  that the  interest  has  been  computed on  a  wrong  principal  amount,  Ms.  Achimpota  contended  that  the same is a  matter of fact which cannot be raised at this stage.  It was her  argument  that,  since  the  said  matter  was  properly  considered and  determined  by  the  Board  and  the  Tribunal,  this  Court  has  no jurisdiction to  reconsider the same on the strength  of section  25  (2) of the TRAA. Finally, she urged us to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  a  brief  rejoinder,  Dr.  Mwiburi  reiterated  what  he  submitted earlier  and  insisted  his  previous  prayer  that  the  appeal  be  allowed with costs.

Having  carefully considered  the  rival  submissions  made  by the counsel  for  the  parties  in  support  and  against  the  appeal,  we  have noted  that  in  her  submission,  Ms.  Achimpota  had  invited  us  not  to consider the issues on whether the transaction  in question was done in the  furtherance  of  the  appellant's business  and  whether  the interest  imposed  against  the  appellant  has  been  computed  on  a wrong  principal  amount,  on  account  that  they  are  raising  purely factual  matters which cannot be entertained by this Court in terms of section 25 (2) of the TRAA. Section 25 (2) of the TRAA provides that:

"Appeals to  the  Court of Appeal shall lie  on matters involving questions of law only and the provisions of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act and the  rules  made  thereunder  shall  apply  mutatis mutandis  to  appeals  from the  decision of  the Tribunal ." [Emphasis added].

The  above  provision  has  been  considered  by  this  Court  in several  occasions and  there  are  numerous decisions of this Court to that effect. See for instance cases of Insignia Limited v. Commissioner  General,  Tanzania Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  14  of  2007  and Shell  Deep  Water  Tanzania  BV  v. Commissioner  General Tanzania Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  123  of 2018  (both  unreported).  Specifically,  in Insignia Limited (supra) when faced with an akin situation, the Court stated that: -

"It is  therefore  evident that appeals to  this  Court from the  Tribunal should involve only questions of law. The  appellant  is  not  permitted  to  reopen factual issues in support of the appeal.  The appeal should be decided upon a consideration of the law only  and  nothing else. We  are therefore not persuaded  that  the  first  and  fourth  grounds  of appeal concern points of law.  The first and fourth

grounds of appeal relate  to  an  evaluation  o f the fact in exhibits RE 2; RE 3 and RE 4.  For instance, exhibit RE 2 concerns a determination of whether or  not  the  figures  therein  are  actual  sales  or projections."

Being  guided  by  the  above  authorities  and  having  considered the  decisions  of the  Board  and  the  Tribunal  on  the  said  issues,  we agree with Ms. Achimpota that the appellant's complaint was sufficiently  dealt  with  by  the  Tribunal  and  the  said  issues  being  on factual  matters,  ought to end  there.  We thus decline the  appellant's invitation  on  those  matters  and  we  will  therefore  determine  the appeal  on the  remaining  issues  under the first ground  together with the second and third grounds of the appeal.

Starting  with the first ground,  we wish  to  note that it is  not in dispute that the appellant is a registered company in Tanzania whose activities  include  production  and  marketing  of  natural  gas,  thus  a taxable  person  and  a  registered  tax  payer.  It is also  on  record  that, under the Operatorship Agreement, the appellant procured equipment and  materials  in  his  own  name  and  then  transferred  the same  to  Songas  who  is  another  taxable person. In return the

appellant received reimbursements on the said transaction. It is again not in  dispute that the appellant failed  to account and  make  returns for VAT on the imported services.

As  regards  the  said  transaction,  it  was  the  argument  of  Dr. Mwiburi  that  the  same  did  not  constitute  a  taxable  supply  for  VAT purposes on account that there was no value added or issuance of a tax  invoice.  On  her  part,  Ms.  Achimpota  maintained  that,  the  said transaction amounted  to a supply which is taxable with VAT. Therefore, the issue for our determination is whether the reimbursement  of  costs by Songas  to the appellant under  the Operatorship Agreement constituted a taxable supply for VAT purposes under the law.

Section 5 (1) (a) - (c) of the Act provides that:  -

" For purpose of  this Act, and  unless otherwise provided  in  this  Act  or  regulations  made  under  it, "taxable supplies" means any supply of goods or services  made  by  a  taxable  person  in  the course of or in furtherance of his business after the start o f  the  V A   T  and includes -

- (a) the making of  gifts or loans of  goods;
- (b) the leasing or letting of  goods on hire;

- (c) the appropriation  of goods for personal use or consumption;  by the  taxable person  or by any other  person."  [Emphasis added].

It  is  clear  from  the  cited  provisions  of the  law  that,  a  taxable supply is the one  which is being made  by  a taxable person. Therefore,  in  the  appeal  at  hand,  since  there  is  no  dispute  that the said transaction was made by the appellant, a taxable person,  in her own  name  in  the  course  of  her  business,  it  constituted  a  taxable supply. With  respect,  it is  not correct,  as argued  by Dr.  Mwiburi that the said transaction  was done  by the appellant (an  agent) on  behalf of Songas  (the  principal).  The  record  bears  out  that  the  same  was done  by  the  appellant  in  her  own  name, hence  an  independent agent.

We are also mindful of the fact that, Dr.  Mwiburi urged us to be guided  by our  previous decision  in Geita  Gold  Mining  Ltd (supra) and find that,  since  in the current transaction there was no issuance of  tax  invoice,  there  was  no  taxable  supply.  Again,  with  profound respect  we  are  unable  to  agree  with  Dr.  Mwiburi  on  this  point.  As correctly argued  by Ms. Achimpota that,  in terms of the provisions of section  29  (1)  of  the  Act,  the  appellant,  as  a  taxable  person,  was

required to issue a tax invoice in  respect of that transaction. The said section provides that:  -

"A taxable person supplying goods or services to another  taxable  person  shall provide  him  with  an  invoice (known  for  the purposes of this Act as a "tax invoice.') containing such  information  about  the  supply,  the  supplier, the recipient and the  VAT as the Minister may by regulations  published  in  the  Gazette  prescribe / ' [Emphasis supplied].

In  view  of the  above  provisions  of the  law,  there  is  no  doubt that the appellant was under legal obligation to issue a tax invoice for the  said  transaction.  As  such,  we  agree  with  the  submission  of Ms. Achimpota that the submission  made by Dr.  Mwiburi  is misconceived as  it  does  not  reflect  the  proper  position  of the  law.  It  is  therefore our considered  view that the appellant cannot  be  allowed  to  benefit from  an  omission  which  is  illegal  in  the first  place.  We  even find  the case  of Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  in  England  and Wales (supra)  relied  upon  by  Dr. Mwiburi  on  this  ground  to  be distinguishable  from  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  this  appeal.  In that case the provisions of the law relied upon by the House of Lords

are  not  applicable  in  this  appeal.  We  thus  find  the  first  ground  of appeal to be devoid of merit.

The second  and  third  grounds of appeal  should  not detain  us, as  both  parties  are  at  per that the  appellant omitted  to  account for VAT on imported services but subsequently, on 29th  November, 2011 she  corrected  the  errors.  This  is  the  fourth  day  after  receipt  of the audit  notice  on 25t h November,  2011  from  the  respondent.  The parties  locked horns  on  whether  the  audit  notice  issued  by  the respondent amounted to a  to/7tec£'envisaged under Regulation 4 (1) and  (2)  of  the  Regulations  and  whether  the  said  corrections  were made 'voluntarily'or 'involuntarily' liable to  interest.  Regulation 4 (1) and (2) provides that: -

- "4  (1)  Errors  voluntarily  disclosed shall  not be  liable  to any penalty or interest provided that  there  is  no evidence  of intention  to  delay accounting  for any payment of  the tax.
- (2) Errors  disclosed  after  the  contact  by  the proper  officer  for  the  purpose  of checking the  records  and  accounts  of  the  business shall  not  be  deemed  to  be  voluntary  and shall be liable to interest. "[Emphasis added].

Upon reading of the above Regulation, we find the argument by Dr. Mwiburi  that  the  word ' contact' used  therein  means  physical visitation  and/or  physical  presence  of a  tax  officer  in  the  appellant's premises  for  purposes  of  checking  the  appellant's  account  to  be unfounded. In our considered view, the notice issued on 25t h November, 2011  by the respondent to the appellant notifying  her on the  tax  audit  to  be  conducted  on  her  business  was  a  sufficient contact  envisaged  under  that  Regulation.  It  therefore  goes  without saying  that,  since  the  appellant  effected  the  said  corrections  after that  notification,  the  same  was  involuntarily  made,  hence  liable  for interest.

In addition, it is also a  requirement of the law under Regulation 6 (1) of the Value Added Tax (Imported Services) Regulations, 2001, that every taxable person  is  required to  lodge tax  returns containing relevant  information  in  relation  to  the  supply  of  goods  or  services supplied  to  him  as  well  as  recording  of  the  imported  services  as output tax  and  then  claim  the  same  as  input tax.  We  clearly  stated this  position  in  our  previous decision  in Mbeya Cement Company Limited (supra).

It  is  therefore  our  settled  position  that  the  Tribunal  at  page 1140  of  the  record  of  appeal  properly  determined  this  matter  by making  reference  to  our  decision  in Mbeya  Cement  Company (supra)  and  correctly  affirmed  the  decision  of  the  Board.  We  thus also find the second and the third grounds of appeal devoid of merit.

In  totality,  and  for  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  do  not find  any cogent  reasons to  disturb  the  concurrent findings  and  the  decisions of the Board and the Tribunal.

In  the  event,  we  uphold  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  and dismiss the appeal with costs.
