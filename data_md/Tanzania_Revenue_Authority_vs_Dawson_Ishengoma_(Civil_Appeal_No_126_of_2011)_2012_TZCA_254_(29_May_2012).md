## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

captain of the boat.  Following the notice of seizure the respondent claimed for  release  of the  boat  and  the  Commissioner  of Customs  and  Sales Tax decided to  release the  boat but the respondent was required to  pay Tshs. 40,000/=  fine  before the  boat was  released as  it  had  carried  contraband goods.  The  letter  to  the  respondent  requiring  him  to  pay  the  fine  was written  on  13.06.  1991.  The  fine  was  paid  on  13.08.1991.  Immediately after the payment of the fine, the Regional Customs and Sales Tax Officer (RCSTO)  of  Mara  region  instructed  the  Mara  Regional  Police  Commander (vide  letter  dated 14.08.1991-  exhibit  Dl)  to  release  the  boat  to  the respondent. The respondent was advised,  pursuant to a copy of the  letter written to the Regional Police Commander to collect his vessel.

The facts narrated above were established.

The parties were not in agreement as to what transpired between the time the  letter  exhibit  Dl  was  written  and  December  1999  when  the  suit was filed.  The  respondent claimed  to  have  gone  for  collection  of  his  boat  but found  it in  a  dilapidated  state whereupon  he was  promised  by the  RCSTO that  he  would  undertake  to  repair  it.  Apart  from  his  own  oral  allegation

there was no other evidence to establish  his assertion that the RCSTO had undertaken to  repair the  boat. The appellant Authority through  its witness one  Leornard  Shija  who  was working  in  the  RCSTO's office  in  Musoma  at the  time  of  the  seizure  of  the  boat  refuted  the  respondent's  claim.  The witness was categorical that there was no promise of the repair of the boat by their office.  Moreover,  in  its Written Statement of Defense the appellant had denied in toto the respondent's assertion that its officer had undertaken  to  repair  the  boat.  The  respondent was  put to  strict  proof of the allegation.

The  respondent's  claim  which  was  allowed  by  the  High  Court  was  for  a total  of  shs. 116,  7000,  000/=  comprising  of  loss  of  the  marine  vessel, special damages for loss of business and general damages.

In their  Written Statement  of  Defense  the  appellants  had raised  two preliminary points of objection  in addition to disputing the claim generally. One  point  referred  to  the  liability  of  the  appellant  in  the  matter  for  the reason  that  it  was  not  yet  in  existence  at  the  time  the  cause  of  action arose. The second point of objection was based on period of limitation.

The appellants preferred the following six grounds of appeal:

- 1.  That the trial  judge misinterpreted the provisions of  section 32 of the  Tanzania  Revenue Authority Act,  Cap  399  R.  E  2002  and erroneously  held  that  the  appellant  was  answerable  to  the respondent's claim.
- 2.  That the trial court erred in law in entertaining and hearing the suit while the same was time barred.
- 3.  That the  trial court erred in law and in fact in  holding that the appellant's  agents  continued  to  detain  the  respondent's  marine vessel unlawfully  after the respondent  had  paid the necessary fine.
- 4.  That the  trial court erred in law and in  fact in  holding that the respondent's marine  vessel was lost while in  the custody of the appellant's agents.
- 5.  That  the trial court  erred  in  law  and  in fact  in awarding compensation  of Tshs.  14,000,000/,  for loss of the  respondents marine vessel, special damages of Tshs.  92,700,000/= for loss of business income and  general damages shs. 10,000,000/= while no loss was sustained  by the respondent.
- 6.  That the trial court erred in law and in fact in awarding interests and costs.

Mr.  Salvatory  Switi,  learned  counsel  appeared  on  behalf  of the  appellant Authority.  The  respondent  was  represented  by  Mr.  Vedastus  Laurean, learned  advocate.  Both  sides  had  filed  elaborate written  submissions  prior to the hearing of the appeal for which we are thankful.

We will  begin  our consideration  of this appeal  on  whether or  not the  suit before the High Court was time barred.

There is no doubt that the suit was founded on tort. The respondent vainly tried  to  show  that  the  suit  was  founded  on  contract  but  the  respondent failed  totally  to  establish  that there  was  a  contractual  undertaking  by the RCSTO to repair the boat, allegedly after the  respondent had found  it in a dilapidated state. There was no written undertaking to repair the vessel nor was the officer said to  have undertaken to repair it called to establish that there  was  that  contractual  undertaking.  The  learned  trial  judge  did  not state that he found the suit to have been founded on contract and reading from  his  judgment  one  gets  the  impression  that  he  agreed  with  the

appellant's  counsel  that the  suit was  founded  on  tort. He  stated  thus  at page 123 of the record:

"In the second ground in the preliminary objection ; Mr. Sweet stated in defendant's written submission that the cause of  action accrued on 14.08.1991,  when the marine vessel was found damaged. He opined that under item 6 , Part 1  of  the Law of  Limitation Act, Cap 89 (R. E.2002) the period of  limitation founded on tort was three years. But what  were  clarified in  the  first and second issues show  that  the plaintiff was moved to institute this suit from December, 1996,  when he determined that the material vessel was missing. And the cause of action  accrued  from  that juncture. Therefore  in  December,  1999 when the plaintiff  instituted this suit, it was not time barred."

The period of limitation for suits founded on tort is three years as per item 6  of  Part  1   of the  First Schedule  of the  Law  of  Limitation  Act.  The  crucial question then is when did the cause of action arise?

It is on  record that the marine police were asked to release the vessel soon after the respondent had  paid the fine. The letter which was written to the

marine police is dated 14.08.1991. The letter was copied to the respondent.  We  agree  with  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  and indeed  we  are  settled  in  our  minds  that  14.08.1991  is  the  date  that  the cause of action  arose.  From  14.08.1991  till  30.12.1999  when  the suit was filed  is over 8 years.  The suit was  late by  5 years. The  learned trial judge ought  to  have  dismissed  the  suit  for  having  been  filed  outside  the  time limited by law.

Even  if,  for  the  sake  of academic  argument we  were  to  assume  that the suit was founded on contract, the cause of action would have accrued from the  date that the  RCSTO  undertook to  repair the vessel  which  must  have been in August 1991 when the respondent found his vessel to have been in a  dilapidated  state.  Counting  from  August  1991  to  December  1999  is  a period of over 8 years.  Suits founded on contract have to be filed within  6 years as per item 7 of the Schedule to the Law of Limitation Act.

We observe also that the respondent very conveniently did not mention the exact date in  December  1996 when  he allegedly found  his vessel  missing. There  is  no gainsaying  that  in  computing  period  of  limitation  every single

day counts.  If it were to  be assumed for example that the cause of action of the  suit  founded  on  tort  arose  in  December  1996  then  the  period  of limitation  would  end  in December  1999.  The  plaint  here  was  filed  on 30.12.1999.  What would  give the court justification  to assume that it was filed  within  time  in  the  absence of a  specific  mention  of the  date that the cause  of  action  arose?  Mr.  Laurean  suggested  that  it  was  the  appellant Authority who ought to have known the exact date that the cause of action arose because it wanted to apply the law of limitation. With due respect to the learned counsel, this suggestion is highly misguided. It was  the plaintiff, now  respondent  who  had  to  show  that  his  suit  was  in  time. Mentioning  of  the  specific  date  when  the  cause  of  action  arose  in  the circumstances of this case was vital.

In  the  circumstances  we  find  ground  two  on  period  of  limitation  to  have been  preferred  with  good  cause.  The  learned  trial  judge  ought  to  have dismissed  the  suit  on  account  of  being  barred  by  period  of  limitation. Having  so  found  we  consider  it futile  to  embark  on  the  other  grounds of appeal.

The appeal is in the event allowed with costs.
