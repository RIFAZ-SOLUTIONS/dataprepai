Tanzania is a country in East Africa bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east. The United Republic of Tanzania came into being in 1964 following the union of the Republic of Tanganyika (formed in 1961) and Zanzibar. Its official languages are Kiswahili and English. Dodoma is the national capital of Tanzania, and the Tanzanian shilling (TZS) is the official currency.

Tanzania's major export industries include agriculture, mining, and tourism. A significant proportion of the population are employed in agriculture. Longer term, Tanzania's significant gas reserves are expected to generate significant export earnings. Other significant sectors of the economy include construction, financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, and utilities.

Certain payments to non-residents are subject to tax at the relevant non-resident WHT rates ( see the Withholding taxes section for the relevant rates ).

Corporate - Other taxes Last reviewed - 02 January 2024

## Value-added tax (VAT)

VAT is chargeable on all taxable goods and services supplied in, or imported into, the United Republic of Tanzania. The standard rate of VAT is 18% in Mainland Tanzania and 15% in Tanzania Zanzibar, except for banking, postal, and telecommunication services where an 18% rate is applicable. Additionally, the export of goods and certain services is eligible for zero rating. Generally, businesses with or expecting to generate an annual taxable turnover of more than TZS 200 million in Mainland Tanzania and TZS 100 million in Tanzania Zanzibar must register for VAT. The Commissioner has the discretion to register (as intending traders) investors whose projects have not commenced production of taxable supplies but wish to be VAT-registered in order to reclaim the tax they incur on start-up costs. A business that only makes exempt supplies is unable to register for VAT and, consequently, unable to recover the VAT incurred on inputs.

Registered businesses must submit VAT returns, and pay any tax due, monthly.

There is also mandatory registration for professional service providers (e.g. lawyers and accountants) and government entities/institutions carrying out economic activities. A non- resident who carries on an economic activity in Mainland Tanzania without a fixed place (e.g. non-resident suppliers of B2C electronic services) and makes taxable supplies in excess of the VAT registration threshold (no threshold for non-resident suppliers of B2C electronic services) is required to appoint a VAT representative unless it is impractical to do so due to business circumstances, in which case the non-resident would be required to apply for a simplified registration in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations.

For imported goods, VAT is payable at the time of importation together with any customs and excise duties. VAT payable with respect to specific capital goods (as defined) may be deferred, subject to certain procedures being followed. However, VAT deferment on imported capital goods will cease to apply from 30 June 2026.

For imported services, VAT is accounted for by registered businesses through a 'reversecharge' mechanism, and such accounting is only relevant where a taxpayer has exempt supplies of 10% or more of the total supplies.

Depending on the industry, there are a number of exempt supplies. These include (this list is not exhaustive):

-  Agricultural implements, agricultural inputs, livestock, basic agricultural products and food for human consumption; implements for fisheries; bee-keeping implements; dairy equipment; and medicine or pharmaceutical products.
-  Import of food, clothing, and shoes donated to non-profit organisations for free distribution to orphanages or schools for children with special needs in Mainland Tanzania.
-  Goods imported by non-profit organisations for the provision of emergency and disaster relief (conditional).
-  Goods imported by religious organisations for the provision of health, education, water, and religious services (conditional).
-  Educational services provided by a relevant approved educational institution; education materials.
-  Import of laboratory equipment and reagents by a registered educational institution to be used solely for educational purposes.
-  Goods eligible for relief under the East African Customs Management Act (where imported by a registered and licensed explorer or prospector for exclusive use in oil, gas, or mineral exploration or prospecting activities).
-  Various goods imported by a natural gas distributor (including compressed natural gas [CNG] plants equipment, natural gas pipes, transportation and distribution pipes, CNG storage cascades, CNG special transportation vehicles, natural gas metering equipment, CNG refuelling of filling, gas receiving units, flare gas system, condensate tanks and leading facility, system piping and pipe rack, and condensate stabiliser).
-  Healthcare, medicine, or pharmaceuticals products, including food supplements or vitamins supplied to the government; articles designed for people with special needs; funeral services.
-  Fire-fighting vehicles imported by the government and fire-fighting equipment.
-  Sale of vacant land.
-  Lease, license, hire, or other form of supply, to the extent that it is a supply of the right to occupy and reside in residential premises.
-  Water (except bottled or canned water or similarly presented water).
-  Supply of solar panels, modules, solar charger controllers, solar inverters, vacuum tube solar collectors, and solar batteries.
-  Unprocessed edible vegetables.
-  Insurance for health, life, aircraft, workers compensation, crop agriculture, and livestock farming.

-  Import of artificial grass of HS Codes 5703.21.00, 5703.29.00, 5703.31.00, and 5703.39.00 for football pitches located in a City or Municipal Council approved by the National Sports Council of Tanzania.

The VAT Act contains restrictions on claiming of input tax. For example, one cannot claim VAT incurred on entertainment; membership to sporting, social, or recreational clubs or associations; and spare parts and repair or maintenance costs in respect of passenger vehicles.

The input tax claim time limit is six months. However, this time limit starts to run by reference to the date of the fiscal receipt.

Input tax incurred on goods in the six months prior to VAT registration can be claimed no later than in the third VAT return submitted following registration.

A company with taxable supplies of more than 90% of total supplies is entitled to full input tax credit while a company with taxable supplies less than 10% of total supplies is not entitled to claim any input tax incurred.

A company with taxable supplies between 10% and 90% of total supplies is entitled to partial input tax recovery. Two methods of apportionment, namely the average method and direct attribution method, can be used. Imported services are not taken into account as supplies when determining the allowance of input tax for partial exemption purposes.

Businesses entitled to VAT refunds can claim any remaining credit six months after the refund first became due, subject to all intervening returns being rendered. Any claim for a VAT refund must be supported by an auditor's certificate of genuineness. Businesses in a consistent refund position (e.g. exporters) may apply for approval to lodge their refund claims monthly.

The VAT Act includes specific requirements to be met by a fiscal receipt to facilitate a refund claim. This includes claims made by diplomats and international organisations. A fiscal receipt is defined to include receipt issued by a fiscal device, by the Government Electronic Payment Gateway, and any other electronic system approved by the Commissioner General.

VAT in Tanzania Zanzibar is administered under a separate but similar legislation.

## Digital service tax

A non-resident involved in digital transactions (i.e. providing electronic services) is required to account for tax of 2% on the turnover (excluding VAT). The Regulations (Income Tax

(Registration of Non-Resident Electronic Service Suppliers) Regulations, 2022) provide for procedures to be followed by non-residents providing electronic services, covering matters including scope of services, registration (online), filing simplified income tax returns (online), and payment requirements.

## Customs duty

Tanzania is a member of the East African Community, which became a Customs Union on 1 January 2005 on the implementation of the East African Customs Union Protocol. This protocol provides for a common external tariff (CET), elimination of internal tariffs, rules of origin, anti-dumping measures, a common customs law, and common export promotion schemes.

Generally, the import duty rates applicable under the CET are as follows:

| Category                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   Rate (%) |

## Corporate - Branch income

Last reviewed - 02 January 2024

The income tax liability of a person with a PE in Tanzania is calculated as if the person and the PE are independent but as if the PE is resident in Tanzania. The income of the PE is taxed at the normal income tax rate for entities, namely 30% on net income or 5% of turnover for technical and management service providers to mining, oil, and gas entities.

The PE is also subject to a tax on 'repatriated income', which applies at a rate of 10% (the same rate as a company would withhold on dividends).

In certain circumstances, business activities of the head office may be attributed to the branch. Arrangements between a PE and head office generally are not recognised, other than the transfer of an asset or liability between the two. Amounts derived (or payments received) and expenditures incurred (or payments made) that relate to assets held by, or liabilities owed by, the business of the PE are attributed to the PE.

## Corporate - Income determination

## Last reviewed - 02 January 2024

Subject to any provision to the contrary in the Income Tax Act, income is to be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Local GAAP is in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Corporations must apply an accrual basis of accounting.

## Inventory valuation

Trading stock is valued at the end of the year at the lower of cost and market value. No explicit method is stated for determining inventory cost, and, so far, for tax purposes, such cost will match the cost determined in accordance with GAAP. Special rules apply for the valuation of long-term work in progress.

## Capital gains

There is no separate capital gains tax in Tanzania. Instead, income tax is charged on the taxable profit arising on a gain arising from the realisation of an 'investment asset' (a term that [subject to certain exceptions] includes shares, interests in land and buildings, and a beneficial interest in a trust). The gain is determined as the difference between costs incurred and sale proceeds.

## Dividend income

Dividend income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.

Dividend payments are taxed by way of WHT, and this is a final tax. The normal rate of WHT on dividends is 10%.

Where a dividend is paid by a resident corporation to another resident corporation holding 25% or more of shares and voting rights in the corporation paying the dividend, the WHT rate is 5%.

Dividends paid by a company listed on the DSE are subject to 5% WHT (regardless of whether they are paid to a resident or non-resident).

## Interest income

Interest income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.

The term 'interest' is defined as payment for the use of money and includes payment made or accrued under a debt obligation that is not a repayment of capital, as well as any gain realised by way of a discount, premium, swap payment, or similar payment.

Interest payments made by residents are taxed by way of WHT at 10%.

## Royalty income

Royalty income will be included in calculation of taxable income unless it is exempt or a final withholding payment.

Royalty payments made by residents are taxed by way of WHT at 15% (regardless of whether it is paid to a resident or non-resident), except for payment relating to the use of cinematography film, videotape, sound recording, or any other like medium, where the applicable rate is 10%. WHT on royalty payments to a non-resident is a final tax.

The term 'royalty' means any payment made by the lessee under a lease of an intangible asset and includes payments for:

- i. the use of, or the right to use, a copyright, patent, design, model, plan, secret formula or process, or trademark
- ii. the supply of know-how, including information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment or experience
- iii. the use of, or right to use, a cinematography film, videotape, sound recording, or any other like medium
- iv. the use of, or right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment
- v. the supply of assistance ancillary to a matter referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iv), or
- vi. a total or partial forbearance with respect to a matter referred to in paragraphs (i) to (v), but excludes a natural resource payment.

## Foreign income

A resident person's foreign-source income or loss (from employment, business, and investment) is calculated as that person's worldwide income or loss less any income sourced in Tanzania and plus any loss sourced in Tanzania.

A resident person may claim a foreign tax credit on any foreign tax paid by the person on foreign income. However, such credit should not exceed the Tanzanian tax rate applicable to that income. Any unrelieved amount of foreign tax credit may be carried forward (subject to 'change in control' provisions as detailed in the Group taxation section ). An election may be made to relinquish foreign tax credit and claim a deduction for the amount of foreign income tax.

There are no provisions for the deferral of the taxation of foreign income.

## Corporate - Deductions

## Last reviewed - 02 January 2024

In calculating taxable profit, deductions are allowed for revenue expenditures incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income, with some statutory exceptions. For capital expenditures, there are specific tax depreciation allowances.

There are special rules with regard to the valuation of trading stock and long-term contracts and in relation to the treatment of instalment sales and finance leases.

There is ring-fencing of mining or petroleum operations by reference to the relevant mining or petroleum licence area.

## Depreciation

The categories of depreciable assets and their tax depreciation rates are set out in the table below.

Expenditures on plant and machinery are generally written off on a reducing-balance basis at rates of 37.5%, 25%, or 12.5%, depending on the category of the asset. Certain plant and machinery for manufacturing, fish farming, and tourist hotels benefit from a 50% allowance in the first year, with the normal rates applying to the remaining balance in subsequent years. There is an immediate write-off of expenditures on plant and machinery used in agriculture.

Expenditures on buildings qualify for a depreciation allowance of 5% per year on a straightline basis. For intangible assets, the write-off is over the useful life of the asset.

Apart from the immediate write-off of plant and machinery, agricultural businesses also benefit from the immediate write-off of agricultural improvement expenditures (including the costs of clearing land, excavating irrigation channels, and planting perennial crops or tree bearing crops). Buildings, structures, dams, water reservoirs, fences, and similar works of a permanent nature used in agriculture, livestock, or fish farming are written off on a straightline basis over five years.

Expenditure incurred in respect of mineral or petroleum operations during a year of income qualifies for depreciation allowance at the rate of 20% per year on a straight-line basis.

## Interest in land

Interest in land does not qualify for depreciation allowance as it is excluded from the definition of 'depreciable asset'.

## Goodwill

Goodwill does not qualify for depreciation allowance as it is excluded from the definition of 'depreciable asset'.

## Start-up expenses

Start-up expenses are deductible to the extent that they meet the general deduction criteria (i.e. they are revenue in nature and were incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income). The definition of 'business' includes a prospective business.

## Interest expenses

Interest expenses are deductible on an accrual basis, subject to thin capitalisation rules as detailed in the Group taxation section .

## Bad debt

- i. to charitable institutions (approved by the Commissioner to operate as such) and social development projects
- ii. under Section 12 of the Education Fund Act 2001
- iii. to local government authorities under statutory obligations to support community developments projects
- iv. to the AIDS Trust Fund established under the Tanzania Commission for AIDS Act, or

The deduction available under item (v) shall cease to have effect when the Minister may determine by notice in the Gazette.

## Fines and penalties

Fines and similar penalties payable to a government or a political subdivision of any country for the breach of any law or subsidiary legislation are not deductible.

## Taxes

Taxes payable under the Income Tax Act 2004 are not deductible.

## WHT paid by withholder

WHT paid by withholder is not deductible.

## Net operating losses

There is no limit on the carryforward period for tax losses. However, there is ring-fencing of tax losses as follows:

-  Losses from agricultural business can only be offset against profits derived from agricultural business.
-  Losses from one mining licence area can only be offset against profits from the same mining licence area.
-  Losses from one petroleum licence area can only be offset against profits from the same petroleum licence area.
-  Foreign-source losses can only be offset against foreign-source profits.
-  Losses on investments can only be offset against investment income.
-  Foreign-source losses on investments can only be offset against foreign-source investment income.
-  Losses incurred on speculative transactions can only be offset against income derived from speculative transactions.

In addition, the following restrictions apply to tax losses:

-  The deductibility of the losses carried forward is restricted (for holders of a petroleum exploration licence, mineral licence, and licence in respect of midstream and downstream activities) such that only 70% of the taxable profits of the company can be sheltered by losses brought forward (with any excess losses carried forward to future years).
-  For businesses other than agriculture, health, and education services, the deductibility of the losses carried forward is restricted after a period of four years of continuous losses such that only 70% of the taxable profits of the company in the fifth year can be sheltered by losses brought forward (with any excess losses carried forward to future years).

In certain circumstances, tax losses may be forfeited on a change in the underlying control of an entity.

Tax losses can be carried back only in long-term contracts in a case where a contract is completed and a person has unrelieved losses for that period or a previous period that is attributable to the long-term contract. These losses can then be carried back to a previous year of income and treated as unrelieved loss for that year.

## Payments to foreign affiliates

Payments to foreign affiliates are deductible to the extent they are wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of the company's income. The deduction is subject to transfer pricing provisions as detailed in the Group taxation section .

## Controlled foreign trusts and corporations

There are provisions that relate to the treatment of unallocated income of controlled foreign trusts and corporations.

## Change in control provisions

The change in control provisions are triggered at the moment the underlying ownership of an entity changes by more than 50% as compared to any time during the previous three years. Where there is such a change, the consequences are that:

-  the accounting period of the entity is split at the point of such a change, so that the parts of the year of income before and after the change are treated as separate years of income, and
-  there is deemed realisation of assets and liabilities at market values.

In certain cases, such a change can also result in the forfeiture of unutilised tax losses and tax credits.

The Commissioner has to be notified immediately before and after the change in control has occurred.

## Exemptions

The change of control provisions do not apply in the following circumstances:

-  Where the change is a result of allotment of new membership interest of the entity.
-  A sole result of transfer of membership interest of a resident entity to another resident person.

## Other anti-avoidance provisions

Other anti-avoidance provisions exist to address the following:

## Tanzania

## Corporate - Tax administration Last reviewed - 02 January 2024

## Taxable period

While the year of income for tax purposes is the calendar year, an entity may apply to use its own accounting period rather than the calendar year.

## Tax returns

A statement of estimated tax payable, which contains an estimate of the chargeable income and the tax payable thereon, is due for submission within three months from the beginning of the accounting period. A final tax return must be furnished within six months from the end of the accounting period.

WHT returns must be submitted every month. The due date for filing the WHT return is the seventh day of the month following the month to which the tax relates.

## Payment of tax

Instalment tax is payable in four equal instalments not later than three months, six months, nine months, and 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period. Final tax is payable on the date on which the final return is due for submission, namely six months after the end of the accounting period.

WHT is due seven days after the month of deduction.

## Penalties

A late filing penalty applies monthly at an amount equal to the higher of (i) TZS 225,000 or (ii) 2.5% applied to unpaid tax. If estimated tax is significantly underestimated, a penalty may also apply.

Interest on late payment is charged at the Bank of Tanzania discount rate.

## Tax audit process

The normal practice is for the TRA to carry out a review every two or three years.

Time limit set for the Commissioner to determine an objection

If no determination is issued within six months of an objection, the underlying tax assessment or decision will be treated as final/confirmed, and the taxpayer can appeal to the Board.

## A 100% tax deposit on objection to tax decisions where there is a flight risk

The Commissioner can demand a deposit of 100% of assessed tax where the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that the objector intends to permanently leave the country.

## Statute of limitations

There is a five-year time limit for the TRA to adjust an income tax return filed by a taxpayer. The five years runs from the due date of filing the final tax return.

## Topics of focus for tax authorities

Currently, the topics of particular focus for the TRA include transfer pricing, VAT compliance, WHT on payments to both residents and non-residents, compliance on payroll taxes, and post clearance audits for importers and exporters of goods. They generally perform various reconciliations, including (i) sales declared in the VAT returns compared to the revenue in the financial statements and the sales per the EFDMS, (ii) payroll costs per financial statements compared to the amount of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) remitted, (iii) expected WHT per the expenses in the financial statements compared to the amount remitted, and (iv) deposits in the bank account compared to the sales per the financial statements.

## Functional currency

Taxable income and deductible expenditure is quantified in Tanzanian shillings. Upon request by the taxpayer, the Commissioner has the power, by notice in writing, to permit quantification in a foreign currency convertible to Tanzanian shillings.
