## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

28th  June, &amp; 5t h  July,2021

## KWARIKO, J.A.:

This  is  a second  appeal.  The  appellant  was  aggrieved  by  the decision  of the  High  Court of Tanzania  sitting  at  Mwanza  (Gwae,  J.)  in (DC)  Civil  Appeal  No.  54  of 2014  which  overturned  the  decision  of the District Court of Musoma at Musoma (the trial court). The appellant was awarded by  the trial court  general damages  to  the  tune  of  TZS 15,000,000.00 with interest of 7%  per  annum from the date of judgment  to  full satisfaction. The  award  was  for  loss  of  business following  delay  in  re-registration  of  his  motor  vehicle  Minibus  Toyota

Hiace No. TZK 9565 (henceforth "the vehicle") which was doing business of carrying passengers between Musoma and Bisumwa area within Mara Region.

The  facts  of the  case  which  unfolded  before  the  trial  court were not  complicated;  they  are  as  follows.  The  appellant  claimed  that  the respondent delayed to register the vehicle into a new single identification  number for motor vehicles as required under Regulation  18 (1)  of the  Road  Traffic  (Motor  Vehicles  Registration)  Regulations,  G.N. No.  177  of 2001  which  came  into  operation  on  17t h   August,  2001  (the Regulations).

The appellant further claimed that he responded to the requirement  by  paying  the  necessary  fees  of  TZS  52,000.00  for  re­ registration  and  was  asked  to  collect  the  new  number  for  the  vehicle within 14  days  but  that  was  not  the  case. He  claimed  that  the respondent  negligently  failed  to  give  him  new  registration  number  for more than three years despite several reminders.

Basing  on  the  alleged  negligence  and  unreasonable  delay,  the appellant sued the respondent  for  judgment  and decree for TZS 53,487,850.00 for loss of profits and general damages to be assessed by

the court,  interest at 35% from the date of filling the suit to the date of judgment,  court's  interest  at  9%  from  the  date  of  judgment  till  full payment and costs of the suit.

For her part, the respondent  admitted  to have received the appellant's  application  but  delayed  to  complete  the  process  since  she discovered  that  the  chassis  number  of the  vehicle  which  the  appellant filled  in  the  form  was  different  from  the  actual  one.  The  respondent further claimed that Regulation 41 (3) of the Regulations did not provide specific time within which to register motor vehicles. She thus permitted the  appellant to  use the vehicle  until the  new  number was  issued.  The appellant thus  claimed  that the  decision  of the  respondent to  park the vehicle was at his own peril.

Aggrieved by the trial court's decision, the respondent appealed to the  High  Court  where  she  raised  a  total  of  seven  grounds.  The  first ground of appeal was as follows:

"That the trial court erred in iaw in entertaining and trying the suit whilst it had no original  jurisdiction."

After  hearing  the  parties,  the  first  appellate  court  allowed  the appeal on the basis of the first ground. That court found that according to  section  7  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act  [CAP 408  R.E.  2002]  (the

TRAA),  ordinary  courts  like  the  trial  court  are  ousted  from  hearing matters emanating  from  revenue  laws.  It therefore found  that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

The  appellant  was  not  amused  with  that  decision;  hence  he  has filed  this  appeal  through  Juristic  Law  Chambers  of  Mwanza  raising  two grounds of appeal:

- 1.  That , ■ the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  erred  in  law  in holding that the trial court had no  jurisdiction to entertain the matter before it
- 2. That,  the Learned High Court Judge erred in law and fact for not holding that the exhibits tendered before the trial court were not endorsed by the trial court and the parties.

During  the  hearing  of the  appeal,  Messrs.  Elias  Hezron  and  Deus Richard,  learned  advocates  joined  forces  to  represent  the  appellant, whilst  the respondent  was  represented by Mr. Hospis Maswanyia, learned  Senior  State  Attorney,  who was  assisted  by  Mr.  Leyan  Sabore, learned State Attorney.

When  he  was  called upon  to  argue  the  appeal, Mr. Richard abandoned  the  second  ground  and  argued  the  first  ground  only.  He submitted that the  High  Court erred  to  hold  that the trial  court  had  no jurisdiction to try the suit.  He explained that section 7 of the TRAA, gives the  Board  powers  to  determine  tax  related  matters  but  the  provision should  be  read  together  with  section  12  thereof  which  specifies  the types of disputes to be determined by the Board. He argued that its only matters  relating  to  tax  assessment which  are triable  by the  Board  thus the  High  Court was wrong to  relate the  appellant's claims for damages in  that  respect.  That  according  to  paragraphs  7,  8  and  9  of the  plaint, the  appellant's  claim  was for  compensation  for  loss  of  business  arising out of the respondent's delay to register his vehicle.  Likewise,  paragraph 5  of the written  statement of defence  by the  respondent admitted  that the appellant had paid the required tax hence there was no any issue in relation  to  tax  assessment.  Additionally,  the  learned  counsel  submitted that  the  issues  framed  at  the  trial  court  did  not  reflect  anything  in relation to tax or its assessment.

It was Mr.  Richard's further argument that the decision of Mohsin Somji v. Commissioner for Customs and Excise &amp; Commissioner for  Tax  Investigations [2004]  TLR  66  which  the  High  Court  relied upon in  interpreting section 7 of the TRAA was distinguishable from the instant case  because the appellant did  not dispute any tax assessment.

He  contended  that the  Board  as  a  special  forum  for  tax  matters  could not deal with  issues of assessment of damages but the ordinary courts. To  support  his  contention,  the  learned  counsel  made  reference  to  the Court's decision in Attorney General v. Lohay Akonaay and Joseph Lohay [1995] TLR 80.  He finally urged  us to quash the decision  of the High Court and allow the appeal with costs.

Upon being probed by the Court,  Mr.  Richard submitted that in the case  of Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  v.  New  Musoma  Textiles Limited, Civil  Appeal  No.  93  of  2009  (unreported),  equally  the  Court interpreted section 7  A of the TRAA and the facts were different from the instant case.

In  response to the foregoing, Mr.  Maswanyia argued that section 7 of the  TRAA gives  the  Board  powers  to  entertain  civil  disputes  arising out of the  respondent's  administration  of  revenue  laws.  Therefore,  the appellant's claim at page 76 of the record of appeal relates to compensation  for damages for  loss  of business  is  a  civil  matter,  which was  justiciable  by  the  Board.  To  fortify  this  contention,  the  learned counsel  cited  the  Court's  decision  in Khofu  Mlewa v.  Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  229  of 2019 (unreported). The learned counsel argued further that section  7A of the

TRAA at that time provided the procedure in respect of tax assessment. He also referred to section 14 which lists matters that can be entertained by the Board directly without consideration of section  12 and that the appellant's complaint fell on that category.  Mr.  Maswanyia cited the  case  of New  Musoma  Textiles  Limited (supra)  to  support  his stance. With these submissions, the learned counsel  urged  us to dismiss the appeal with costs.

Responding to the Court's probing,  Mr.  Maswanyia submitted that section  6  of  the  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  Act  Cap.  399  (the  "TRA Act")  provides for appeals to the  Board  where any  person  is aggrieved by  the  decision  of the  Commissioner-General  in  relation  to  any  act  or omission  in  the  course  of the  discharge  of  his function  conferred  upon him under the law set out in the First Schedule to that Act. And that the Motor Vehicle  (Tax  on  Registration  and  Transfers)  Act  Cap.  124,  (Cap 124) which is relevant in this case is included under Item  12 thereof.

In  his rejoinder,  Mr.  Richard argued that section  14 (1) (a) (b) (c) of the TRAA provides remedies other than claim for damages hence the Board  has  no  jurisdiction  over  the  same.  That  section  6  of  the  TRAA ought to  be  read  together  with  other  laws.  He  finally  argued  that the issues in relation to section 7 of the TRAA were not raised in the case of New Musoma Textiles Limited (supra).

We  have  considered  the  submissions  by  the  learned  counsel  for the  parties  and  find  a  crucial  issue  to  decide  is  whether  the  trial  court had  jurisdiction to entertain this matter. We  wish  to preface our determination  by  reaffirming  a  trite  law  that  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate any matter is a creature of a  statute  [see for instance R.  S.  A  Limited v. Hanspaul  Automechs  Limited  Govinderajan  Senthil  Kumal, Civil  Appeal  No.

- 179  of  2016  (unreported)].  That  being  the  position, section  7  (1)  of the  Civil  Procedure  Code  [CAP  33  R.E.  2019]  provides thus:

" Subject to this Act the courts have jurisdiction to try ail suits of  a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is expressly or impliedly barred."

In  the  instant  case,  the  respondent  has  been  emphatic  that  the jurisdiction  of  ordinary  courts  has  been  ousted  as  regards  disputes  of civil nature arising out of the revenue laws administered by  the respondent  making  reference  to  section  7  of the  TRAA.  Whereas,  the appellant has maintained that the proceedings of a civil nature envisaged  in  that  law  do  not  include  claim  for  damages  but  those relating  to tax  assessment.  He  based  his argument on  sections  7A and 12  of  the  TRAA.  For  clarity,  we  find  it  apposite  to  reproduce  these provisions of law at the time of the dispute as follows:

" Section 7.  The Board shall have sole original  jurisdiction in all  proceedings  of a  civil  nature  in  respect  of disputes arising from revenue laws administered by the Tanzania Revenue Authority.

Section 7 A. The Board shall not entertain any appeal arising from assessment of tax unless section 12 of this Act is complied with.

Section 12. -(1) Any person  who  disputes  an  assessment made upon him may, by notice in writing to the Commissioner General, object to the assessment."

Our  understanding  of these  provisions  is that  all  proceedings  of a  civil nature  arising  out  of  disputes  from  revenue  laws  administered  by  the respondent ought to be dealt with by the Board. Furthermore, the Board is  precluded  from  entertaining  any  appeal  relating  to  tax  assessment unless  a  written  notice  to  the  Commissioner  is  made.  We  are  of  the considered view  that  tax assessment  is  one of  the categories  of proceedings of a  civil  nature  upon which the  Board  has  been  conferred jurisdiction  to  determine.  Therefore,  section  12  above  did  not  mean  to limit  the  proceedings  of  a  civil  nature  to  assessment  of  tax  only  but meant to provide the procedure upon which to access the Board.

In  the  instant  case,  the  dispute  arose  when  the  respondent  was administering  one  of  the  revenue  laws.  This  is  Cap. 124  which  is referred to under section 6 of the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act thus.

"Any person  who is aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioner-General  in relation to any  act or omission  in the  course  of  the  discharge of  any function conferred upon him under the law set out in the  First  Schedule  to  this  Act ■ may  appeal  to  the Board in  accordance  with  the provisions of the  Tax Revenue Appeals Act . "

Item  12  of the  First  Schedule  mentions  Cap.  124  which  is the  revenue law  that  the  respondent  was  administering  when  the  instant  dispute arose. In  that  case  the  law  required  any  aggrieved  party to  appeal to the  Board  in  accordance  with  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Act. It  goes without saying that the appellant who was aggrieved by the respondent's act when  he was administering the said  revenue  law was

not  exempted  from  knocking  the  doors  of  the  Board  to  present  his claims.

The  counsel  for  the  parties  also  locked  horns  over  section  14  of the TRAA which provides:

- "(1) Any  person aggrieved  by-
- (a) The  calculation  by  the  Commissioner-General  of the amount due for refund, drawback or repayment of  any tax, duty, levy or charge;
- (b) A  refusal by the  Commissioner-  General to make any refund or repayment; or
- (c) The  decision  by  the Commissioner  General  to register,  or refusal to register,  any trader for the purpose of Value Added Tax  Act, may appeal to the Board."

While  Mr.  Maswanyia  suggested that the appellant could  have accessed the Board through that provision, Mr.  Richard strongly opposed that idea for  the  reason  that  claim  of  damages  is  not  one  of the  categories  of reliefs listed under that provision. On our part, we hold the view that the type  of  relief  does not  determine  jurisdiction. Thus,  the  claim for

compensation may  not  have been listed in the provision but  the controlling provision remains to be section 7 thereof that any proceedings of a civil nature arising from the respondent's administration of revenue laws ought to be determined by the Board.

Mr. Richard further  argued  that  the  case  of New  Musoma Textiles Limited (supra) is distinguishable from  the instant case because in that case the Court did  not interpret section  7 of the TRAA. We  do  not  agree  with  this  line  of  argument  because  in  that  case  the Court  considered  the  claim  arising  out  of  the  respondent's  distrained goods  by  the  appellant  to  be  civil  in  nature  hence  justiciable  by  the Board. The Court stated at page 11 that:

"In  view  of the  above  analysis,  our  answer  to  the posed issue is that the matter that was taken before the High Court by way of Civil Case No.  22 of 2006, was  a  proceeding  of a  civil  nature  in  respect  of a dispute arising from a revenue law,  to  wit,  the  Value Added Tax Act (supra).  Since the law is one of those administered by the appellant and on  which  the  Tax Appeals Board had  sole original  jurisdiction to determine  disputes  arising  therefrom  and since  the respondent has not shown to the Court that he could not obtain an appropriate remedy from the Board, the

## High Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit."

The  same  view  was  expressed  in  the  case  of Khofu  Mlewa (supra)  where  the  claim  against the  respondent  was  for  compensation for  sale  of certain  uncustomed  goods  which  had  been  seized  from  the appellant. The Court stated at page 9 that:

"To begin with, we think it  is necessary to reaffirm the position in New Musoma Textiles Limited (supra) that ; in  terms of section 7 of the Act,  the Board has the sole original  jurisdiction in all  proceedings of  a civil nature arising from the revenue laws administered by the TRA. In  addition, in that  decision the  Court restated the rule as per section 7 (1) of the CPC that courts (including the High Court) have jurisdiction to try all manner of  civil  suits except those of  which their "cognizance is either expressly or impliedly  barred."

For  the  foregoing  analysis,  we  are  settled  in  our  mind  that  the appellant's  claim  was  of  a  civil  nature  arising  from  the  respondent's administration of one of the  revenue  laws. Thus,  according to section  7 of the TRAA it  is only the  Board  that  has jurisdiction  to determine that claim.  It  follows  therefore  that;  the  trial  court  had  no  jurisdiction  to determine the suit between the parties.

Consequently,  we  uphold  the decision  of the  High  Court and  find the appeal devoid of merit which we hereby dismiss with costs.
