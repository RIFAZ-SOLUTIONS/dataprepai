This is an application for leave to appeal before the Court of Appeal made under section 5( l ) ( c ) of the Appellate jurisdiction Act Cap 141 R. E . 2019, and rule 45 of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, R.E. 2019, section 95 and Order XLIII rule 2 of Civil  Procedure Code R.E. 2019. The applicant being  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  High  Court,  Main  Registry  Dar  es salaam,  by Hon.  Feleshi J.K.  in  Misc.  Civil Application  no.  57 of 2020 is intending  to  appeal  to  the  Court  of Appeal,  hence  this Application  for leave.

Instead of addressing the court orally, parties made their submissions in writing pursuant to the order of this court. Both were represented. While Mr. Gabriel Malata, the Solicitor General, appeared  for  Applicants, Yohanes Konda,learned Advocate, appeared for Respondent.

Mr.  Malata opened the arena by adopting  his own affidavit to form part of his submission.  He thereafter submitted on the question of  jurisdiction of High Court  in exercising judicial review, powers  to adjudicate application  for extension  of time,  and  subsequent application for  leave and  judicial  review  of  the  decision  of  the  Commissioner  General  of Tanzania Revenue Authority exercising his power under Tax Administration Law.

The  respondent applied  for extension  of time  to file  an  application  for leave  to  apply  for  prerogative  orders  of  certiorari  and  mandamus  to challenge the act by the 1 s t  Applicant of not delivering the decision on tax objection preferred by the Respondent under the Tax Laws, issuance of the agency Notice without assessment being made and that revocation of the private ruling issued in favour of the Applicant was unjustified.

Further,  he  submitted  that jurisdiction  of the  court or  any  organ  is  a creature of the constitution or statute. The application  before the court which rendered the impugned decision was seeking its intervention in the

dispute arising from the Tax  Laws.  He cited  section  7 of Cap 408  R.E. 2019  and  said  that  it  is  with  no  iota  of doubt that tax  disputes  have exclusive forums for determining the same. He also relied on the cases of Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority v Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ), Consolidated, Civil Appeal no. 78 &amp; 79 of 2018, and Pan  African Energy  v. Commissioner  General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 89 of 2019.

The  learned  Solicitor General  invoked  sections  7  and  16(1)  of the  Act which  provide for the  right to appeal,  and  where to appeal,  in case of being dissatisfied  by any decision  arising  from  tax laws.  He was of the view that the  parliament intended  to vest powers to adjudicate on tax disputes to Tax Appeal Board (TAB), Tax Revenue Appeal Tribunal (TRAT) and the Court of Appeal. He argued that such intention is underscored in a number of decisions including Vodacom Tanzania Public Ltd. Co. v The Commissioner General TRA and another (Misc.  Civil cause no. 33 of 2020. In respect of the case at hand, this issue raises an arguable principle of law which need to be determined by the Court of Appeal of Tanzania.

On the second point of law to be discussed by the Court of Appeal, the learned Solicitor General  submitted that on  29t h  January, 2021 and  12t h

February 2021 the respondent herein initiated an appeal process to the Tax Revenue Appeal Board by notice of appeal and statement of appeal No. 48 of 2021 between Mirambo Limited and Commissioner General TRA Challenging  the  decision  of  1 s t   Applicant  of issuing  agency  notice  and notice of revocation of the private ruling. At the same time the respondent filed  Misc.  Civil Application  No.  57 of 2020 for extension of time. This is against the  principle  that one  should  not ride two  horses  at a  time  in pursuing his rights. The principle was propounded by the Court of Appeal in Serengeti Breweries Limited vs Hector Sequiraa, Civil Application No. 395/18, CAT at DSM

Regarding the third point of law to be discussed by the Court of Appeal which is the effect of respondent's failure to account for each and every day of the delay in the application for extension of time, the applicants submitted  that the same was  not caused  by Applicants' srlence  by not replying the Respondent's  complaint  and notice of  objection. The respondent ought to have appealed against the decision  under the Tax Revenue Appeal Act and that, the failure by the 1 s t  applicant to respond to the objections amounted to nothing but to the fact that the objections has been disallowed.

It was further submitted that there was no sufficient reason for extension of time warranting the application for judicial review by the Respondent. Revocation of the second private ruling by itself constitute a decision of the  Commissioner  of Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  in  accordance  with section  50(1)  of the  Tax  Administration  Act  Cap.  438  R.E.  2019.  The argument  that  the  applicant  was  trying  to  exhaust  all  the  remedies available  including  asking  the  intervention  of the  2n d  applicant  is  not a good  cause  for  delay  as  the  remedies  she  was  exhausting  are  not statutory. Thus, the delay was caused or contributed by the respondent's dilatory conducts.

As to the duty of accounting for each  and  every day of the delay, the learned Solicitor General cited the case of Lyamuya construction Co. Ltd  vs  The  board  of  Registered  Trustees  of  Young  Women's Christian Association of  Tanzania, Civil Application no. 2 of 2010, and concluded that in the instant matter the delay was unreasonable as the respondent never acted promptly and failed to show any due diligence on her part to pursue her case.

The counsel for the  respondent replied  on what was submitted  by the learned Solicitor General. He was of  the view that  it  is legally wrong, under

r

section  5(2)(d) of The Appellate Jurisdiction Act Cap  141  R.E.  2019 for the applicants to apply for leave to appeal against an interlocutory order of the Court to override the Applicants' preliminary Objection on the lack of  jurisdiction. The court overruled the objections and proceeded to grant extension  of time within  which  the  Respondent herein  would  apply for leave  to  file  an  application  for  prerogative  orders  of  certiorari  and mandamus.

The case of Tanzania Ports Corporation versus Jeremiah Mwandi, Civil  Appeal  No.  474  of  2020,  was  invoked  by  the  counsel  for  the respondent in  relation  to the  meaning  of interlocutory order.  Likewise, cases such  as JUNACO (T) Limited and Justine Lambert v.  Harei Mallac Tanzania Limited, Civil application  No. 473 of 2016, Murtaza Ally Mangungu vs The Returning Officer of Kilwa and 2 others, Civil  Application  No.  80  of  2016,  and Peter  Noel  Kingamkono  v. Tropica!  Pesticide  Research, Civil  Application  No.  2   of  2009  were equally cited.

The learned counsel further went on explaining that it is only the High Court that is vested with the jurisdiction to grant leave and  prerogative orders of mandamus and certiorari. The Application No. 57 of 2020 was it was argued not a tax matter.  Rather, it was an application in which the

Respondent was challengingthe misuse of public powers conferred to the first  applicant.  The  misuse of public  powers  by the  1 s t  Applicant  is the revocation  of the  private  ruling  and  the  immediate  issuance  of agency notice and the usurpation of  TZS 146,118,017,395/= from the respondent without an assessment or a tax liability calculated confirmed against the Respondent was contrary to the governing laws amounting to illegalities remediable by a way of an application for judicial review. The illegalities committed  and inaction by  the 1s t Applicant  on the respondent's objections, that has impacted unexplainable anguish to the respondent, would only be determined by the High court through quashing his decision and directing to act in accordance with the law.

He went on saying where there is an alternative remedy, the respondent for prerogative orders ought to, as a matter of general rule, exhaust that remedy. This was stated in the case of Deusdedit Sylvanus Malebo v. The Chief Court Administrator, the Judicial Service Commission and the Attorney General, Misc. Civil cause No. 15 of 2018 which cited  with  approval  the  case  of Obadia  Salehe  vs  Dodoma  wine Company Ltd [1990] TLR 113.

â„¢e cited cases by the applicants  support the argument on the lack jurisdiction of the court.  Thus court is seized with a matter premised Of on the judicial  review  and  not original  tax  dispute  or  appeal  governed  by provisions of article 107A (2) and 108 of the constitution

With regards to forum shopping, he submitted that, the application before the high court was filed before this court on 15t h  December, 2020 whereas Appeal  No.  3 of 2021  against Stamp duty Assessment No.  2/2019;  No. 2/2019; appeal no. 49 of 2021 against the agency notice; and Appeal no. 50 of 2021 against the Agency notice were filed on  12t h  February, 2021. The present application  was filed  even  before the expiration  of the six months'  period  which  are  required  for  the  one  to  appeal  to  the  Tax Revenue Appeal Board. The case of Serengeti Breweries Limited vs Hector Sequiraa, is distinguishable from  the  present application. The application  is  purely  concerned  with  the  legality  of the  1 s t   applicant's action in administering tax laws.

As far as time is concerned, the counsel submitted that the respondent accounted for each day of delay as stated in the affidavit in support of applications. The application was cleared for filing on 15t h  December, 2020 and the Lyamuya's case is inapplicable in this application.

In rejoinder, the learned Solicitor General reiterated that the respondent's submission  that  this leave is for  appeal on interlocutory  order  is irrelevancy, illogical and misconception based on the facts what applicants

are seeking before this court is for leave to appeal the whole ruling and Drawn  order in  Misc.  civil  Application  No.  57  of 2020  prompted  under section  5(l)(c)  of the  Appellate  Jurisdiction  Act  and  rule  45(a)  of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules and section 95 and Order XLII rule 2 of Civil Procedure Code. He referred the case of Tanzania Posts Corporation vs Jeremia  Mwandi (supra)  where the court of appeal raised  the  issue  of nature  of order test which  requires  to  answer questions; whether remedies were sought and whether all remedies were determined  conclusively  by  the  high  court.  Applying  the  test,  Civil Application No.  57 of 2020 was seeking for extension of time to file an application  for  leave  to  apply  for  prerogative  orders  of  certiorari  and mandamus  and  ruling  and  drawn  order  of  the  High  court  in  Civil Application No. 57 of 2020 was final and conclusively determined.

Further,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  action  or  conducts  which  were challenged by the respondent were those done by the 1s t  Applicant while administering  Tax  Laws,  thus  any  dispute  arising  from  them  is  a  tax dispute emanated from the exercise of powers vested to the Commissioner  General  of  Tax  under  the  TAA. Cases  cited by  the respondent to  support  his  argument are  distinguishable  as  they  apply

where  the  court  is  not  ousted  with  jurisdiction  and  rest  where  other remedies are available but not efficiently.

While concluding  the applicants submitted that application  for  leave to appeal to the court of Appeal of Tanzania, the applicant is only required to  raise  arguable  point  of  law  and  the  trial  court  must  refrain  from determining substantive issues before  the  appeal regardless  those grounds raised have merits or not. Bulyanhulu Gold Mine Limited and 2 others vs Petrolube (T) Limited and another, Civil application No. 364/2016 of 2017.

I have considered the rival submission by parties and I wish to stress that this is an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal and it will not  deeply  go  to  the  facts  to  be  discussed  in  the  intended  appeal. However,  the  grounds  of  intended  appeal  can  be  captured  from  the Applicants' affidavit at paragraph 8 to read: -

- (i) The jurisdiction of the  High  Court of Tanzania exercising Judicial review powers to adjudicate application for extension of time and subsequent application for leave and Judicial Review of the decision of Commissioner General of Tanzania  Revenue Authority exercising  powers under the Tax Administration Laws.

- (ii) The  effects  of  Respondent's  action  pursuing  the  same matter  (forum  shopping/  riding  two  horses  at  a  time) through the remedies available under the Tax Administration Laws.
- (iii) The  effects  of  Respondent's  failure  to  account  for  the number  of  days  delayed  in  filling  the  application  for extension of time.

The  same  were  disputed  by  the  Respondent  saying Miscellaneous Application No. 57 of 2020 from which this application originated is not a tax matter but an application for challenging the 1 s t  Applicant's misuse of power of revocation  of private  ruling followed  by  immediate  issuing  of agency  notice  and  usurpation  of  Tzs 146,118,017,395/=. For  the allegation of forum shopping, the same was misconceived as two alleged matters are different from each other, one is on substantive issue while the other is on illegalities and the first to be filed. Also, failure to account for one day of delay was disputed to the extent that the Applicants are to blame  tHemselves  for  respondents time lost  waiting  for 1Applicant response from the Respondent's letters.

Basically,  this  application  is  brought  under section  5(1X0 of  the Appellate Jurisdiction Act Cap 141 R.E. 2019 which provides: -

'any  appeal  shall  lie to the court  of  appeal with the leave of  the High Court or of  the Court of  Appeal, against every other decree, order, judgment, decision or finding of  the High Court'.

However, the law does not provide for criteria upon which the leave shall be granted. It remains as an issue this court has to answer. This has been taken care in number of cases such as Hamis Mdia and Another vs the Registered Trustees of Islamic Foundation, Civil Appeal No. 232 of 2018, CAT at Tabora (unreported) where it held that:

"While the application for  leave must  state succinctly the factual or legal issues arising from the matter and demonstrate to the court that the proposed grounds of appeal merit an appeal,  the court concerned should decide  whether the said proposed grounds are prima fade worthy  of  consideration of  the Court of  Appeal . "

in Harban Haji Mosi and Another Vrs Omar Hilai Seif and Another, Civil Reference No. 19 of 1997 CAT, the following principles were laid down;

,leave is grantable where the proposed appeal stands reasonable chances of success or where/ but not necessarily the proceedings a5  a  whole  reveals  such  disturbing  feature  as  to  require  the guidance of the Coud of  Appeal.  The purpose of the provision is

therefore to spare the court the spectre of  un meriting matters and to  enable  it to give  adequate  attention  to  cases of true public importance"

I  have carefully considered the application, the supporting affidavit and counter affidavit together with the submissions by the parties in support and  opposition  of the  application  in  line  with  the  guiding  principle  as enunciated in the case authorities cited above. As rightly submitted by the Respondent, what is before me is just the application for leave, it is out of mandate to revisit the evidence at the trial court to reach at its decision. What I  am  required  to  do,  is  to  look from  the  material  before  me  to ascertain whether there are points shown to entitle the grant of leave to appeal.

Applying the principle in tne aDove reiieu on  duuiunucs,  i find arguable point of law which the Court of Appeal has to answer as whether this court has jurisdiction to exercise Judicial Review Power on acts or decisions of Commissioner General of Tanzania Revenue Authorities while exercising Tax laws, whether the respondent did forum shopping when by bringing this  application  before this court and  whether the  respondent failed  to account for a one-day delay.

In the results, there is need for the Court of Appeal to adjudicate upon the  rival  contentions  by  the  parties,  specifically  on  the  issues  raised. Consequently,  I  find  merit  in  this  application.  I  accordingly  grant  the orders sought in the chamber summons. The costs shall follow events.
