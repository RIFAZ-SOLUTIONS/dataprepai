## RULING OF THE COURT

27th  May &amp; 24th  June, 2016

## MUSSA, J.A.:

The  respondent  was  dissatisfied  by  the  decision  of  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal which was pronounced on the 22n d November, 2013.  In response, she duly filed a Notice of appeal on the 5t h   December,  2013 which was received and acknowledged by counsel for the applicant on the 6th  December, 2013.  Thereafter, according to the applicant, the respondent  took  no  further  action, hence  the application at hand.

In  effect,  the  application  seeks  to  move the  Court to  strike  out the  respondent's  Notice  of Appeal  on  the  ground  that some  essential step in the proceedings has not been taken within the prescribed time. The application is by Notice of Motion which is predicated under Rules 60(2)  and  89(2)  of  the  Tanzania  Court  of  Appeal  Rules,  2009  (the Rules). The same is supported  by an affidavit sworn  by Mr.  Onesmo Kyauke who held himself as an Advocate of the applicant.  In addition, the applicant has lodged written submissions in support  of  the application.

When  the  application  was  called  on  for  hearing  before  us,  the applicant was  represented  by  Mr.  Makarious Tairo,  learned Advocate. The respondent was absent despite being duly served and, accordingly, we ordered the application to proceed in her absence.

Mr. Tairo fully adopted the  Notice of Motion,  the accompanying affidavit as well as the written submissions in support of the application. Elaborating  the  applicant's  written  submissions,  Mr.  Tairo  contended

that after lodging the Notice of Appeal, the respondent was notified of the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal in a letter written by the Registrar of the Tribunal and dated the 12th  December, 2013.  The notification  letter,  he said,  also enclosed the copy of the  proceedings, judgment and the decree of the Tribunal.  The learned counsel for the applicant  informed  us  that  the  notification  letter  is  appended  to  the Notice  of Motion  which  was  served  upon  the  respondent  on  the  16t h September,  2014. To  this  date, Mr.  Tairo  further  submitted,  the respondent has not instituted the appeal within the prescribed time as required  by  Rule  90(1)  of  the  Rules  and,  accordingly,  the  learned counsel  for the  applicant  urged  us to  strike  out the  Notice  of Appeal with costs.

Having heard the learned counsel for the applicant, it seems clear to us that the respondent was duly served with the Notice of Motion on the  16t h   September,  2014. Then,  a  little  later,  on  the  6t h   November, 2014 the respondent was just as well served with the applicant's written submissions in support of the application. And, yet, for some obscure cause,  the  respondent  adopted  a  passive  stance  and  made  no  effort whatsoever to counter the applicant's quest either by way of an affidavit

in  reply or written submission.  Thus, to this end, the factual averments as contained in the applicant's affidavit stand uncontested.

It  is  common  ground  that  this  application  revolves  around  the question  whether or  not the  respondent is  in  breach  of Rule  90(1)  of the Rules which stipulates:  -

"90.  -(1) Subject to the provisions of  Rule 128 ' an appeal shall be instituted by lodging in the appropriate  registry, within  sixty days  of the date when the notice of  appeal was lodged with

- (a) a memorandum of appeal in quintuplicate;
- (b) the record of appeal in quintuplicate;
- (c) security for the costs o f  the appeal,

Save that where an application fora copy  of  the proceedings in the High Court has been made within  thirty days o f the  date  of the  decision against which it  is  desired  to appeal, there shall, in computing the time within which the appeal is to be instituted  be excluded  such time as  may be certified by the Registrar of the High Court

## as having been required  for the  preparation and delivery of  that copy to the appellant."

Unfortunately,  on  account  of  the  respondent's  passiveness,  it cannot  be  ascertained  whether  or  not  the  respondent  wrote  the Tribunal  Registrar to  request for a copy of the  proceedings and,  if so, whether  or  not  she  copied  the  requesting  letter  to  the  applicant  to entitle herself to rely on the proviso to Rule (90)(1) of the Rules.  That being so and, there being no certificate of delay, it was incumbent upon the  respondent to  institute the appeal within  sixty (60) days from the date  when  the  Notice  of  Appeal  was  lodged. As  we  have  already indicated, the Notice of Appeal was lodged on the 5th  December, 2013 but,  having done so, the respondent did not take any further step and, more specifically,  she did  not,  at all,  institute the appeal. As to what results  from  such  inaction,  we  need  do  no  more  than  reiterate  our observation  in the unreported  Civil Application  No.  4 of 2011 Olivia Kisinja Mdete Vs Hilda Mkinga: -

"The law is now settled,  upon lodging a Notice of  Appeal,  the intending appellant must not sit back  but  is  required  to  move  the  process forward  by  taking  essential  steps  that  have

been  clearly outlined by  the  Court of Appeal Rules. The applicant was entitled to move the Court under Rule 89(2) to strike out a notice of appeal  where  no  essential  steps  have  been taken beyond that notice."

All  said,  we find  merits  in  the application  which we,  accordingly, allow. The Notice of Appeal filed  by the respondent is,  hereby,  struck out with costs. It is so ordered.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this  16th  day of June,  2016.
