## RULING OF THE COURT

23d &amp; 2 &lt; ? h  September, 2022

## MUGASHA. J.A.:

In this appeal, the appellant, Mwenga Hydro Limited is challenging the decision  of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal. A brief background  underlying  the  present appeal  is that,  the appellant was involved  in  the  construction  of  Mwenga  3 Hydro  Electricity  Plant project together with its partner Mufindi Tea Company (MTC) who had entered  into  a  contract  of  energy  facility  grant  with  the  European Community for the implementation. This entailed,  construction  of the

power plant and ensuring that the institutional settings are in place for the operation and  maintenance of the power plant. According to item 2 of  the Third Schedule  to the Value Added  Tax, supplies or importation  of goods  and  services  under donor  funded  schemes  are eligible  for  special  reliefs.  Since  the  project  in  question  was  donor funded, on 13/1/2011, the Ministry of Finance requested the respondent to exempt the appellant to pay import duty for the goods and services procured under the project in terms of article 31 of Annex IV of the ACP -  EU Partnership Agreement of Cotonou.

The  response  of  the  respondent  was  to  the  effect  that,  the project was to  be exempted  import duty  in terms of the  East African Community Customs  Management Act,  2004  paragraph  10  in  the  5t h Schedule and the 3r d  Schedule to the Value Added Tax Act,  1997 (the VAT  Act).  That  apart,  on  24/11/2011  it  was  also  brought  to  the attention  of  the  appellant  that  as  the  project  was  co-financed  by European  Union  and  Mufindi Tea  Company,  entitlement to  relief was on the fund from European Union.

Subsequently, in 2014, the respondent conducted a tax audit on the appellant covering the year of income ending 2012 and claimed to have  gathered  that  VAT  on  imported  services  from  the  month  of October 2012, was not accounted for. The appellant fronted explanation  to  the  effect  that,  the  company  was  exempted  VAT  on procured goods and services for the construction of the hydroelectricity facility and distribution of network. After some engagement with the  respondent which  involved exchange of several correspondences, the respondent maintained  her stance and  issued  a VAT assessment on imported services for the month of October, 2012 at  the  tune  of  TZS.  218,700,000.00  plus  TZS.  75,162.899.14  being interest,  the  reason  advanced  by  the  respondent  was  that  the  VAT was  unaccounted  contrary  to  the  dictates  of  the  Value  Added  Tax (Imported Services) Regulations, 2004.

The appellant unsuccessfully objected the assessment which was turned down  by the respondent who confirmed the initial assessment and  demanded  the  appellant  to  comply  and  pay  the  assessed  tax. Undaunted, the appellant unsuccessfully appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) which  dismissed the appeal. Further

aggrieved  the  appellant  preferred  an  appeal  to  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals  Tribunal  (the  Tribunal)  fronting  five  grounds  of  complaint reproduced hereunder for ease of reference:

- 1.  That the  Board erred in law and in fact in holding that the appellant  violated  the  requirements  of  section  26  of  the Value Added Tax Act,  1997 and  Regulation  6 of the Value Added Tax (Imported Services) Regulations, 2001.
- 2.  The Board erred in fact and law in holding  that the Appellant's correction of error on nonaccounting of imported  services  under  Regulation  4(2) of  the  Value Added Tax (Correction of Errors) Regulations, 2000 was an afterthought.
- 3.  The Board erred in fact and law in holding  that the respondent was justified  in  assessing  and  demanding the tax  due  of  VAT  on  imported  services  in  terms  of  the provisions of section 43(1) of the Value Added Tax 1997.
- 4.  The  Board erred  in fact and law by failing to hold that the Appellant being entitled to VAT special relief under section

11 and the 3r d  Schedule to the Value Added Tax Act,  1997 is not  liable  to  VAT  under  section  43  (1)  of  the  Value Added Tax Act, 1997.

- 5.  The  Board  erred  in  fact  and  law  by  failing  to  make  a determination on the reduction of value of services.

The Tribunal purported to have determined only four grounds of appeal and it directed that the case file be remitted to the Board for it to determine the 5* ground of appeal. It is against the said backdrop; the  appellant  has  preferred  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the Tribunal  raising  three grounds of complaint.  However,  on  account of what  will  be  apparent  in  due  course  we  shall  not  reproduce  the grounds of appeal.

At the hearing, the appellant was represented by Wilson Mukebezi, learned counsel whereas the respondent had the services of Messrs. Harold Gugami, Hospis Maswanyia, learned Senior  State Attorneys and Mr. Athumani Mruma, learned State Attorney.

Before  proceeding  to  hear  the  appeal,  we  wanted  to  satisfy ourselves on the propriety of the Tribunal's decision which determined

four grounds of appeal  and ordered the  remaining fifth ground to be remitted  to  the  trial  Board  for  determination.  Upon  taking  floor,  Mr. Wilson Mukebezi faulted the course  taken by the Tribunal. He submitted that,  before  proceeding to  make any determination  on the appeal, the Tribunal could have remitted the case file to the trial Board for it to make a decision on the undetermined matter.

In  the  alternative,  the  learned  counsel  pointed  out that,  in  the absence of prescribed  procedure of dealing with the like matter in the Tax Revenue Appeals Act and Rules made thereunder, he argued that, in terms of section 76 (1) and (2) of the Civil  Procedure Act [  CAP 33 R.E 2019]  (the CPC) the Tribunal sitting as first appellate court ought to have stepped into the shoes of the Board to do what ought to have been done by the trial Board. In this regard, he implored on the Court to  return  the  case  file  to the Tribunal  and  direct  it to  determine the remaining fifth ground  of appeal. The  learned counsel  viewed  this as the best option to remedy the matter under scrutiny.

On the other hand, initially, the learned counsel for the respondent  were  not  comfortable  with  the  course  advanced  by  Mr.

Mukebezi. Apart from conceding that it was not proper for the Tribunal to remit the matter to the Board, they were of the view that,  it is still open  for  the  Court  to  dispose  of the  appeal  before  it.  Upon  being probed  by the Court on the statutory limitation  on the Court which is vested  with  jurisdiction  to entertain  appeals on  questions  of law  and not fact and  given that the  respondent did  not file any cross appeal, upon  reflection  they  urged  the  Court  to  return  the  case  file  to  the Tribunal for it to determine the remaining ground on complaint.

After  a  careful  consideration  of  the  submission  of  counsel  for either side and the record before us, at the outset, it is crucial to point out that, the matter at hand  is a test case to the principle on the role of appellate  court in  determining  a  first appeal  before  it.  In terms of the provisions of section 16 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act [CAP 408 R.E.2019] (the TRAA) the Tribunal is clothed with appellate jurisdiction to determine appeals from the Board which is vested with sole original jurisdiction  in  all  proceedings  of  civil  nature  in  respect  of  disputes arising  from  revenue  laws  administered  by  the  Tanzania  Revenue Authority. See: section 7 of the TRAA.

As  gathered in the decision of  the  Tribunal, although the appellant  fronted  five  grounds  of appeal,  the  Tribunal  purported  to have  disposed  part of appeal  and  directed  the  remaining  part  to  be determined by the Board. The question to be answered is whether this was  a  proper  course  considering  that  the  Tribunal  sat  as  a  first appellate court on the matter. In the case of PETER MWAFRIKA VS. REPUBLIC, Criminal Appeal  No. 413 of 2013  (unreported), the Court sitting as  first appellate Court  having  discussed the role of  the appellate court, relied on the case of BERM  AX  VS. AUSTIN MOTORS COMPANY LTD [1955] ALL ER 326 the Court held:

"An  appellate  court,  on  appeal  from  a  case tried before  a judge  alone,  should not differ from a finding of  the trial  judge on a question of fact.  But distinction in this respect must be drawn  between  the  perception  of facts  and evaluation of  facts. Where  there  is  no question of credibility of witnesses,  but the sole question is the proper inference to be  drawn  from  specific  facts, an appellate  court is in a good position  to

## evaluate the evidence as the trial judge..."

[Emphasis supplied]

See  also: PATRICK JEREMIAH  VS.  REPUBLIC, Criminal  Appeal No. 34 of 2006 (unreported).

In  the  case  at  hand,  the  issue  on  the  reduction  of  value  of imported  services  was  not  a  question  of credibility  of witnesses,  but rather  a  question  on  the  proper  inference  to  be  drawn  from  specific facts.  This  being  a  factual  issue  could  still  have  been  determined  by the Tribunal to finality.  However, on account of what transpired before the  Tribunal,  its  decision  is  surrounded  by  uncertainty.  We  say  so because  initially,  at  page  365  having  addressed  the  5t h   ground  of appeal  as a  factual  issue,  what  had  transpired  before  the  Board  and case law, at page 365 the Tribunal stated as follows:

1 1 uided by the above authority,  we have the G view that the trial Board did no wrong for not determining issue/prayer which  was posed by the appellant at the start of  the hearing. If  the appei/ant found that the issue was  very important to be  determined by the

Board, [it] was supposed to ask for amendment of additional issues  so  that  the said  issue  couid  be  included  in  the  framed issues for  determination."

[Emphasis supplied]

Subsequently, the Tribunal  concluded what is  reflected  at page 368 of the record of appeal as follows:

" Coming back to our matter at hand,  we have seen  that the Appellant still [is] insisting that the issue of reduction should be determined. As far as the same was not determined by the trial Board,  we  find it necessary for the said controversy  to  be  determined  by  the Trial Board.

To  this  end  by  virtue  of the  evidence  and arguments adduced in the preceding paragraphs we are of the view that [the]Appellant failed to substantiate his case in the first,  second,  third and fourth grounds of Appeal. As to the fifth ground,  we are of the view that the Board  be given opportunity for the determination of the taxable  value in respect of the imported

services, . We further order that the case be remitted to the trial Board for hearing on the controversy (sic) issue.  Each party to bear his or  her own costs."

## [Emphasis supplied]

In  the  light  of  the  reproduced  portion  of  the  decision  of  the Tribunal  it  cannot  be  safely  vouched  if  the  appeal before  it  was determined  to  finality. Apparently, as  correctly  submitted by  the learned counsel, the TRAA and the  Rules  made thereunder are silent on the course to be taken which  brings to scene the CPC a statute of general  application  on  the  procedure  and  related  matters  in  civil proceedings. This takes us to the provisions of section  76 (1) (a) and (2) which stipulates as follows:

(1) Subject to such conditions and iimitations as may be prescribed,  the High  Court in  the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction shall have power-

## (a) to determine a case finally;

- (b) N/A;
- (C) N/A;

## (d) N/A;

(2)  Subject to  any conditions and limitations prescribed  under  subsection (1), the High Court shali have  the same powers and shall perform, as nearly as may be, the same duties as are conferred and imposed by this Code on courts of  original  jurisdiction in respect of  suits instituted  therein.

## [Emphasis supplied]

In  the  light of the  bolded  expression,  it was  incumbent for the Tribunal  sitting  as  an  appellate  court  ought  to  have  determined  the appeal  to  finality  and with certainty. Thus, in the  wake  of  the uncertainty  surrounding  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal,  it  cannot  be safely vouched that the appeal was determined to finality. This is with respect,  not  compatible  with  sound  policy  in  the  timely  dispensing justice which requires that, litigation must come to an end.

In  view  of  what  we  have  endeavored  to  discuss,  on  the  way forward,  we  invoke  our  revisional  powers  under  section  4(2)  of the Appellate Jurisdiction  Act  [CAP  141  R.E.  2019]  to  cure  the  anomaly. Given the nature of the dispute, it is in the interest of justice that, the

Tribunal  must  determine  the  appeal  in  its  entirety  and  not  in  piece meals. We thus quash and set aside the judgment of the Tribunal and remit  the  case  file to  the  Tribunal for it to  compose  a proper judgment.  Meanwhile, the  purported appeal  is hereby struck out with no order as to costs. It is so ordered.
