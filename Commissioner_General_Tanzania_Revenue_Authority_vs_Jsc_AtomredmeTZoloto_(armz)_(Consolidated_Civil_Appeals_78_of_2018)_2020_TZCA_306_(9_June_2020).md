## RULING OF THE COURT

1s t  &amp; 9t h  June, 2020

## MUGASHA. J.A.:

The appellant, Commissioner General of Tanzania  Revenue Authority (CGTRA), is challenging the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the  Tribunal)  which  sustained  the  decision  of the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Board  (the  Board). Having  been  unsuccessful  in  the  first  and  second

appeal,  the  appellant  lodged  an  appeal  to  the  Court  challenging  the decisions of the Board and the Tribunal.

In  order to  understand  what precipitated the  present  matter before us,  it  is  crucial  to  narrate  a   brief  background  as  follows:  The  respondent JSC  Atom  red  metzolo  (ARMZ)  is  a  chartered  open  Joint  Stock  Company incorporated in the Russian Federation dealing in uranium mining industry. On 15/12/2010, the respondent  purchased from the  Australia Stock Exchange  all  shares  in  Mantra  Resources  Limited  (Mantra  Resources)  a company  incorporated  in  Australia  and  owner  of  Mkuju  River  Uranium project located in Namtumbo District, Ruvuma Region.

In December  2010  the  respondent  purchased  shares  in Mantra Australia  and  on 15t h December  2010  the  respondent  entered  into  a Scheme Implementation  Agreement (SIA)  with  Mantra  Australia  pursuant to which the  respondent purchased  100% of the  issued  shares  in  Mantra Australia on the Australia Stock Exchange (ASX).  Following the acquisition of all the issued shares in  Mantra Australia, the respondent became a sole registered  and  beneficiary  owner  of  shares  in  Mantra  Australia  making Mantra  Australia  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the  respondent.  Hence Mantra Tanzania and  Mkuju  River Uranium  Project were placed  under the

control  of the  respondent  who  had  a  majority  51.4%  shareholding  in  a Canadian  Uranium  exploration  and  mining  company  named  Uranium  One Inc.  (Uranium  One).  Thus,  the  respondent  opted  to  invest  in  the  Mkuju River Uranium project through Uranium One based in Canada.

Subsequently, in the wake of execution of the Scheme Implementation  Agreement  (SIA),  the  respondent entered  into  a  put/call option  agreement  with  Uranium  One,  pursuant  to  which  the  respondent sold  and  transferred  the  shares  it  had  acquired  in  Mantra  Australia  to Uranium  One  for  a  consideration  equal  to  the  respondent's  acquisition costs of  the scheme  shares.  This  was  viewed by  the appellant  as acquisition of shares by the respondent in  Mantra Australia which resulted into  acquisition  of  interest  in  Mantra's  Core  asset,  that  is,  Mkuju  River Uranium  project  located  in  Tanzania,  because  the  subsequent  sale  and transfer of the said shares to Uranium One was a  realization of interest in the  Mkuju  River  Uranium  project  by  the  respondent.  In  that  regard,  the appellant  concluded  that,  the  said  transaction  was  subject  to  taxation  in Tanzania. As such, the appellant  vide its letter with reference No. TRA/LZ/INQ/06/5549  dated  30t h   November  2011  notified  the  respondent on existence of tax liability of USD  196,000,000/= assessed on investment

income  because  the  income  earned  has  a  source  in  the  United  Republic since the transaction involved a domestic asset. In addition, on account of conveyance of the domestic asset in question, the respondent also required the  appellant to  pay Stamp  Duty which  was  assessed  at  USD  9,800,000. This is what made the respondent to lodged two appeals to the Board vide Tax Appeal Nos.26 and 27 of 2011 against the appellant herein contesting the liability to pay the taxes.

The  appeals  were  predicated  under  section  14  (2)  of  the  TRAA. Having consolidated the two appeals, in its judgment handed down on  15t h May 2013, the Board determined the consolidated Tax Appeal  No.  26 and 27  of 2011  in  favour  of the  respondent.  Aggrieved  with  the  decision  the appellant  unsuccessfully  lodged  two  appeals  to  the  Tribunal  vide  Tax Appeal  Nos.  16  and  17  of 2013,  hence the  present appeal.  However,  for reasons that will  become apparent in  due course,  we shall  not reproduce the grounds of appeal.

Both  appeals  were  confronted  with  preliminary  points  of  objection raised by the respondent through its advocates on the following grounds;

- 1.  That the  appeal  is without the  record  of appeal on  the  ground  that,  the  record  of  appeal  was

filed in Court  without  being  endorsed  by  the registrar  and  thus  contravenes  Rules  90(1)  (a) and  (b),  6,  14  and  18  of  the  Court  of  Appeal Rules 2009 as amended.

- 2.  That,  the supplementary record was filed  out of time.
- 3.  That,  supplementary  record  was  served  out  of time on the respondent.

Both  appeals  were  confronted  with  preliminary  objections  touching on  their  competency  before the  Court.  At the  hearing  the  appellant was represented  by Ms. Alicia  Mbuya,  learned  Principal  State Attorney,  Messrs. Primi Telesphori, Hospis Maswanyia, Harold Gugami and Amandus Ndayeza, learned counsel from the office of the appellant.  The respondent had  the  services  Mr.  Audax  Kahendaguza  and  Dr.  Abel  Mwiburu,  learned counsel.

Parties consented to  have the two appeals consolidated  because apart being confronted with almost  same preliminary points of objections touching on the competence of the appeals, they originate from the same appellant's letter which notified the respondent on existence of tax liability.

Thus, Appeals  No.  78 and  79 of 2018 were consolidated  into one.  In this regard,  besides,  the  preliminary  points  of  objection,  parties  were  also required  to  address  the  Court  on  the  propriety  or  otherwise  of  the respondent's action in seeking the remedy of an appeal before the Board.

In addressing the first point of objection, Mr.  Kahendaguza submitted that, the  records of the two appeals were neither signed  nor endorsed  by the  Registrar which  is  against the  dictates  of Rule  18(1)  of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules, 2009 (the Rules). Consequently,  it was argued that the infraction renders the appeal incompetent.  To support his proposition, he  cited  to  us  the  case  of sgs  societe  generale  de  survellance  sa AND  ANOTHER VS  VIPA  ENGINEERING  AND  MARKETTING  AND  ANOTHER, Civil Appeal No.  124 of 2017 (unreported) whereby on account of a similar infraction, the Court declined to invoke the overriding objective principle to salvage the irregular record of appeal and  instead  proceeded to strike out the incompetent appeal.

On the second point of objection, it was submitted that although the appellant  was  granted  leave  to  file  omitted  additional  documents,  filing those  documents  in  Mwanza  sub  Registry of the  Court without obtaining the  permission  of the  Registrar  contravened  the  provisions  of  Rule  16  of the  Rules.  In  this  regard,  it  was  argued  that,  since  the  said  additional record  is  not  properly  before  the  court  and  considering  that  leave  was already  granted  under  Rule  96  (7)  of  the  Rules,  to  file  the  omitted additional documents,  such  leave cannot be given  again  in the wake of a bar to such  recourse  in terms of Rule 97(8) of the  Rules. To  back up  his argument he referred  us to the case of puma energy Tanzania limited VS RUBY ROADWAYS (T) LIMITED, Civil Appeal No. 86 of 2015 (unreported).

Another point of preliminary objection was on the delayed service of the record of omitted  additional documents on the respondent which was effected  after the  expiry of ten  months from  the date of filing  instead  of seven days as required  under Rules 99  (2) or 97 (1) of the  Rules. He as well,  argued  that the  infraction  renders the appeal  incompetent.  Thus on account of the said lacking endorsement of the record of appeal;  irregular filing of the omitted additional documents in Mwanza Registry and delayed service  of the  such  additional  documents,  Mr.  Kahendaguza  urged  us  to strike out the appeal on account of being incompetent.

The  4t h   point  of  objection  was  on  the  variance  of  the  decree  and judgment  in  respect of Civil  Appeal  No  79  of 2018.  He  pointed  out that, while the decree bears words "each party shall bear own costs" the same is not compatible with the judgment from which the decree was extracted. In that  regard,  he  contended  that the  decree  is  defective  and  the  appeal  is not accompanied  by a  proper decree which  renders Civil Appeal  No.  79 of 2018 not competent. To bolster his proposition, he referred us to the case Of  PUMA  ENERGY TANZANIA  LIMITED  VS  RUBY  ROADWAYS  (T)  LIMITED, (supra).

In addressing the  Court  on  the propriety  or  otherwise  of  the respondent's  action  in  seeking  remedy  before  the  TRAB,  both  learned counsel for the respondent submitted that, it is not proper for the Court to raise  the  matter suo  motu and  invoke  revisional  jurisdiction  in  terms  of section 4 (3) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act CAP 141  RE.  2002 (the AJA) because one, the record is no longer before the Tribunal or the High Court and two, a similar matter faulting the jurisdiction of the Board constitutes a ground of appeal in the appeal which is not properly before the Court. To back  up  the  proposition  he  referred  us  to  the  case  of P.9219  abdon EDWARD RWEGASIRA  VS THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL, Criminal Application No. 5 of 2011 (unreported).

In  respect  of  the  propriety  or  otherwise  of  the  appeal  before  the Board  it  was  submitted  that,  respondent's  appeals  were  properly  lodged

having  been  predicated  under the provisions of section  14(2) of the TRAA and  such,  it  was  argued  that,  such  recourse  was  justified  in  terms  of section 6 of the Tanzania Revenue Authority Act (the TRA Act), in the wake of the appellant's letter dated 30/11/2011  notifying the respondent on the existence of liability of the taxes payable that is the income tax and stamp duty. Finally, the learned counsel urged the Court to sustain the preliminary points of objection and proceed to strike out the appeal.

On the other hand, Mr. Maswanyia challenged the points of preliminary objection as baseless and misconceived. He submitted that, the records of appeal are  properly before the Court as evidenced  by the date and stamp of the Court embossed on the record of appeal.  He added that, it  is  not  the  duty  of the  Registrar  to  endorse  each  and  every  document contained  in  the  record  of  appeal. He  distinguished  the  case  of SGS SOCIETE GENERALE DE SURVELLANCE SA AND ANOTHER VS VIPA engineering  and  marketting  and  another, (supra)  arguing  that,  in that case neither were the documents stamped nor signed by the Registrar which is not the case here.

In response to the preliminary point of objection on filing the omitted additional  documents  in  Mwanza  Sub  Registry of the Court,  he submitted

that, prior  to the  filing, requisite permission  was  obtained  from  the Registrar and that is why the record was transferred to the main  Registry of the Court before being cause listed for hearing. As such, he argued that, in  the  absence  of any  Rule  requiring  such  documented  permission  to  be served  on  the  respondent,  the  appellant  is  not  at  fault  and  besides,  the respondent was not prejudiced in any manner.

Mr. Maswanyia conceded on the delayed service of omitted additional documents  but  he  was  quick to  point  out  that,  the  respondent  was  not prejudiced in any manner. To bolster his propositions, he referred us to the case Of NGERENGERE ESTATE LTD Vs EDNA WILLIAM SITA Civil  Appeal  N o. 209 of 2016 (unreported). In  respect of the objection on the decree being defective, it was argued that, the decree was consistent with the judgment and thus, the appeal is properly before the Court.

On the propriety or otherwise of the appeal  before the Board, at the outset,  it was submitted that, the Court is  mandated to  raise a suo motu issue on the  legality of the  proceedings  before the  Board  regardless of a similar  matter  being  among  the  grounds  of appeal.  It was also  conceded that,  the  letter  which  was  addressed  to  the  respondent  was  indeed  a notification  of existence  of  liability  on  income  tax  and  stamp  duty  which

both  have the element of assessable tax. As such,  it was argued that the respondent's invocation of the remedy of an appeal  before the Board was irregular because while the remedy of an appeal under section 14(2) of the TRAA can be invoked where a tax dispute has no element of assessable tax dispute,  section  7A  of  the  TRAA  bars  the  Board  from  entertaining  any appeal arising from  a  complete assessment of tax without complying with the provisions of section  12 of the TRAA whereby  a person who objects to tax liability must initially lodge an objection to the CGTRA. In this regard, it was thus argued that since the  Board was not mandated to entertain the respondent's  appeals  the  Board  embarked  on  a  nullity  to  entertain  and determine  the  respondent's  appeals.  Finally,  the  learned  counsel  for  the appellant  urged  the  Court  to  invoke  revisional  powers  and  nullify  the proceedings of both the Board and the Tribunal.

In rejoinder, while Mr. Kahendaguza reiterated his earlier submissions on the incompetence of the appeals on account of the stated  infractions, Mr.  Mwiburi  maintained  that the  respondent  was justified  to  institute  an appeal before the Board considering that, the appellant's letter constituted a  notice to the  respondent on the existence of liability to  pay tax and  as such, the procedure stipulated under sections 7A and 12 of the TRAA which

obliges  one to  initially  lodge  an  objection  to the  CGTRA is  inapplicable  in the circumstances.

In determining the preliminary points of objection raised the issue for our determination is on the competency of the appeal.

It  is  glaring  that  the  record  of  appeal  was  not  endorsed  by  the Registrar as required by Rule  18 of the Rules.  In our considered view, the infraction  was  as  well  contributed  by  the  Registrar  who  ought  to  have rejected  the  record  in  terms  of  Rule  14(3)  of  the  Rules.  Thus,  in  the absence of endorsed record the appeal is rendered incompetent. Regarding the  preliminary  objection  on  filing  of  omitted  additional  documents  in Mwanza sub-registry of the Court, this does  not raise a  pure  point of law because whether or not the appellant was given a written permission to file the additional omitted documents in the Sub Registry on  Mwanza  is a fact which  has  to  be  ascertained  by  the  evidence.  We  are  fortified  in  that account in terms of the case of mukisa biscuit manufacturing co. ltd VS  west  END  d istrib u to rs   LTD  e a rl [1969]  at  page  702  where  the Court among other things said:

"A preliminary objection is in the nature of what used to be a demurrer. It raises a pure point of  law which is

argued on  assumption  that all facts pleaded by the other side are correct  It cannot be raised if any fact has to be ascertained..."

We  share  the  respondent's  concern  on  the  unreasonably  delayed service  of the  omitted  additional  documents  which  took  10  months  from the date of filing.  Since the omitted additional documents constituted  part of the record of appeal, the appellant ought to have served the record on the  respondent  not  later than  seven  days  in  terms  of  Rule  97  (1)  of the Rules.  However,  without  prejudice,  we  found  that  the  infraction  did  not occasion any injustice and it deserves to be overlooked because it does not go to root of the matter and besides, the respondent was not prejudiced in any manner.

Regarding  the  decree,  we  are  satisfied  it varies  with  the judgment from which  it was extracted  and  as such  it is defective.  On  this  account, since the decree is one of the crucial documents which must accompany an appeal  as  envisaged  under  Rule  96  (1)  (h)  of the  Rules  and  there  is  no proper  decree  accompanying  Civil  Appeal  No,  78  which  is thus  rendered incompetent.

On  account  of the  said  infractions,  normally  having  ruled  that  the appeal is incompetent we would have proceeded to strike it out.  However, in  view  of  what  will  be  unveiled  in  due  course  we  shall  refrain  from following  that  path  for  a  purpose  and  in  order to  remain  seized  with  the record of the Board and the Tribunal so as to intervene by way of revision and  rectify the  revise  illegalities  prevalent  in  the  proceedings  of both  the Tribunal  and  the  Board  otherwise  the  decisions  of  the  Board  and  the Tribunal will  remain  intact perpetuating the  illegalities. This approach was followed  by the  Court  in Tanzania  heart institute vs the  board of trustees OF NSSF, Civil Application No.  109 of 2008, chama cha walimu Tanzania vs the attorney general, Civil  Application  No.  151  of 2008 and the  d ire c to r  o f  public  prosecutions  vs  elizabeth  michael kimemeta @ lulu, Criminal Application No. 6 of 2012 (unreported)

In CHAMA CHA WALIMU TANZANIA VS ATTORNEY GENERAL (supra), the Court was confronted with an application to revise the decision of the High Court Labour Division which granted injunction to restrain a strike on the  basis  of  the  application  which  was  incompetent.  That  Labour  Court acted without jurisdiction was among the grounds in the  Notice of Motion on  which  revision  was  sought.  The  competency  of  that  application  was

challenged in a preliminary objection raised by the respondents and it was upheld by the Court.  However, the Court did not proceed to strike out the incompetent  application  as  it  is  ordinarily  the  case  because  of  a  fatal illegality patent on the face of the Labour Court record having observed:

Since the proceedings were a nullity event the order made therein including the court's ruling and final order was a  nullity. .. . Because  the proceedings before  the Labour Court were a nullity, that's why we felt constrained not to strike out this application. We did so in order to remain seized with the Labour Court's record and so be enabled to intervene suo motu to remedy the situation...."

## The Court thus concluded that:

" ....... In this particular case  we are strictly enjoined by law  to  do  what  the  learned  trial judge  in  the  Labour Court failed to do.  Failure to do so would be tantamount to perpetuating illegalities, and in particular the injunction  order  which  is  admittedly a  nullity. Acting under  s. 4(3) of  the  Act we  hereby  revised  the incompetent  proceedings in the labour Court."

The  Court  quashed  and  set  aside  all  the  orders  including  the impugned injunction granted therein.

The  Court  was  faced  with  a  similar  scenario  relating  to  an incompetent application for revision in director of public PROSECTIONS  vs.  ELIZABETH  MICHAEL  KIMEMETA  @  LULU (supra). Apart from  making a  finding that the application for revision was not competent,  the  Court  did  not  strike  out  the  application  in  order  to address  the  illegality  on  the  face  of  the  record  of  the  High  Court having Court emphasized as follows:

"So,  it is  the practice now that it is shown  that the Court  was not properly moved...  so as the  Court to exercise its powers of revision under section 4 (2) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, Cap 141 R.E  2002 hence the proceedings are incompetent but on  the face of the  record it shows  the same  to  have  been  tainted with  illegality,  the  Court  will not normally strike  out that incompetent application. Instead the Court will be taken to have called the record and proceed to revise the proceedings under section 4 (3) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, Cap 141 R.E. 2002..."

Ultimately the Court held that:

"We  did so  for  a  purpose. The purpose  is  that  we remain  seized  with  the  High  Court's  record  so  as  to enable us intervene on our own to revise the illegalities

pointed out by invoking section  4(3)  of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act CAP 141  RE.  2002,  otherwise  the High Court record will remain intact."

It is clear,  in the above cases that, the Court was confronted with a situation where the applications for revision though incompetent, emanated  from  illegal  proceedings  of  the  High  Court  and  thus,  striking them out on ground of incompetency would be tantamount to perpetuating illegalities. See  nundu  omari  rashid  vs  the  returning  o ffice r TANGA CONSTITUENCY AND TWO OTHERS, Civil Application No. 3  of 2016.

In the light of the settled  position of the  law as propounded  in case law,  the  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  raise  the  matter suo motu and  where possible  invoke  revisional  jurisdiction  to  correct  anomalies  in  decisions  of the courts below or tribunals in order to avert perpetuating illegalities. The jurisdiction of this Court to invoke revisional jurisdiction on the decisions of the Tribunal is embedded in both the Appellate Jurisdiction Act and the Tax Revenue Appeals Act whereby section 25 (1) and (2) stipulate as follows:

"(1)  Any  person who is aggrieved  by the decision of the  Tribunal may preferred an  appeal  to the Court of  Appeal.

(2) Appeal to the Court of  Appeal  shall  He on matters involving questions of law only and the provisions of the Appellate Jurisdiction  Act  *  and  the  rules  made thereunder shall apply mutatis mutandis to appeals  from  the  decision  of  the Tribunal."

While subsection  (1)  improvises on  the  right of appeal  to the  Court on purely questions of law against the decisions of the Tribunal, the bolded expression  under subsection (2) brings into play the application of section 4 (2) and (3) of the AD A, which clothe the Court with revisional jurisdiction in relation to Tribunal's decisions. In this regard, we have read the decision in the  case of P.2919 abdon  edward  rwegasira  vs  the  judge advocate  general (supra)  which  was  cited  to  us  by  the  respondent's counsel. With  respect, apart from the case being cited out of context,  it is distinguishable  with  the  case  at  hand.  We  are  fortified  in  that  account because,  in  the  said  case  the  issue  determined  by  the  Court  was to  the effect that, since the Court Martial Appeals court is not part of the structure of the High Court as defined under section 3 of the AJA and article 108 (1) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania,  1977, the Court has

no jurisdiction to revise the proceedings of the Court Martial Appeals Court unless the respective laws are amended.

Before  determining  the  issue  of  the  propriety  or  otherwise  of  the respondent's  appeal  before  the  Board,  we  have  deemed  it  pertinent  to revisit the tax disputes resolving mechanism as articulated under the TRAA and the Stamp  Duty Act CAP  189  R.E  2002.  Under  Part III  of the TRAA, section 12  regulates  the  manner  in  which  a  person  who  disputes  an assessment made  upon  him  by the Commissioner-General  may,  to object to  the  assessment  by  lodging  a  notice  in  writing  to  the  CommissionerGeneral.  After the  notice  of objection  is given,  the  person  objecting  shall pay the amount of tax which is not in dispute or deemed  by not to be in dispute, or pay one third of the assessed tax, whichever is greater, pending the final determination of the assessment.  However,  under subsection (3), the Commissioner-General may allow the person objecting the assessment to pay lesser amount as is reasonable in the circumstances, or not to pay tax until the assessment or liability to pay tax is final  where the CGTRA is of the opinion that, owing to uncertainty as to any question of law or fact; or considerations of hardship or equity; or impossibility, or undue difficulty or  expense,  of  recovery  of  tax,  the  person  objecting  the  assessment  is

unable  to  pay  the  tax  due  and payable  by  him.  After  the  CGTRA's determination of the objection,  if a tax payer is aggrieved,  he may appeal to  the  Board  within  the  prescribed  period  in  terms  of  the  provisions  of section  16 of the TRAA.  Moreover,  while section  7 of the TRAA vests the Board  with  sole  original  jurisdiction  in  all  proceedings  of  civil  nature  in respect of disputes arising from revenue laws administered by the Tanzania Revenue  Authority,  section  7A  of the  TRAA  limits  the jurisdiction  of the Board in the following manner as it stipulates:

"The  Board shall not entertain  any appeal arising from tax assessment unless section 12 of this Act is complied with . "

This position was subsequent of the amendment of the TRAA vide Finance Act No.  16 of 2007. The assessment is defined under section 3 of the TRAA as follows:

" assessment " means  an  assessment  of  tax  as determined or ascertained in each of the respective tax law.

Since the matter before us is on a dispute involving  income tax and stamp  duty,  it  is  crucial  to  understand  the  meaning  and  the  manner  in

which  the  assessment  is  regulated.  Under  the  ITA,  2004,  assessment  is defined as follows:

"assessment" means and assessment under sections 9495, 96 or 103".

What is of relevance in the particular case at hand is section 96 (1) of the ITA, 2004 which stipulates as follows:

"Subject  to  this  section, the  Commissioner  may adjust an assessment made under section 94, 95 or this section so as to adjust the person's liability to pay tax,  including any tax payable on assessment, in such manner as, according to the Commissioner's best judgment and information reasonably available,  shall be  consistent  with  the intention  of the Act."

In the light of what we have stated above,  in a  nutshell, assessment entails the  process of determining  tax  liability whereas  the  issuing  of the respective notice is to enable the taxpayer to  know the tax  liability. Thus, in  the  case  at  hand,  the  letter  authored  by  the  appellant  notifying  the respondent on the adjusted  assessment in  terms of section  96  (1)  of the

ITA, was a clear notice of existence of liability on capital gain on the part of the respondent.

Furthermore,  among the taxes disputed  by the  respondent is stamp duty  which  is  governed  under  the  Stamp  Duty  Act  CAP  189  RE.  2002. According  to the  provisions  of section  43  (1)  and  (2)  of the  Stamp  Duty Act,  a  person  who  is  in  doubt  as  to  whether  or  not  an  instrument  is required  to  be  stamped or  as  to  the  amount  of the  stamp  duty payable in respect of any instrument, may apply for an  adjudication by a Stamp Duty Officer. The officer may require to be furnished with an abstract of the instrument,  and  also with  such  affidavit or other evidence necessary to prove that all facts and circumstances affecting the chargeability of the instrument with duty, or the amount of duty with which it is chargeable, are fully and truly set forth therein. Under section 43(3) of the Act the decision of the stamp duty officer may be appealed against to the  Commissioners  of  stamp  duty  whose  decision  on  appeal  shall  be subject to  reference to the  Board.  The  decision  of the  Board  is final  and binds the stamp duty officer and the parties to the instruments.

In determining the propriety or otherwise of the respondent's appeal before the  Board which  is a  subject of the  matter  before  us,  we  shall  be

guided by the stated position of the law regulating the manner of resolving the  tax  related  disputes and  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Board  and  the Tribunal in entertaining the appeals relating to tax disputes.

It is not in dispute that after the respondent received the Commissioner's letter dated  30/11/2012 which  notified  it on the existence of  liability  to  pay  income  tax  on  capital  gain  and  stamp  duty,  lodged  an appeal before the Board. Parties locked horns on the propriety or otherwise of the appeal lodged under the provisions of section 14(2) of the TRAA.

In relation to the income tax liability on capital gain,  it is clear that if a person  is  notified  of  the  tax  liability,  if  aggrieved, has  to  lodge  an objection  to the  CGTRA as  prescribed  under section  12  of the TRAA. The CGTRA  is  obliged  to  make  a  determination  which  is  appealable  to  the Board. The circumstances in which one may seek remedy of an appeal to the  Board  against other decisions of the Commissioner General are stated under the provisions of section 14 (1) and (2) which stipulate as follows:

" ( 1)  Any  person aggrieved  by-

- fa) the calculation by the Commissioner-

General of the amount due for refund, drawback  or  repayment  of  any  tax, duty, levy or charge;

- (b) a refusal by the Commissioner-General to make any refund or repayment; or
- (c) an apportionment of  any amount or sum by the Commissioner-General under the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act which affects, or may affect,  the liability to tax of  two or more persons; or
- (d) a  determination  by  the  CommissionerGeneral under paragraph  32(4)  of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax  Act;
- (e) the decision by the CommissionerGeneral to register, or refusal to register,  any trader for the purpose  of the  Value Added  Tax Act,  may appeal therefrom to the Board.
- Notwithstanding subsection (2), a person who objects a notice issued by the CommissionerGeneral  with  regards  to the  existence  of liability  to  pay  any  tax,  duty,  fees,  levy  or charge may refer his objection  to  the Board for determination.

It is glaring that, subsection (1) limits the circumstances in which one may seek redress by way of an appeal to the board against the decision of the  Commissioner.  Under  subsection (2 ),  a   person  who  objects  a   notice issued  by  the  Commissioner-General  with  regards  to  the  existence  of liability to pay  any  tax, duty, fees, levy or  charge may  refer  his objection to  the  Board  for  determination.  Thus,  the  remedy  on  the objected notice before the Board is by way of reference and not an appeal as suggested by Dr. Mwiburi.

In the case at hand, since the appellant's letter in question constituted notice  on  existence  of  liability  to pay  income  tax  to  the respondent,  it was  illegal  to  seek  remedy  of an  appeal  before  the  Board which  is statutorily barred to entertain appeals relating to tax assessment under the provisions of section  7  A of the TRAA. Therefore, the Board  had no jurisdiction  and  it embarked  on  a  nullity to  entertain  the  respondent's appeals. Similarly, it was illegal for the Board to entertain the respondent's appeal on stamp  duty  because  the respective tax dispute resolving mechanism  initially  requires  the  dispute  to  be  adjudicated  by  the  Stamp Duty Officer and the appeal therefrom lies to the Commissioner and finally a  reference  may  be  made to the  Board.  Thus,  as  it was the case on the

income tax dispute, the Board illegally entertained the respondent's appeal on  stamp  duty  and  what  ensued  thereafter  is  indeed  a  nullity.  We  are fortified in that account because jurisdiction is a creature of statute and as such,  it  cannot  be  assumed  or  exercised  on  the  basis  of  the  likes  and dislikes of the parties. That is why the Court has in a number of occasions insisted that, the question of jurisdiction is fundamental in court proceedings and can be raised at any stage even at the appeal stage. The court, suo  motu can  raise  it  in  adjudication  the  initial  question  to  be determined  is whether or not the court or tribunal  is vested with  requisite jurisdiction. See -richard ju liu s rukambura vs issack ntwa mwakajila and another, Civil  Application  No  3  of  2004  (unreported). Prior to that, this Court in fanuel m antiri NG'UNDA vs Herman mantiri NG'UNDA &amp; 20 others, (CAT) Civil Appeal No. 8 of 1995 (unreported) had held thus:-

"The question of  jurisdiction for any court is basic, it goes to the very root of  the authority of  the court to adjudicate  upon  cases of different nature  ..  (T)he question of  jurisdiction is so fundamental that courts must as a matter of  practice on the face of it be certain and assured of their jurisdictional position at the commencement of the trial....

It is risky and unsafe for the court to proceed with the trial of  a case on the assumption that the court has  jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the case."

## [Emphasis supplied.]

What was said  in the above decisions  in  respect of a trial  court on the  issue  in  question  applies  with  equal  force  to  an  appellate  Board  and Tribunal considering that, before an appeal is determined on the merits on issues  not touching  on  the jurisdiction(s)  of the  court  (s)  below,  it  must first be  certain  that  the proceedings  giving rise to  the  appeal  were competently before that court or those courts. This is because a judgement in an appeal from proceedings which were a nullity is also a nullity.

On the way forward, we invoke our revisional jurisdiction  under the provisions  of  section  4  (3)  of  the  AJA  to  nullify  the  proceedings  and judgments of the Board and the Tribunal because the first appeal stemmed from null proceedings. That is why we felt constrained not to strike out this appeal  in  order  to  remain  seized  with  the  record  and  so  be  enabled  to intervene suo  motu to remedy  the  situation and not  to perpetuate illegalities.  We  further  direct the  respondent  to  comply  with  the  law  if  it wishes to pursue an objection against tax assessment before the appellant

by  channeling  the  same  to  the  CGTRA.  Considering  the  nature  of  the matter, we make no order as to costs.
