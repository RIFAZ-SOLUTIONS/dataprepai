Dated the 15th  day of October, 2011 in VAT Appeal  No. 13  of 2010

## RULING OF THE COURT

The application, which was brought under Rules 96(6) and 4(2)(a) and (b) of the Tanzania  Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009  (the  Rules),  is  supported  by the affidavit of Sylivastus Sylivanus Mayenga, advocate.

At the  hearing  on  25/6/2018,  the  applicant  was  represented  by  Mr. Sylivanus Mayenga, learned counsel whereas the respondent, The Commissioner  General  (TRA),  was  represented  by  Mr.  Harold  Gugami, learned  counsel. The  respondent  did  not  file  an  affidavit  in  reply  and therefore,  the  application  stood  unopposed. In  the  circumstances,  Mr. Mayenga  urged  the  Court to  grant the  prayer  on  account of the  reasons advanced in the notice of motion and the supporting affidavit.

Mr. Gugami  did not resist the application. He  stated that  the respondent did  not, from the beginning, object to the application  in which the applicant was granted extension of time to file the present application.

From the  record, the application  arises from  Civil  Appeal  No.  250  of 2017. In  that  appeal,  the  applicant appealed  against the  decision  of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal in VAT Appeal  No.  13 of 2010. Having filed the  said  appeal  in  this  Court,  it  realized  that  the  documents  which  are

sought to  be  included  in  the  record  of the  appeal  were  omitted  from  the record.

Under  Rule  96(6)  of  the  Rules,  the  applicant  had  the  liberty  of including the  omitted documents  in  the  record of  the appeal  within fourteen  days  from  the  date  of  filing  the  appeal.  Within  that  period,  an appellant  does  not  require  the  leave  of the  Court. It  is  imperative  from that  provision  that after expiry of the  prescribed  period  of fourteen  days, the documents can only be included after obtaining the leave of the Court. For this  reason,  the  applicant  applied  for  extension  of time  through  Civil Application No. 40/20 of 2018. That application was granted on 23/4/2018, and consequently, the application at hand was filed.

Before  we  proceeded  to  determine  the  application,  we  found  it apposite  to  consider  the  nature  of  the  application  as  presented  by  the applicant. Firstly,  as stated above, the applicant is seeking to be granted leave  to  file  supplementary  record  consisting  of the  omitted  documents. Secondly,  in the title of the  notice of motion  and the affidavit,  it is shown that the  application  is "for leave to amend the Record and Memorandum

o f Appeal  in  an  appeal  against  the  Judgment  and  Decree  o f the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal at Dar es Salaam

When Mr. Mayenga was  asked to clarify on that mix-up, he conceded  that, because  what  is sought  is inclusion of  the omitted documents, the process does not amount to amendment of the record.  In our view, that  is  a  correct  position  because  under  Rule  111  of the  Rules which vests the Court  with the powers  of  ordering amendment  of documents, the amendment envisaged in that Rule involves the documents  such  as;  a  notice  of  appeal,  memorandum  of  appeal  or  a notice  of  cross-appeal  which  are  contained  in  an  already  filed  record  of appeal. The  provision  does  not  allow  for  introduction  of the  documents which were not in the record at the time of filing the appeal.

With regard to the issue whether inclusion of the omitted documents can be made by way of filing a supplementary record, the learned counsel for  the  applicant  argued  that  it  is  proper  to  do  so. He  relied  on  the provisions  under which the Court has been  moved. On the basis of what we have earlier stated  above,  we agree that the Court has been  properly moved  under  Rule  96(6)  of the  Rules. However,  since  the  documents

which,  by virtue of the  provisions of Rule 96(1)  of the  Rules are essential to the appeal, the same cannot be filed through a supplementary record of appeal.

The position was clearly stated in the case of Haruna Mpangaos &amp; 902 Others v. Tanzania Portland Cement Co. Ltd, Civil Appeal No.  10 of  2007  (unreported). In that  case, the  Court  had  the  occasion  of interpreting the provisions of Rules 89(1) and 92(1) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 1979 (now Rules 96(1) and 99(1) of the Rules respectively). The court stated as follows:-

" ....a supplementary record o f  appeal  presupposes the existence o f  a complete record o f  appeal lodged by an appellant. Complete in  the sense  that it contains all the  essential  documents  itemized  under  Rule  89(1). Under  Rule  92(1)  the  use  o f the  words  containing copies o f  any further documents or additional parts o f documents  which are,  in his opinion required for the proper determination  o f the  appeal' mean,  in  effect, that  the  supplementary  record  o f  appeal  may  be lodged for the purpose o f making good deficiencies in the record o f appeal not affecting the competence o f the appeal. A supplementary record o f  appeal should,

## therefore,  add something  to  the  otherwise  complete record o f  appeal."

On  the basis  of  the above  stated position, inclusion of  the  omitted documents cannot be  made through  a  supplementary  record. The same are  to  be  lodged  and  served  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  of  filing documents after institution of an appeal.

That having been said, we  hereby  grant  the application. The applicant is granted  leave to  include the  omitted  documents  in  the  record of appeal. It  has to do so within  14 days from the date of delivery of this ruling.

Each party shall bear its own costs.

DATED at DODOMA this 27th  day of June, 2018.
