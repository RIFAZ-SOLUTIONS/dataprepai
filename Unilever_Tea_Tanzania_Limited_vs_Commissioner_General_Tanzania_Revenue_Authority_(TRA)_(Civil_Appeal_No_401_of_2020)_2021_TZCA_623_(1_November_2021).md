## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

26t h  October &amp; 1 s t November, 2021

## NDIKA, J.A.:

The appellant, Unilever Tea Tanzania Limited, challenges the judgment of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") dated 12t h  August, 2020 in Tax Appeal No. 36 of 2018 partly affirming the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board ("the Board") in Consolidated Income Tax Appeals Nos. 22, 23 and 24 of 2014.

We begin with the facts of the case as succinctly summarized  by the Tribunal. The appellant is a company incorporated  in Tanzania, engaged  in agricultural tea growing and production in Mufindi, Iringa. On diverse dates,

the appellant lodged  her income tax  returns for the years of income 2008, 2009 and  2010.  Sometime in  2010, the  respondent conducted  an  audit on the appellant's tax affairs to ascertain her tax compliance. The audit covered, among others, corporate tax for the respective years, which ended  up with the  respondent  issuing  notices  of  adjusted  assessments  for  the  aforesaid years of income.

Resenting the assessments, the appellant duly filed notices of objection for the respective years of income alleging that the respondent had wrongly disallowed certain costs incurred wholly and exclusively for the production of her  income.  It  was  further  alleged  that the  assessments  did  not  consider actual  provisional  tax  paid  and  withholding  tax  remittance  made  by  the appellant.  In  response to the objections and after several  correspondences and meetings between the parties, the respondent issued amended assessments  portraying  a  downward  change  in  the  amounts  assessed.  In particular, the respondent disallowed 50% of the management entertainment cost and rejected the appellant's claim that there was a double disallowance of the expense.

Still dissatisfied, the appellant lodged Income Tax Appeals Nos. 22, 23 and  24  of  2014  in  the  Board,  which  were  consolidated  and  determined conjointly. In its decision dated 28t h  June, 2018, the Board partly allowed the

appeals.  With  regard  to  management entertainment cost,  the  Board  ruled that the appellant failed to prove the alleged double disallowance reasoning that  she  did  not  present  to  the  Board  the  respondent's  computations  to substantiate her claim.

Still aggrieved, the appellant appealed to the Tribunal on four grounds. As hinted earlier, the Tribunal partly allowed the appeal as it determined the first two grounds in the appellant's favour.  In that regard, the Tribunal held that the Board erred in law in dealing with and determining a new issue raised by the respondent in the course of submissions but was not one of the issues framed for trial without hearing the appellant on it. The issue was whether certain expenditure items were wholly and exclusively used in the production of the appellant's income. In consequence, the Tribunal vacated the Board's finding  against the appellant on that issue and ordered that the  matter be remitted  to  the  Board  for  it  to  hear  both  parties  and  determine  the  issue accordingly. So far as the other two grounds were concerned, the appeal was dismissed.  Specifically  on  management  entertainment  cost,  the  Tribunal upheld the Board's finding that the appellant failed to demonstrate how the respondent computed allowable expenditure items improperly.

The  appeal  is  predicated  on  two  grounds  questioning  the  Tribunal's appreciation and examination of the evidence on record as follows:

- 1. That, on the evidence adduced before the Board, the Tribunal erred in iaw and in fact in holding that the Board was correct to hold that the appellant failed to prove double taxation/double adding back of the management fee.
- 2.  That, the Tribunal erred  in fact  and  law  by  holding that the appellant failed to demonstrate on how the respondent improperly computed the  allowable  expenditure  because  the  appellant  ought  to  have submitted computations from both parties.

At the  hearing  of the  appeal,  Mr.  Alan  Nlawi  Kileo,  learned  counsel, teamed up with Messrs. Wilson Kamugisha Mukebezi and Stephen Axwesso, learned  advocates,  to  represent  the  appellant.  The  respondent  had  the services of Ms. Gloria Achimpota and Mr. Harold Gugami, learned Senior State Attorneys.

Addressing  us on  behalf of the appellant,  Mr.  Kileo fully adopted the written submissions lodged in support of the appeal proposing one main issue for determination: whether the Tribunal properly examined the evidence on record in holding that the Board was correct to find that the appellant failed to prove double taxation/disallowance of  the management entertainment cost and  to  demonstrate  how  the  respondent  improperly  computed  allowable expenditure.

It was the appellant's contention that the Tribunal's examination of the evidence  on  record  was  erroneous  and  the  conclusion  it  reached  equally erroneous. Referring to the appellant's income tax returns and accompanying computations (Exhibit A-l), at pages 158 through 197 of the record of appeal, counsel submitted that the appellant had disallowed 50% of the management entertainment cost but the  respondent further disallowed  50%  of the cost despite agreeing that such cost was partly incurred for business purposes. It was, therefore, argued that the respondent's decision to disallow 50% of the management entertainment cost which had already been disallowed by 50% by the appellant amounted to double disallowance.

The  appellant's  counsel  also  made  reference  to  the  respondent's proposals  on  management  entertainment  cost  and  proposal  to  settle  the objections (Exhibits A-4,  A-5  and  A-7).  It was strongly contended  that the said  evidence  pointed  out that despite the  respondent acknowledging  that the appellant added back/disallowed 50% of the management entertainment cost, the respondent still disallowed 50% of the management entertainment cost, resulting in double disallowance which the Tribunal failed to appreciate. Moreover,  it  was  argued  that  the  respondent's  tax  computations  were unnecessary to prove double disallowance whereas Exhibit A-7 (letters from the respondent to the appellant on the final determination of the objections)

clearly  showed  that  the  respondent  disallowed  50%  of  the  management entertainment cost despite the  undisputed  fact that the same amount had been added back/disallowed by the appellant in her tax computations.

The Tribunal was also faulted for endorsing the Board's finding that the appellant  failed  to  demonstrate  that the  respondent  improperly  computed allowable expenditure by failing to produce before the Board the respondent's computations.  The  contention  was  that  the law  does not  oblige  the respondent  to  issue  its  computation  after  the  final  determination.  That notwithstanding, it was claimed, the appellant demonstrated on the evidence on  record that the respondent improperly computed allowable expenditure. In  conclusion, the Court was urged, on the authority of Deemay Daati &amp; Two Others v. Republic, Criminal Appeal No. 80 of 1994 (unreported), to re-appraise the evidence on  record  in view of the alleged  misapprehension by  the  Tribunal  of  the  substance,  nature  and  quality  of  the  evidence. Accordingly, the learned counsel implored us to allow the appeal with costs.

In  rebuttal,  Ms.  Achimpota argued,  based on the written submissions filed  in  opposition  to  the  appeal,  that  the  grounds  of appeal  raise  mainly matters of fact, which the Court is precluded from dealing with by section 25 (2) of the TRAA.

It was Ms. Achimpota's contention that the appellant had the onus to prove, in terms of section  18 (2) (b) of the TRAA as interpreted in Insignia Limited v. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  14  of  2007  (unreported),  that the  impugned  assessment  was excessive or erroneous. She supported the concurrent findings of the Board and  the  Tribunal  on  the  ground  that  the  appellant  failed  to  provide  the respondent's tax computations as evidence to substantiate the alleged double taxation/disallowance of the management fee and improper computation of the allowable expenditure. It was her further argument that Exhibit A-l was not  sufficient  and  that  the  absence  of the  respondent's  tax  computations rendered the appellant's claims of double taxation of management entertainment cost and improper computation of allowable expenditure mere speculations.

As  regards  the  substance  and  totality  of  Exhibits  A-l  to  A-7,  it  was contended that the exhibits did  not prove the appellant's claims. While A-l constituted the appellant's income tax returns and computations, Exhibits A4, A-5 and A-7 could not resolve the dispute in the appellant's favour. On this basis,  she  urged  us to  reject the claim that the Tribunal's  misapprehended the  evidence on  record  and  proceed  to  uphold  its findings.  Moreover,  she submitted  that Deemay Daati {supra), relied  upon  by the  appellant,  was inapplicable to the appeal at hand as no misapprehension of the substance, nature and quality of the evidence on  record  by the Tribunal  is discernible. Accordingly, the learned Senior State Attorney urged us to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In a brief rejoinder, Mr. Kileo referred us, once again, to Exhibit A-l, at page 231  of the  record  of appeal, that it was clear that the appellant had disallowed 50% of the management entertainment cost and that this strand of evidence served as sufficient proof.  He made further reference to Exhibit A-7,  which was the final determination  by the  respondent,  showing a  50% disallowance of the management entertainment cost.  He reiterated that the failure to attach the respondent's computations was inconsequential.

We have examined the record of appeal and considered the oral and written submissions for and against the appeal. At the outset, we agree with the parties that the crisp issue for our determination is whether the Tribunal properly  examined  the  evidence  on  record  in  holding  that the  Board  was correct  to  find that  the appellant  failed to prove  the  alleged double taxation/disallowance of the management  entertainment  cost  and to demonstrate how the respondent improperly computed allowable expenditure.

To be resolved first is the disagreement between the learned counsel whether the appeal is purely predicated on  matters of fact in contravention of section  25  (2) of the TRAA, which enacts that the right of appeal to the Court from the decision of the Tribunal  lies on "matters involving questions of  law  only/'  In Atlas  Copco  Tanzania  Limited  v.  Commissioner General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  167  of  2019 (unreported), the Court defined the phrase "question of law" for the purpose of section 25 (2) of the TRAA, to include:

"first, an issue on the interpretation of  a provision of the  Constitution , a statute,  subsidiary legislation  or any  legal  doctrine  on  tax  revenue  administration. Secondly a  question  on  the  application  by  the Tribunal of  a provision of  the Constitution, a statute, subsidiary  legislation  or  any  legal  doctrine  to  the evidence on record. Finally, a question on a conclusion arrived  at by the Tribunal where there is failure to evaluate the evidence or  if  there is no evidence to support it or that it is so perverse or so illegal that no reasonable tribunal would arrive at it. "[Emphasis added]

See also Insignia Limited {supra)) and Kilombero Sugar Company Ltd. v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 261 of 2018 (both unreported).

As hinted earlier, the appellant's complaint in the two grounds of appeal is  that  the  Tribunal's  decision  was  based  on  a  misapprehension  of  the evidence on  record on the disallowance of the  management entertainment cost  and  computation  of  allowable  expenditure.  Guided  by Atlas  Copco {supra), we  are  satisfied  that  the  two  grounds  raise  a  question  of  law deserving the Court's attention and consideration.

The contest between the parties herein centres on the Tribunal's finding in  its judgment, at page 317 of the record of appeal, after it had examined Exhibits A-l, A-4, A-5 and A-7. The conclusion reads thus:

"We  have  carefully  analysed  the  exhibits  quoted above but we have not been able to see how they prove  that  there was  double  addition. In  those documents  or  exhibits the respondent  kept  on insisting that the disallowed 50% while the appellant kept  on insisting that  50% had  already  been disallowed in 2008.  We are,  therefore, satisfied that the appellant failed to prove that there  was double taxation/double adding back of  the management fee. Issues  (Hi)  and (iv)  are  therefore  answered in  the affirmative."

The Tribunal  came to the above conclusion  after it  had  rejected  the appellant's argument that the  Board  should  have invoked  its powers under

section  17  (2)  of the TRAA and  Rule  16  (10)  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Board  Rules,  2018 to call for the production of the respondent's calculation sheet in order for it to examine if the alleged double addition was proven. It was maintained that the appellant had the onus of establishing its case before the Board and that it was not the duty of the Board to assist her in doing so.

On  our  part,  we  examined  the  record  of appeal  and  paid  particular attention to Exhibits A-l, A-4, A-5 and A-7. It is evident that Exhibit A-l, at pages  172,  173,  182,  184  and  185  of the  record  of  appeal,  shows  50% disallowances of the management entertainment cost made by the appellant for the year of income  2008.  We  also examined  Exhibit P.7,  at pages  231 through 236. We noted, for instance, from the respondent's letter, at page 231  of the  record,  that the  management entertainment cost amounting  to TZS.  34,163,080.00  for the  year of income  2008  was  disallowed  by  50%, which translated into TZS.  17,081,540.00. The letter states further that the determination of the appellant's objection "was based  on the attached  income tax  computation." We  wonder  why  the  appellant  did  not  produce  the computations to rationalize its claim of double taxation as well as improper computation  of allowable  expenditure.  Under the circumstances,  we  share the Tribunal's  view  that the  claimed  double  taxation  could  not  be  proven before the Board without it having the benefit of examining the respondent's

tax computations rationalizing the disallowances. As held  by the Board and the Tribunal and submitted by Ms. Achimpota, the appellant had the onus to establish  its  case  and  that  she  ought to  have  produced  the  aforesaid  tax computations.  In  the  premises,  we  are  unpersuaded  that  the  Tribunal misapprehended the evidence on record on the alleged improper computation of allowable expenditure. The two grounds of appeal fail.

In fine, we hold that the appeal is unmerited. We dismiss it with costs.
