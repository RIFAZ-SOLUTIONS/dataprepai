## JUDGMENT  OF THE COURT

27 th June &amp; 9 th July, 201 8

## JUMA, C.J.:

The appellant  NATIONAL BANK OF COMMERCE  is a financial institut ion engaged  in banking  business in Tanzania,  and for  purposes of  this appeal this  bank  is  an  income  tax  payer.  The  respondent,  THE  COMMISSIONER GENERAL is the Chief  Executive Officer of the Tanzania Revenue Authority, a  body  corporate  established  under  section  4  of  the  Tanzania  Revenue Authority Act (Cap  399)  for  purposes  of  assessment  and  collection  of revenues.  For  purposes  of  this  appeal  the  respondent is  charged  with

administration of the  Income  Tax  Act,  2004  (hereinafter referred  to  as "the ITA,  2004").

The  appellant  was  assessed, by  way  of  Notices  of  Assessment  Nos. F42015050544, F420150547 and  F420150227, to  pay income tax  of Tshs. 4,749,673,077.00 for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. Aggrieved with  the  assessment of  tax  for  those three  years of  income, the appellant  invoked  section  12(1)  of Tax  Revenue Appeals Act  (Cap 408)  to object  to  the respondent's  decision  to  treat the  appellant's  impairment provisions as non-tax-deductible. This treatment, according to the appellant,  was  based on  the  respondent's  narrow  interpretation of  section 25 of the ITA,  2004.

The objections  were  to  no avail,  because the  respondent  stuck  to  the assessment which  prompted  the  appellant  to  lodge  three  Appeals  to  the Tax  Revenue Appeals  Board at  Dar es Salaam (hereinafter referred  to  as "the  Board") in  Income  Tax  Appeal  Case DSM Nos.  38,  39  and  40  of 2012.  These  appeals  to  the  Board were  later  consolidated  into  one  Tax Appeal No. 38 of  2012.

At  the Board  the  Appellant  complained  against  the  decision  of  the respondent  to  refuse  to  deduct  the  provision  for impairment  of  its  bad

debts arising from  the  assessment of the  years of  income 2005,  2006 and 2007. According to the  appellant,  the  respondent  had wrongly  rejected the deductibility  of  bad  debts  which  the  appellant  believed  warranted  to  be written off. And in so far  as the  appellant  is concerned, the  deductions are allowable under the  financial  laws as prescribed by the Bank of Tanzania. And  by  disallowing the deduction, the appellant contended that the respondent  has misinterpreted  the  provisions of  section  25(5)  of  the  ITA, 2004.

The parties at the  Board raised three  main issues for  determination  by the  Board: first, whether  the  making of  provisions for  impairment  of  bad debts  and  doubtful debts  is  permissible  under  the  law,  and  whether  it qualifies  for deductions under  the Income  Tax  Act,  2004 ("the ITA, 2004"). Second, whether the making  of provisions for reserves  is permissible under the  law;  and third, whether  the  Board is bound  by the decision of  the  Tribunal  in Barclays  Bank  Tanzania v  Commissioner General, Income Tax Appeal No. 3 of 2011.

Hearing  at the Board  was by way of written submissions.  On appellant's  behalf  it  was  submitted  in  the  Board that  the  appellant  had earlier reported  its bad debts after  they  had been written  off  in accordance

with  the  Banking  and  Financial Institutions Act,  2006  (Cap 42)  and  the Banking and Financial Institutions (Management of Risk Assets) Regulations, 2008  (GN  No.  374/2008). It was  also  pointed  out  that  the appellant  complied with the applicable  accounting principles whereby during  every  accounting period,  existence  or  otherwise  of doubtful or impaired debts are first established, and if impairment exists, the impairment that  is established is charged to the account.

On the respondent's behalf, it was submitted  before the  Board that  for income tax purposes, a person can only enjoy a deduction on losses arising from  debt  claims,  when  the  debt  has  been  actualized  and  for  financial institution,  that  debt  must  have been both  realized in terms  of  section  39 of the  ITA,  2004,  and also written  off  after all recovery mechanisms have failed.  It  was argued  that  the  deduction  which  the  appellant  was seeking had  not  been  realized  in  accordance with  Section  39  of  the  ITA,  2004. Those doubtful  debts  are  mere estimates or  probable  loss which  may be recovered if  proper  measures are  put  in  place for  their  recovery.  It  was further  submitted  that  the  appellant  neither  provided  the  list  of  accounts which were written  off  nor evidence to prove that  they were  uncollectible.

After  hearing the opposing submissions, the  Board made a finding  that the provisions for impairment of bad debts and doubtful debts is permissible under the  law,  but  only  when  the  debts  have been actualized and  all  debt  have  been  realized as well  as written  off  from  the  books of account after  all  recovery  mechanisms have failed.  The  Board further  held that  section 25(a)  and  (b)  of the  ITA,  2004  provides two  conditions  before a tax  payer can qualify  for  deduction  of  bad debts. The  Board went  on to note that  the appellant,  being a financial institution,  its bad debt  must be in accordance with  guidelines  issued  by  the  Bank  of  Tanzania  (BOT).  The Board further  observed  that,  to  compute  the  income  that  is  taxable,  the business losses  which the taxpayer incurred are to deductible in accordance with  section  11 of  the  ITA,  2004  read together  with  sections 18, and 39(d)  of  the  ITA,  2004. The  Board also highlighted  the  burden of proof  which  section  18(2)(b)  of  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals  Act,  Cap 408 places on the  appellant  tax  payer to  prove that  the  bad debt  or  loss, over which  deduction  is sought,  had been  realized in  accordance with  sections 18 and 39 of the ITA, 2004. Accordingly the  Board dismissed the appeal.

Aggrieved  with  the  decision of  the  Board, the  appellant  appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  at  Dar es Salaam in Tax Appeal No. 23

of  2015 (hereinafter  referred  to  as "the  Tribunal"). The  appellant  relied on the following  four  grounds:

- 1.-That the Honourable Board erred in law  when it  held that  making  of  provisions  for  impairment  of  bad  and doubtful  debts is permissible under  the  law  only  when the debts have been actualized and all  debt have been realized and written off from the books of accounts after all recovery mechanisms  have failed.
- 2. -The Honourable Board erred in law when it held that making of provisions for reserve is not permissible under the Income  Tax  Act, 2004.
- 3. -The Honourable Board erred in law and fact  when it held  that the  Appellant  failed  to  substantiate  in the balance of probability  how  the provisions for  regulatory reserves  qualify  for  deduction  under  the  Income Tax Act, 2004.
- 4. -The Honourable Board erred in law  when it  failed to determine the case  before it on its own merits.

The  main  issue  agreed  upon  for  the  determination by  the  Tribunal was,  whether it is necessary  for impairment of losses  to qualify for deduction, the  bank must write them off.

In  its decision, dismissing the appeal, the Tribunal determined  that the appellant  had not  shown that  its debt  had been written  off  from  its books of  accounts, which  is one of the  two  conditions  before the  appellant  could rely on section 25(5)  of the  ITA,  2004. In  a nutshell, the Tribunal  held that the appellant could not rely on the deductions.

Still  determined, the  appellant  brought  this  appeal  to  this  Court  on three  grounds. Standing out  is the  ground faulting  the  Tribunal  for  holding that  the Appellant could not have qualified for deduction because it has not shown that the debt  had been written  off from  its books of accounts.

When the appeal came up for  hearing three  learned counsel, Mr. Allan Kileo,  Mr.  Wilson  Mukebezi  and  Ms.  Salome  Gondwe  appeared  for  the Appellant.  Mr.  Juma  Salum  Beleko,  learned  advocate,  appeared  for  the Respondent.

Mr. Mukebezi premised his submissions by explaining  why  he thought the  Tribunal  was  wrong  to  rely on  the  provisions of  section  39(  d)  of  ITA, 2004 to conclude that  realization of a debt  by a financial  institution  like the appellant  is  predicated  on  two  conditions.  First condition  is that  the  debt must  have  become  a  bad  debt  in  accordance with  standards  set  by  the Bank  of Tanzania (BoT). The second  condition is that the financial

institution  concerned  must  have written  off  the  debt  as bad. And that  the appellant had not shown that  the debt had been written  off from  its books.

Beginning from  section 21 (1)  of the  ITA,  2004, the  learned advocate for  the  appellant  demonstrated  why  he  thinks  the  Tribunal  erred.  This provision,  he  submitted,  oblige  taxpayers  to  account  for  their  income  in accordance with  generally  accepted accounting  principles. Amongst  these generally acceptable accounting principles, he continued,  include regulation 15  (  4) of  the Banking  and  Financial  Institutions (Management  of  Risk Assets) Regulations, 2001 (which he referred to as "the BoT Regulations"). According to the  BoT Regulations, once a loan is classified as  a  loss,  it has  to  be  taken  out  in  the  period  in  which  it  appears  as uncollectible.  In other  words,  that  loss  has  either  to  be  charged  off  or written off from  the  financial  statements  of  the  bank  as  provided  for  by regulation 7 which states:

"(7) Every bank and financial institution shall charge  off or  write  off all  loans classified loss at  the end of every quarterly review. Recoveries  out of the charged  off accounts shall be  recognized as per  requirement  of  the National Board  of  Accountants  and  Auditors (NBM) accounting standards and guidelines. /r

Mr.  Mukebezi  next  submitted  on  how,  guided  by  the  Banking  and Financial Institutions  (Management of  Risk Assets) Regulations, 2001, the appellant charged off  loss that  arose from "non-performing  loss," and in so doing relied on section 25(4) (a) of the ITA, 2004 which states-

''25(  4) Subject to the provisions of subsection (SJ  where in  calculating income on an accrual basis a person includes an amount  to  which the person is entitled and the person later-

## (  a) Disclaims an entitlement to receive the amount· or"

Mr. Mukebezi expressed his regrets on how the  respondent, relying on sections  18  (b)  and  39  (d)  of  the  ITA,  2004,  had  refused  to  allow  the charging-off  the  non-performing  loss on  the  reasoning that  the  loss must have been written  off  from  the  appellant's account.  Mukebezi extended his regrets  to  the Board,  which  had  earlier  on  supported  the  respondent's position.

Mr. Mukebezi urged us to  accept the  appellant's  position that  section 25(4)  and  25 (5)  of  the  ITA,  2004 should  be applied and that  we  should reject  the  respondent's  reliance on  sections  18(b)  and  39(d)  of  the  ITA, 2004.  The  learned  advocate  for  the  appellant  also  submitted  that  it  is

wrong to  hold that  deductable  bad debts  must be written  off.  He referred us to  regulations  20 and  21 of  the  BoT Regulations which  allow  banks to provide for  100% deduction  on loans which are classified as loss, and that these  BoT regulations  are  reflected  in section  25  (S)(a)  of  the  ITA  which provides:

'J1 person  may  disclaim  the  entitlement  to  receive  an amount or write off as bad debt claim of a person-

(a  )-in the  case of  a  debt  claim of  a  financial  institution only  after the  debt  claim  has  become  a  bad  debt  as determined  in  accordance with  the  relevant  standards established by the Bank of  Tanzania. //

According to  the  appellant's learned advocate, the  above-cited section 25  (5)  (a)  of  the  ITA,  2004  gave the  appellant  an  option  to  disclaim an entitlement  to  receive the  amount  (  charging  off)  or  to  write  off  the  loan which  in  this  case  had,  according  to  the  appellant's  learned  advocate, already been approved by the  Bank of Tanzania (the BoT). That  is, in case a taxpayer  chooses to  disclaim the  entitl ement  to  recover  the  loans in  a given  year  of  income,  the  specific  loss es  approved  by  the  BoT becomes expenditure  on  the  part  of  the  taxpayer  for  that  specific  year  of  income. That, in light of the option the  appellant had under section  25(  4) (a) of the

ITA, 2004, Mr. Mukebezi argued that the  Board, the Tribunal as well as the respondent, were  all  wrong  to  demand  writing  off  of  the  bad  debts.  He submitted  also  that  the  route  taken  by  the  respondent  through  section 18(b) and 39(b) of ITA, 2004 is also wrong.

On  his  part,  Mr.  Juma  Salum  Beleko, the  learned  advocate  for  the respondent, came out  in  full  support  of  the  decision of  the  Tribunal  and urged us to  dismiss the  appeal for  want  of  merit.  He stated that  it  is the respondent, and not the  BoT, that  has the statutory  authority  and power to collect taxes, including the administration of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

Mr. Beleko then took time to outline the salient statutory  provisions of the  ITA,  2004  which  are  applicable  to this  appeal  as  opposed  to  the provisions cited by Mr. Mukebezi. He highlighted the significance of section 18 of  the  ITA  2004. This  provision is important,  he submitted,  because it provides guidance in  calculating a tax  payer's  income, and  it  also guides the calculation the  deduction of loss incurred during a year of income from a business.  He insisted that  this is the provision which guides taxpayers like the  appellant,  when  they  incur  loss, on  how to  make deductions for  that loss. He referred  us to  section 3 of  the  ITA,  2004, which  defines what  a debt claim is.  Mr.  Beleko similarly  underscored the  significance of  section

36  of the same  Act,  which  guides  taxpayers  like  the appellant, in calculating gains  and  losses so  important  in  determining  the  taxpayers' respective  tax liabilities.

Mr.  Beleko went  on  to  submit  that  for  a financial  institution  like the appellant, section 39(d)  of  the  ITA,  2004 provides the  ultimate  guide for deduction of  bad debts. He urged us to  find that  the  provisions of section 25(5)  (a)  of  the  ITA,  2004 which was suggested to  us by the  appellant's learned advocate,  are  not  applicable  because no  other  provision  is  as significant as section 39(  d)  of  the  ITA,  2004 in  deductions of  bad debts. Section 39(  d),  he went  on, sets out the  basic conditions precedent before deductions of  bad debts can be accepted by the  respondent. In  so far  as Mr.  Beleko  is  concerned,  conditions  outlined under  section  39(d)  are backed  by  the logic  that the appellant  bank  should  not be  allowed deduction of  debts  which  they  can still  pursue and  realize by  selling off their  collaterals.  The  learned  advocate  urged  us  to hold  that  with  the existence of  very  clear  conditions provided  under section  39(  d)  to  guide deduction  of  bad  debts,  there  is  no  room  for  the  appellant  to  peg  its deduction of bad debts under the BoT Regulations.

Mr.  Beleko was emphatic  in  his submission that  the  appellant  cannot rely on any other  laws to  guide the  determination  of  bad debts where the ITA,  2004  has  prescribed  applicable  provisions  as  administered  by  the respondent. In  so far  as he is concerned, the  BoT Regulations cited  by the appellant's learned advocate are not income tax  provisions. The provisions of  the ITA, 2004  override  and  take  precedence  over  any  other  laws, including  the  BoT  Regulations referred  to  by  Mr.  Mukebezi. And  on  that emphatic  note,  Mr.  Beleko urged  us to  dismiss the  appeal  in  its entirety, and with costs.

Mr.  Mukebezi was  quick  in  his  rejoinder,  to  remind  Mr.  Beleko that section  25(5)  (a)  of  the  ITA,  2004  makes a  direct  reference  to  the  BoT Regulations, and to that  extent  those  BoT Regulations are part of the  ITA, 2004:-

'125(5)  A person may disclaim the entitlement  to receive an  amount  or  write  off  as  bad  a  debt  claim  of  the person-

(  a)  in  the  case of  a debt  claim of  a financial institution, only  after the  debt  claim  has  become  a  bad  debt  as determined  in  accordance with  the  relevant  standards established by the Bank of  Tanzania;//

With  that remainder, Mr. Mukebezi  urged  us  to ensure  that the provisions  of  the  ITA,  2004  and  the BoT  Regulations  are  harmoniously constructed  to  enable the  appellant  to  prepare  its  books of  accounts and make proper  claims for  deductions  of  bad  debts  and  losses. The  learned counsel urged us to  take  note of the way  Mr. Beleko studiously  avoided to submit on the  choice of options available to  the appellant  under section 25 (5) (a) of the ITA, 2004  which is in full compliance  with the BoT Regulations.

Once again,  Mr. Mukebezi through  his rejoinder,  urged  us to  overturn the decision of the Tribunal  and allow this appeal with  costs.

From the  grounds  of  appeal and  submissions thereon,  it  seems clear to  us that  this  appeal  centres  on  the  identification  and  interpretation of provisions governing  losses  arising  from  bad debts  which  are  deductable for  income tax  purposes.  Mr.  Mukebezi, the  appellant's  learned  advocate, has on one  hand staked a  position that  if we  accept that  sections 21  (1), 25  (4), (5) read  together with  the BoT  Regulations  are  applicable,  the appellant  bank  is  entitled  to  claim  a  deduction  of  its  bad  debt  without having to write  off the debts concerned from  its books of accounts.

Mr. Beleko, the  respondent's learned advocate, has on the other  hand, urged us to  resort  to  sections 3,  18 and specifically 39(d).  While agreeing that  section 39  (  d)  also provides that  debt  claim  may  become a bad debt as determined in accordance with the relevant standards established by the Bank of Tanzania, Mr. Beleko was quick to  point at a condition  in the same section 39 (d) of  ITA,  2004 which  requires the  appellant  to  write  off  that debt from the appellant's book of accounts.

After  hearing  the  submissions of  the  learned advocates of  both  sides on the  grounds  of  appeal  and on  the  salient  background  facts,  the  main area  of  contention between  the  two  opposing  sides  which  calls  for  our determination, is  which provisions  of the Income  Tax  Act, 2004 are applicable to the deductibility  of the Appellant's impairment  provisions; that is,  between  section 25  (5) of  the  ITA, 2004, on  one  hand,  and  sections 18(b) and 39(d) of the ITA, 2004, on the other hand.

This Court  considers  that the choice  between  which set of the provisions  of the Income Tax  Act, 2004 that are applicable  to the deductibility  of  the  Appellant's  impairment provisions  is  as  much  about statute interpretation.

Courts in Tanzania are  bound to  apply plain language of a Statute to give  effect  to  the intention  of  the  Legislature.  In CHIRIKO HARUNA DAVID  V. KANGI  ALPHAXARD LUGORA &amp; TWO OTHERS, Civil Appeal No.  36  of  2012  (unreported),  the  Full  Bench of  this  Court  at  page  17, reiterated the  need to  employ the  plain meaning of  the  words to  discover the intention of the Legislature in a Statute:-

" .. . We wish to observe here by  way of emphasis 1 even if it  is  at the  expense of  repeating  ourselves 1 that  one  of the  cardinal  rules  of  construction  is  that  courts  should give legislation its plain meaning. r/

It is  noteworthy  to  observe that  the  ITA,  2004  is divided  into  Parts, Divisions  and  sub-divisions,  each  is  further divided  into  sections,  sub› sections, paragraphs etc, catering for  various aspects of the  income taxing regime in Tanzania. Every provision under these provisions must be given effect to.  As was stated in COLORADO GENERAL ASSEMBLY, Office  of Legislative Legal Services, "Common  Applied Rules  of  Statute Construction:"

"Statutes  are  to  be read  as a  whole 1 in  context,  and,  if possible 1 the  court  is  to give  effect  to  every  word  of  the statute. The court is bound to give consistent,

harmonious,, and sensible effect  to all  of  the parts  of  a statute/  to the extent possible. //

## In CHIRIKO HARUNA DAVID V.  KANGI ALPHAXARD LUGORA (supra)  the Full  Bench  of the Court  added:

11 The traditional  wisdom is  that  the  search  for  legislative intent is central to statutory interpretation. And the legislatures  intent  is normally ascertained from  the  words it has  used.  The  word  used  may  be  found  in  the  title/ preamble/ chapter headings/ marginal notes/ punctuations/ definitions/ etc. of the statute. //\_page 18.

Section 25 (5)  of the  ITA,  2004, on one hand, and sections 18(b) and 39(d) of the ITA, 2004, on the other  hand, are all part of the same Statute, the Income  Tax  Act, 2004. Each  provision  was  intended for distinct purpose, and  it  is the  duty  incumbent  upon the  courts  to  do just  that.  As such, these  provisions  require  harmonious  construction  to  give  effect  to every word used. In BULYANHULU GOLD  MINES  LIMITED  V. COMMISSIONER GENERAL (TRA), Consolidated Civil appeals No. 89 &amp; 90  of  2015  (unreported) the  Court  stated  the  following on  harmonious construction of Tax statute:

"  ... We are compelled to observe generally that  the most common  rule  of  interpretation  is  that  every part  of  a statute  must be understood in a harmonious manner by reading and constructing every part  of it  together  . ... we also  take  it  to  be  an  established principle  of  statutory interpretation  that  in  interpreting  the  Income  Tax Act the  whole  Act  must  be  considered in  relation  to  the particular  section  and  especially with  reference  to  the interpretation  section and the methods set out in the Act to arrive at  what is the chargeable  income.//

Later on page 20, the Court in BULYANHULU GOLD  MINES LIMITED warned  that 11 /ncome  Tax  Act must be read as a whole and it is dangerous to read it in piecemeal.//

Section  25(5)  (a)  of  the  ITA,  2004  which  the  appellant  has  placed great  reliance  on,  falls  under  Part  III of  sub-division  [A]  of  Division  II, which  is titled  as 11 Tax Accounting and  Timing". We are  not  in  any  doubt that  the  intention  of the  Legislature is to  devote this  area of the  provisions of the  ITA covering sections 20 to  26 for  purpose of providing  guidance to tax  payers like the  appellant.  These provisions guide in the preparations of tax  returns  before  presenting  the  same for  assessment by the  respondent Commissioner General.

In  other  words  our  reading  of  section  25(  4)  and  25(5)  (a)  of  the  ITA shows one gets  the  impression  that  in the  preparations  of  its  tax  accounts to  be assessed by the  respondent,  the  appellant  is given  the  opportunity  to indicate therein,  what  debt  claim has in the  appellant's  accounting,  become a bad debt  ripe  for  deduction  by  the  respondent  and  this  will  also  include proof  to the respondent that the bad  debt the appellant proposes  for deduction  when  the  respondent  finally  makes its final  tax  assessment. The relevant  subsections (  4)  and (5)  (a)  of section  25 states:-

11 25(  4) Subject  to  the provisions of subsection (5/ where in calculating income on an accrual basis a person includes an  amount  to which  the  person  is  entitled  and  the person later-

- (  b) disclaims an entitlement  to receive the amount;  or
- (  c) in the case where the amount constitutes a debt claim of the person,  the person  writes  off  the  debt  as bad,  the person  ma‰ at  the  time  of  disclaimer  or  writing  o~ deduct the amount disclaimed or written off in calculating the persons  income.
- (5) A person may disclaim the entitlement to receive an amount or write off as bad debt claim of a person-

(a)-in  the  case of a debt claim of a financial institution, only  after  the  debt  claim  has  become a  bad  debt  as determined  in  accordance with  the  relevant  standards established by the Bank of  Tanzania. "

In  so far  as "deductions"  are concerned, the  governing  provisions are covered in subdivision I  [D]  of  Part III,  expressed under sections 11 to  19. From  the plain meaning  and  harmonious  construction shows  that the intention  of  the Legislature  here  is  that, after receiving  the  accounting reports or  returns  from  taxpayer  like the  appellant,  the  respondent  makes its own  assessment,  and  has  a  final word on  whether any item is deductible.

In  subdivision A of  Division III of  Part III, there  are sections 36 to  41 which include  section 39(d), wherein Legislature  intended to provide guidance to  the  respondent  in the  calculation  of  gains and  losses, cost of assets and realization etc.

We reckon that  sections 25(4),  (5)  of the  ITA,  2004 on one hand, and sections  18  and  39(d)  of  the  ITA,  2004  are  not  in  conflicting positions. They are  harmonious  in  so far  as they  provide  for  distinct  matters.  While sections  25(  4  ),  (5) provide  for  the  preparation  of  accounts,  returns  and

proposal for  deductions,  sections  18 and 39(d)  of  the  ITA,  2004 gives the respondent the  leverage  to  receive  returns  and  accounts  from  taxpayers and enjoys finality  in the assessment, allowing or disallowing deductions.

Much as the  appellant  has sought  refuge  under  section  25(5)  (a)  of the ITA, 2004, we must point out  here that  the appellant did  not discharge its  evidential  burden  to  prove  that  it  complied  with  any  one  of  the  two options the  appellant  claimed to  have complied  with  under  section  25  (5) (a)  of  the  ITA,  2004.  The  appellant  has  not  shown  which  option  it  had complied  with. There is no  evidence  to show  whether the appellant exercised the  option  of  disclaiming any entitlement  to  receive the  amount (which it described as charge off).

At  the Board  where  the  appellant  had  the  opportunity to present evidence to  prove  its compliance with  section  25(5)  (a)  of  the  ITA,  2004, only  sweeping statements  were  made  by their  learned advocates without so much as backing up the  same with  evidence. An example  is where  the Board was informed:

"Honourable Vice  Chairperson  and Members  of the Boar~  according  to  the  generally  accepted accounting principles, and particularly the generally accepted

accounting  principles  applicable  to  financial  institutions and  which  were previously  accepted by  the Respondent the Appellant  reported  and accounted  fo 0  inter  alia 1 the following:

## (a)Bad debts;

(b)-Risk assets (  comprising exclusives and doubtful debts);  and

(c)-Reserves.

Bad debts  were reported  after  being  duly  written  off  as required  by  the generally  accepted accounting  principles and as regulated by law in accordance with the Banking  and  Financial  Institutions Act;  2006 [Cap. 342] and  the Banking and Financial Institutions {Management of  Risk  Assets} Regulations, 2008 [GN No. 374 of 2008]  (hereinafter  collectively referred  to as "the Regulatory Laws").

There  is similarly  no evidence to  justify  the  appellant's  claim that  the Bank of Tanzania had approved any loan loss of the  appellant to  be written off. For instance,  on  page  14 of  the  Supplementary  Record of  Appeal the appellant  claims  that it had  received  approval  letters  from  the  Bank  of Tanzania which is not evidenced on record:

" .. . For the  years of  income 2005,  2006 and 200  7, total annual amounts of TAS 1,499,000, 000, TAS 3,537,000,000,  and TAS  5,134,000,000 were established and charged to the impairment account after receiving approval from the Bank  of Tanzania {BoT) that the ascertained amounts complied with the Regulatory Laws. The  BoT  approval letters were served upon the respondent together  with the notices of objection. " [Emphasis added].

For the foregoing  reasons, this appeal is devoid of merit and the  same is hereby dismissed in its entirety  with  costs.

DATED at DODOMA this  6 th day of July, 2018.
