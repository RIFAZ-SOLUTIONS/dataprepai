Date of Last Order: 31.05.2018

## S.A.N WAMBURA, J:

This ruling is in  respect of the  preliminary objection  on  a  point of law raised by Mr. Nyakunga learned counsel for the 1s t respondent who is in the Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority to the effect that:-

- 1. The court has no jurisdiction to entertain this matter.
- 2. The applicant has no locus stand against the  1 st respondent.

The  court  thus  granted  leave  for hearing  of  the  preliminary objections to proceed by way of written submissions.  I  thank both parties for adhering to the schedule.

In  supporting  of the  1s t   ground  of objection,  Mr.  Nyakunga averred  that  this  dispute  arose  from  the  decision  of  the 1s t respondent to enforce recovery measures under the Section 64 of  the  Tax  Administration  Act  No.  10  of  2015,  to  recover  Tshs. 539,282,968  being  Tax  due  to  Majembe  Auction  Mart  Limited. That  in  doing  so  Yono  Auction  Mart  was  instructed  to  attach houses  located  at  Plot  No.  250,  Mbezi  Beach,  and  Plot  No.  155 Mikocheni both located in Kinondoni Municipality, Dar es salaam.

The  learned  counsel  referred  to  Section  53(1)  of  the  Tax Administration Act,  No.  10 of 2015. He therefore contended that this  court  has  no  jurisdiction  to  determine  the  application  at hand.

Responding  to  the  same,  Mr.  Nyika  submitted  that  the application  at  hand  is  not  a  tax matter nor dispute  arising  from

revenue  laws  administered  by  the  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority therefore it does not fall under nor is it limited to the jurisdiction of the Tax Appeals Board.  He stated  that this application is a land matter in which the applicants'  properties are about to  be sold by the respondents without any cause.

He averred that this court has jurisdiction  to determine the application as provided under Section  167 of the Land Act Cap. 133 R.E. 2002 and Section 37 of the Land Disputes Courts Act Cap. 216 R.E.2002.

On the second ground  of objection,  Mr.  Nyakunga was of the view that the applicants  have  no locus standi to sue the  1s t respondent because the 1s t respondent has never dealt with plots number 226  Block  C  Mikocheni  and  Plot  No.  258  Mbezi  Beach area.

Replying to the same, Mr. Nyika contended that applicants have  locus  to  sue  the  1s t   respondent  because  the  respondents intended  to  attach  and  sale  the  applicants  properties  and  not the properties mentioned in the warrant of distress.

Upon reading the submissions from learned counsel for the parties,  and  having  considered the relevant lav/,  the main issue for determination is whether the objections raised by the learned counsel for the respondent are meritorious.

Upon perusal of the application at hand, I  would agree with Mr.  Nyika  that  this  is  a  land  matter  in  which  the  applicants' properties  are  about  to  be  sold  by the  respondents. That it is  a dispute  concerning  land  whose  jurisdiction  is  vested  upon  this court under Section  167 of the Land Act Cap.  133 RE.E. 2002 and Section 37 of the Land Disputes Courts Act Cap. 216 R.E. 2002.

However as the applicant concedes that matter is in respect of execution of the Tax Tribunals Order then I  believe it was proper to first appeal to the Board as provided for under sections 7 and 12 of the Tax Revenue Appeals.

Applicants  maintain  that  this  cause  is  for  challenging  the distant  of  its  goods  because  it  had  settled  its  tax  liabilites.  The same could thus be resolved at the tribunal and not at this Court because it is all in respect of tax and there is no dispute in respect of ownership of the said landed properties as conceded by the applicants.

In  the  circumstances,  I   uphold the  1s t  ground  of preliminary objection that this is  not purely a  dispute on  land ownership but originates from execution of a decision done by another tribunal which has jurisdiction to resolve the same. This Court thus has no jurisdiction  at this juncture to entertain the same. This is because the  applicant still  has  an  avenue  for the  remedy sought  at  the said tribunal.

I   thus uphold this ground and have no reason to determine the  2n d   ground  herein  raised.  The  application  and  the  main  suit are herein struck out. Costs follow the event.
