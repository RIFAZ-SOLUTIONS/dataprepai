## RULING

Date of  Last Order:  22/03/2018

Date of  Ruling: 06/04/2018

## L.L.Mashaka, 3

This is a ruling in respect  of  preliminary  objection filed by  the respondent Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  on  the  21s t  November  2017  that the application for revision filed by the applicant Mbonipa Kasase contravenes  Rule 24 (3) (c) and (d) of the Labour Court Rules, GN No.  106 of 2007.

The  hearing  of  the  preliminary  objection  was  by  way  of  written submissions  and  it  is  noted  that  the  respondent's  submission  was  drawn and filed by Mr. Raphael Rwezaura, Advocate from Apex  Attorneys Advocates  who  represented  the  respondent  and  those  by  the  applicant drawn and filed in person.

The  point of the  preliminary objection  is that the  affidavit in  support of the application  deponed  by the applicant himself does  not disclose legal issues  that  arise  from  the  material  facts  and  reliefs  sought  as  per  Rule 24(3)(c)  and  (d)  of  the  Labour  Court  Rules,  GN  106  of  2007.  That  the affidavit  in  support  of the  application  does  not  meet the  requirements  of the  law  above  whereas  the  requirements  must  be  complied  with  by  the applicant  but  the  same  has  not  been  adhered  to  hence  the  same  is incurably defective. That the said provision of Rule 24 (3)  amongst others requires  the  affidavit  in  support  of  the  application  to  contain  legal  issues and reliefs pertaining  to  the  application  at  hand  and  the  affidavit  in support  of  the  application  is  defective  and  the  application  is  incompetent before the Court fit for being struck out.

In  response  applicant  submitted  that  the  reliefs  in  the  affidavit  are sought  in  the  chamber  summons  and  therefore  are  the  prayers  made  in the application  and  went on  to  submit on the  merits  of the application  on the  finding  of  Hon.Arbitrator  which  is  the  gist  of the  application  at  hand and has not been heard yet.

He finally  argued  that the  preliminary  objection  thereto  has  failed  to show  the  defectiveness  of  the  affidavit  hence  the  same  lacks  merit.  He referred  the  Court  to  the  case  of Mukisa  Biscuits  Manufacturing  Co. Ltd Vs West End Distributors Ltd (1969) E.A.C.A 696 on the preliminary objection that:-

"so  far as I am  aware ; a  preliminary objection  is in  the  nature  of what used to  be  a  demurrer.  It raises pure point of law  which  when  is argued on the assumption that aii facts pleaded by other aside are correct If cannot be raised if  any fact has to be ascertained or if what is sought is exercise of  judicial discretion ."

That the  said  preliminary  objection  does  not  meet the  requirements of being a  preliminary objection  hence the same be dismissed with costs as it has no legal  basis.

In  rejoinder,  Learned  Counsel  for  the  respondent  argued  that  the prayers  sought  in  the  chamber summons  cannot  be  the  same.  That since there  is  mandatory  provisions  of the  law  which  requires the  contents  of a document to  be adhered  and  a  party cannot ignore  it thus the  affidavit  is defective. The respondent reiterated his submission in chief on the preliminary objection.

On the cited  case  of Mukisa  Biscuits  Manufacturing  Co.  Ltd  Vs West  End  Distributors  Ltd  (1969)  E.A,C,A  696, Learned  Counsel submitted  that  the  applicant  wrongly  interpreted  the  holding  of  the  case law since the same is on  what amounts to a  preliminary objection to  be a point of law  which  is  properly  raised  by  the  respondent  on  the  defects  of the  applicant's  supporting  affidavit  which  is  contrary  to  Rule  24(3)  of the Labour  Court Rules 2007, Government  Notice No. 106 of 2007, the applicant has failed to comply with.

Learned Counsel for the respondent therefore prayed for the preliminary objection to be sustained and the application be dismissed with costs.

Having  gone through  written  submissions  by  both  parties  and  Court records  at  hand,  the  key  issue  for  determination  in  the  raised  preliminary objection  is  whether  or  not  the  applicant's  affidavit  has  comply  with  the requirements of Rule 24(3)(c) and (d) of the Labour Court Rules, Government Notice 106 of 2007.  Rule 24(3) provides that:-

24(3).  The application shaii be supported by an affidavit,  which shall clearly and concisely set out-

- (a) The names, description and the address of  the parties;
- (b) A statement of the material facts in a  chronological order,  on which the application is based.
- (c) Statement of legal issues  that arise  from  the  materia! facts; and

## (d) The reliefs sought

[ Emphasis is mine].

The contention by the applicant is that the raised preliminary objection  does  not confirm  to what is  a  preliminary objection  thus  lacking the  key  elements  thereto,  quoting  the  holding  from Mukisa  Biscuits Manufacturing Co. Ltd Vs. West  End Distributors Ltd (1969) E.A.C.A 696 and that the prayers are contained in the chamber summons, without a  flicker of doubt this Court holds the  preliminary objection  raised qualifies  to  be  so  as  defined  in  the  said  case.  The  applicant's  affidavit  in support of the application does not meet the requirements of Rule 24(3)(c) &amp;(d)  of  the  Labour  Court  Rules,  Government  Notice  No.  106  of  2007  as rightly  argued  by  Learned  Counsel  for the  respondent.  The  raised  point of objection  is on  a  pure  point of law as  per requirement of the  law above as well  as  case  laws,  particularly Mukisa  Biscuits  Manufacturing  Co.  Ltd Vs.  West  End  Distributors  Ltd, (1969)  E.A.C.A  696,  and  the  case  of Karata  Ernest  and  Others  Vs.  The  Attorney  General, Civil  Revision No.  10 of 2010,Court of Appeal of Tanzania at Dar Es salaam,  [unreported]

at  pages  7  and  8,  His  Lordship  Rutakangwa,JA  [as  he  then  was],  in  that case  the Court  of  Appeal expounded  in  depth  what  is  a preliminary objection.

The  affidavit  deponed  by the  applicant  in  support of this  application does  not show the  statements  of the  legal  issues therein  arising  from  the material  facts,  and  does  not  have  reliefs  sought  by  the  applicant contrary to Rule 24(3)(c) and (d) of the Labour Court Rules GN No.  106 of 2007.

In the circumstance, the preliminary objection raised by the respondent  is  merited  for  the  application  for  revision  is  supported  by  a defective affidavit which  renders the application  incompetent. It ought to be struck out.

For  the  interest  of  justice, I grant  the  applicant  leave  to  file  a competent application for revision within  14 days from today.

This  application  for  revision  is  accordingly  struck  out  with  no  orders as to costs.

So ordered
