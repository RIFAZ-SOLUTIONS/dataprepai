## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

22n d  October &amp; 2n d  November, 2021

## MWANDAMBO. J.A.:

The  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  (the  Tribunal)  dismissed  Tax Appeal  No.  12  of  2019  preferred  by  John  Epimaki  Kessy,  the  appellant, against the  decision  of the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  Board).  The Board  had dismissed  an  appeal  against an objection  decision  made  by the respondent involving  liability for payment of capital gains tax. The Tribunal concurred  with  the  Board  that the  appellant  had  not adduced  evidence to entitle him  to benefit from the protection accorded to a transferor associate of an  asset in  terms of section  44 (2)  of the Income Tax Act,  2004  [Cap. 332 R.E. 2006] (the Act), hence, the instant appeal.

The factual  setting  involved  in  this  appeal  is  simple  enough  to  tell. The  appellant  was,  until  April  2011,  the  registered  owner  of  a  landed property  known  as  plot  No.  21,  Mikocheni  Light  Industrial  Area,  Dar  Es Salaam  City  comprised  in  certificate  of  title  No.  43521,  henceforth,  the property.  He acquired  the  property  in  1992  from  where  he  conducted  his business; a building contractor  trading  as  J.E. Construction  as  a  sole proprietor.  The  sole  proprietorship  survived  until  1999  when  the  appellant together with  one  Beda  J.  Kessy  formed  a  limited  liability  company;  X  E . Construction  Company  Limited  (the Company) with  99% shares owned  by the appellant.  For that matter, the appellant was,  in terms of section  3  (c) of the Act,  an  associate  of the  Company. It  is  common  ground  that the Company  assumed  the  business  hitherto  conducted by  the  appellant. Subsequently,  the appellant transferred  his property to the Company upon the Commissioner for Lands approving the transfer on 18/04/2011.

In terms of section 39 (a) of the Act, the transfer of ownership of an asset  is  treated  as  a   realisation  of that  asset  by  the  transferor  attracting payment  of  capital  gains  tax  calculated under  section 36  of  the  Act. Considering that the appellant transferred the property to the Company; an associate,  he  was treated  as  having  realized  the  property  and  derived  an amount in the manner set out under section 44 (1) of the Act.  Otherwise, the appellant was eligible for the treatment under section 44 (2) of the Act

provided  that  both  the  Company  and  him  moved  the  respondent  in  that behalf subject to compliance with the requirements under section 44 (4) of the same Act.

Subsequent to the  approval  of the transfer  by the Commissioner for Lands  as  alluded  to  earlier,  on 11/05/2011,  the  appellant  submitted  a declaration  of  gain from  realization of  an interest  in land  or  building presumably for the purpose of computation of capital gains tax (exhibit A4). That application was followed  by the respondent's letter (exhibit A5) dated 17/06/2011  in which the respondent queried some of the particulars in the declaration including, the owner of the asset and error in the principal in the calculation of the gain. Through that letter, the respondent vacated the tax assessments issued earlier and intimated to issue a fresh notice of assessment  reflecting  the  appropriate  tax.  Although  the  record  does  not reflect any form of assessment, it would appear the respondent issued one; No. 8986 reflected in the notice of objection vide letter Ref.  No.  PAN/07/11 dated  11/07/2011  (exhibit A6) lodged  by PAN &amp; Associates; the appellant's tax  consultants.  One  of  the  peculiar  features  in  exhibit  A6  was  that  the transfer of the asset was governed by section 44(2) of the Act to which the appellant  met  the  conditions  prescribed  under  section  44  (4)  thereof.  In support  of that assertion,  the Tax  Consultants  indicated  to  have  attached

their  client's  (appellant)  letter  electing  the  transfer  to  be  governed  by section 44 (2) of the Act.

The respondent rejected the objection  which  resulted  into an  appeal before the Board predicated on three grounds, namely; one, the respondent's decision  offended  section  44(2)  of the Act;  two,  the decision lacked  fairness  and,  three,  the  assessment  offended  section  49(2)  of the Tax  Administration  Act  No.  10  of  2015.  The  Board  dismissed  the  appeal having  found  that  the  appellant  had  not  furnished  any  evidence  proving compliance  with  section  44(4)  (e)  to  avail  him  of  the  treatment  under section  44  (2)  of the  Act.  However,  the  Board  directed  the  respondent to issue a fresh assessment accompanied  by the relevant computations based on the market value obtaining in the year 2011; the date of the transfer.

The Board's decision triggered an appeal to the Tribunal premised on three grounds. The first ground which is critical to the determination of this appeal, faulted the Board for failing to address his grounds of appeal on the applicability of section 44 (2) of the Act.  Paragraph five of the statement of appeal  to  the  Tribunal alluded to the  appellant's notice of  objection premised on the fact that the appellant had elected to apply section 44 (2) of the Act which exempted him from payment of capital gains tax. The said letter  was  annexed  thereto  marked  JEK-10  on  the  basis  of  which  the appellant sought  leave  under  section  17  (2)  of The Tax  Revenue  Appeals

Act, [Cap. 408  R.E. 2010], (the  TRAA)  to be  admitted  as  additional evidence. According to the appellant, the admission of that evidence had a serious bearing on the outcome of his appeal in his favour.

Be it as it  may,  the Tribunal  refused  to  grant the appellant leave for the admission  of additional evidence  primarily because the appellant failed to meet the conditions precedent for its admission. The Tribunal concluded that the appellant's quest was an  afterthought aimed  at filling  gaps  in  his wanting  evidence  before the  Board.  Ultimately,  the Tribunal  dismissed  the appellant's appeal  which  has culminated  in  the  instant appeal  premised  in two grounds of appeal.

The  first  ground  faults  the  Tribunal  for  its  failure  to  exercise  its discretion  judiciously  for  the  admission  of additional  evidence  pursuant  to section  17  (2)  of  the  TRAA.  The  second  one  contends  that  the  Tribunal erred in holding that the appellant did not comply with section 44 (4) (e) of the Act.

The appellant has enjoyed the services of a firm  of advocates styled as B  &amp; E  AKO Law right from the Board up to this Court. During the hearing, Mr.  Allan  Nlawi  Kileo,  appeared  assisted  by  Messrs  Wilson  Mukebezi  and Stephen  Axwesso,  all  learned  advocates  to  prosecute  the  appeal.  Messrs Cherubin Ludovick Chuwa and Harold Gugami, learned Senior State Attorneys teamed up to resist the appeal on behalf of the respondent.

Ahead  of the  hearing,  the  learned  advocates  for  the  appellant  filed their written  submissions  in  support of the appeal  so did  the  respondent's learned counsel in reply. Mr.  Kileo had a few aspects to highlight by way of oral  submissions which  he did  after adopting the written submissions. The substance  of  the  submissions  both  in  writing  and  orally  focused  on  the reason why the appellant found  it accessary to ask for leave for admission of additional  evidence.  He argued that the appellant's  resort to  section  17 (2) of the TRAA was necessitated by the Board's stance raising an issue suo mottu in  relation to lack of evidence proving compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act without affording the parties right to be heard on it. According to the learned advocates,  had the Board afforded the appellant opportunity to be  heard,  they  should  have  produced  evidence  by  way  of  a  letter  dated 11/07/2011  annexed  to  the  statement  of  appeal  marked JEK-10 on  the basis of which he sought leave of the Tribunal to be admitted as additional evidence under section  17(2) of the TRAA which  leave was refused  by the Tribunal.  The  learned  advocates  argued  further that,  considering  that  the appellant was denied right to be heard on the alleged  non-compliance with section 44  (2)  of  the  Act, the  admission  of  additional evidence  was necessary and the Tribunal ought to have granted the leave sought. Several authorities from decided cases were cited along with Article 13 (6) (a) of the Constitution  of  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania,  1977  to  underscore  the

argument that breach of fundamental right to be heard is a fatal irregularity which  should have  been  sufficient  to  grant  leave  to  admit  additional evidence.

At any rate,  the appellant's advocate argued,  the  letter sought to  be admitted  as  additional  evidence was  not  new to the  respondent as  it was part of appellant's notice of objection  (exhibit A6) thus,  no  prejudice could have been occasioned  had the Tribunal exercised its discretion in favour of the appellant.

With regard to ground two, the learned advocate argued that contrary to  the Board's  decision,  there  was  ample  evidence  that  the  appellant complied with section 44 (2) of the Act through an application  by way of a letter dated 10/07/2011 received by the respondent on 15/07/2011 notifying  him of his election  under section 44 (2) of the Act (annex JEK-10 to  the  statement  of  appeal). Responding  to  the  Court's  question,  the learned advocate was resolute that the appellant and his associate complied with section 44 (4) (e) of the Act thereby entitling the appellant to benefit from  the  protection  under  section  44  (2)  thereof. On  the  basis  of  the foregoing, the learned advocate invited us to allow the appeal with costs.

Mr.  Chuwa  was  fairly  brief  in  his  written  and  oral  submissions. In essence, the learned Senior State Attorney argued in the written submissions  that the  appellant failed  to  meet the  threshold  necessary  for the  Tribunal's  exercise  of  discretion  to  allow  the  admission  of  additional evidence. To reinforce his argument,  Mr.  Chuwa  relied on our decision  in As Sajan v. Co-operative and Rural Development Bank [1991] T.L.R. 44 for the proposition that admission of additional evidence is subject to the appellant  meeting  three  conditions  which  the  appellant  failed  to  meet. According to  him, evidence proving the appellant's compliance with section 44  (4)  of  the  Act  never  featured  before  the  Board;  it  featured  after  its decision as an afterthought. The learned Senior State Attorney argued that since  the  appellant  did not  meet  the  conditions  for  the  admission  of additional  evidence,  the  Tribunal  was  right  in  refusing  the  prayer  in  that behalf. With that, the learned Senior State Attorney implored the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  his  rejoinder,  Mr. Kileo  reiterated  his  submissions  in  chief  and invited the Court to accept the proposition that the criteria for admission of additional evidence ought  to be looked at on their individual merit considering  that the  issue subject of the  additional  evidence did  not arise before the  Board.  He  reiterated  his  argument that the  additional  evidence became  necessary after the  Board  had  made a  decision  on  it holding  that the transfer of ownership of the asset by the appellant to the Company was

between associates who had not met the requirements under section 44 (4) (e) of the Act.

Having  examined  the  written  submissions  and  heard  counsel's  oral arguments for and  against the  appeal,  it  is  plain  that the  appeal  revolves around the Tribunal's exercise of its discretion against the appellant's quest for admission  of additional  evidence  in  pursuance of section  17 (2) of the TRAA. That means our discussion will  be conjointly on the two grounds of appeal. We find apposite at this stage to  restate the  legal  position  on the extent  to  which  higher  courts  can  interfere  with  lower  courts/tribunals exercise  of  their  discretion.  In The  Commissioner  General,  Tanzania Revenue Authority v.  New Musoma Textile Limited, Civil  Appeal  No. 119 of 2019 {unreported), the Court quoted a  passage from the judgment of  the  defunct  Court  of Appeal  for  East  Africa  in Mbogo  &amp; Another v. Shah [1968] E.A 93, 94 in which Sir Clement de Lestang, VP stated: -

"I  think  it  is  weii  settled  that  this  Court  will  not interfere  with  the  exercise  of its  discretion  by  an inferior court unless it is satisfied that the decision is clearly  wrong,  because  it has  misdirected itself or because it has acted on matters on  which it should not have acted or because it has failed to take into consideration matters which it should not have taken into consideration and in so doing arrived at a wrong conclusion."

The  bone  of  contention  against  the  Tribunal's  decision  is  that  the additional  evidence  by way of annex JEK-10 was known to the respondent as  it  formed  part  of  exhibit  A6  and  so  there  could  not  have  been  any prejudice  to  the  respondent  had  the  Tribunal  granted  the  prayer  for  its admission as additional evidence. Annex JEK-10 referred to in para 5  of the statement of appeal (at page 123 of the record of appeal) is shown to be a letter  in which  the  appellant  appears  to  have  made  an  election  under section 44  (2)  of the Act.  It is common ground that a copy of that letter is not reflected  in the record of appeal but its contents are reproduced  at page 130  showing  that the  appellant  is  an  associate  of J.E.R.  Construction  Co. Ltd.  It is that company to which  he the appellant had transferred  his asset requesting the respondent to apply section 44 (2) of the Act in effecting the transfer. The Tribunal concurred with the Board that much as the appellant was indeed an associate of the Company to which transfer of the asset had been made, there was no evidence of compliance with section 44 (4) (e) of the Act. There is no dispute that the provisions of section 44 (2) of the Act can be brought into play upon proof that both the transferor and transferee associates  have  made  the  election  in  writing.  We  find it necessary  to reproduce the section for easy of reference:

44.  (1) Subject to the provisions of this section and section 43, where  a  person  realises  an  asset  by  way  of transfer of  ownership of  the asset to an associate of

the  person  or  by  way  of  transfer  to  any  other person by way of  gift -

- (a) the person shall be treated  as deriving an amount in respect of the realisation equal to the greater of  the market value of  the asset or the net cost of the asset immediately before the realisation; and The Income Tax  Act  [CAP. 332 R.E  2019] 63
- (b) the person  who acquires ownership of the asset shall be  treated as incurring expenditure  of the amount  referred  to  in  paragraph (a) in the acquisition.
- (2)  Where  a person  realises an  asset,  being  a  business asset,  depreciable  asset or trading stock,  by  way of transfer of ownership of the asset to an associate of the person and the requirements of  subsection (4) are met-
- (a) the person shall be treated as deriving an amount in respect of the realisation equal to the net cost of the  asset immediately before  the  realisation; and
- (b)  the associate shall be treated as incurring expenditure of the amount referred to in paragraph (a) in acquiring the asset.
- (3)  Not  relevant.
- (4)  The requirements specified in subsection  (2) shall be­
- ta) either the  person or the associate is an entity;
- (b) the asset or assets are business assets, depreciable assets or trading stock of the

associate immediately after transfer by the person;

- (c)  at the time of  the transfer-
- (i) the person and the associate are residents; and
- (ii)  the  associate  or,  in  the  case  of an  associate partnership, none of its partners is exempt from income tax;
- (d)  there is continuity of underlying ownership in  the asset of  at least fifty  percent; and
- (e) an  election  for  subsection  (2)  to  apply  is made by both the person and the associate in writing. [Emphasis added]

Mr.  Kileo  would  have  us  hold  that there  was  such  compliance which should have been found to have existed by admission of additional evidence and  not  as  an  afterthought  ploy  to  patch  up  evidence  post  the  Board's decision.  To  appreciate  his  point, it will be  inevitable  to  examine  the appellant's notice of objection to the respondent (exhibit A6 at page 64 - 66 of the record of appeal) dated  11/07/2011. Through  item  2 in that exhibit, the appellant's Tax Consultants made attempt to  persuade the respondent that no profit had been realised by reason of the transfer of the asset from him  to  his  associate.  To  prove  that  the  appellant  had  made  an  election under  section  44  (2)  of  the  Act,  the  Tax  Consultants  indicated  that  they attached  their  client's  letter  for  the  respondent's  consideration.  The  client referred  to  in  exhibit  A6  is  none  other  than  the  appellant.  We  note  from page 67 of the record that J.E.R. Construction Co.  Ltd wrote a letter to the respondent through the Regional  Manager,  Kinondoni Tax Region informing

him  of  the  transfer  of  the  asset  to  her  by  his  associate  asking  him  to consider the transfer under section 44 (2) of the Act.

Although  there  is  no  indication  in  the  proceedings  how  that  letter found  its way into the record,  Mr.  Kileo  informed  us from the bar that the letter  was  part  of  exhibit  A6.  That  notwithstanding,  that  letter  could  not have been  part of exhibit A6 because what was attached to it judged from para 2 (at page 65) is a letter by the Tax Consultant's client rather than the Company  regardless  of  the  fact  that  the appellant was its majority shareholder. The fact that the Tax Consultant's notice of objection claimed that all  conditions  under  section  44  (4)  of the  Act  were  met,  there  is  no indication that the two letters were part of exhibit A6.  Indeed,  it seems to us that the relevant letter annexed to exhibit A6 was the letter referred to in para  5  of the statement of appeal whose contents are reproduced at page 130 of the record of appeal.  In our view, since, as shown above, the letter by way annex JEK-10 was already part of exhibit A6, it was a futile exercise to  ask  the  Tribunal  to  admit  it  as  additional  evidence.  If  anything,  the relevant letter for the purpose of the prayer for admission of oral evidence should have been the letter appearing at page 67 of the record.  Otherwise, it is not clear to us why the appellant could have omitted to annex the letter referred  to  in  exhibit  A6  meant  to  prove  that  he  had  made  the  election

under  section  44  (2)  and  complied  with  section  44  (4)  of  the  Act  as indicated in para 2  of exhibit A6.

Guided by the excerpt from Mbogo  &amp;  Another {supra), the appellant's advocates have not pointed out to us that the Tribunal's decision refusing to admit additional evidence is wrong  because it misdirected  itself or because it acted on matters which it should not have acted or by reason of  its  failure  to  take  into  consideration  matters  which  it  should  not  have taken into consideration.

On the contrary, from our own examination of the record, the Tribunal was alive to requirement under rule 6 (1) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board Rules,  2018 G.N.  No.  217 of 2018 which is substantially similar to rule 7(1) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board Rules, 2001 G.N.  No. 57 of 2001 in force on the date of lodging  the appeal  on the appellant's duty to  attach to  his statement of appeal all material documents necessary for the determination of his appeal. The Tribunal was equally alive to rule 6 (4) on the appellant's avenue to  file  additional  documents  three  days  before  the  date  fixed  for hearing which he did not utilise.

We appreciate the written submissions by the appellant's advocates at para  3.3  and  3.4  to  the  effect that the  prayer  for  admission  of additional evidence  became  necessary  because  the  Board  made  a  decision  on  the appellant's compliance with section 44 (2) of the Act which was a departure

from  the  issue  as  to  the  applicability  of that  section  to  the  transaction  in dispute. We have a genuine and unfeigned respect to the learned advocates but  we  are not prepared  to agree  with them. This is because  the applicability and  compliance with  section 44 (2) of the Act are  inseparable considering  that the  appellant's objection  by  way  of exhibit A6  hinged  on the compliance with the very section upon meeting all the conditions for its application  prescribed  by  section  44  (4)  of the  Act.  That  was  indeed  the appellant's case on which the Board found  no evidence of compliance with section 44 (4) (e). The Tribunal concurred with that finding having rejected the  appellant's  prayer  for  admission of  that  evidence  which  was  not additional  evidence  in  the  first  place.  Otherwise,  if  non-compliance  with section  44  (2)  of the  Act  was  not  the  same  as  its  application  to  the  tax transaction  in  dispute,  we  fail  to  understand  how  could  the  Board  have determined appellant's ground (i)  in support of the appeal contending that the  respondent  was  wrong  for  offending  section  44  (2)  of the  Act. The upshot of the foregoing  is that the appellant's submission contending as it does that the appellant was denied right to be heard on the issue involving compliance with section 44(2) of the Act falls apart.

There  is  yet  another  aspect  which  we  think  the  Tribunal's  decision cannot be successfully assailed. It relates to the relevance of the additional evidence sought to be tendered before the Tribunal.  Mr. Chuwa  referred to

our decision in As Sajan's case {supra) in relation to the third condition for the  admission  of additional  evidence;  credibility  of the  evidence  sought to be introduced. It is plain that the quest for admission of additional evidence by way of the letter referred to in para 5  of the statement of appeal as well as the one said to be part of exhibit A6 appearing at page 67 of the record of appeal,  were written  and  submitted to the  respondent  post assessment No.  8986  through  the  respondent's  letter  dated 17/06/2011.  It  is  not entirely  clear  to  us  how  could  the  appellant  have  availed  himself  of  the protection  from  section  44  (2)  of the  Act  post  tax  assessment.  It  is  vivid from  the  two  letters  that  the  appellant  asked  the  respondent  to  consider them in determining his objection to the assessment after the event.  Logic, common sense and the law dictate that the election under section 44 (2) of the  Act  should  have  been  made  prior to  the  assessment.  We  cannot  say with any degree of certitude that the credibility test was indeed met for the admission  of  evidence  which  was,  on  the  face  of  it  introduced  after  the respondent's  assessment.  In  the  premises  we  fail  to  understand  in  what way  the  evidence  introduced  at  the  objection  stage  would  have  been relevant for the determination of the appellant's case had  it been admitted by the Tribunal. Under the circumstances we endorse the submission by Mr. Chuwa  that  the  appellant  failed  to  meet  the  conditions  precedent  for admission of additional evidence. The appellant has failed to surmount the

hurdle  in  assailing  the  Tribunal  for  the  alleged  improper  exercise  of  its discretion  under section  17 (2) of the TRAA. That said, we find it difficult to interfere  with  the  Tribunal's  discretion refusing  to  admit  the  purported additional evidence by way of annex JEK-10.

In the event, we find no merit in the appeal and dismiss it with costs as we hereby do.
