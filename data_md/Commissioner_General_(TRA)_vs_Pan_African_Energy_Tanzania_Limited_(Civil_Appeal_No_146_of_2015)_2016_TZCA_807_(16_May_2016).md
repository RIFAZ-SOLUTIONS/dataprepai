## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

17th   February &amp; 16th  May,  2016

## KIMARO, 3.A.:-

The  respondent is a  limited  liability  company  registered  in Tanzania. Its major activities are exploration, production, distribution and marketing of natural  gas at Songosongo fields in  Lindi  Region. The company operates a gas processing  plant for Songas Limited  under an operatorship agreement. As  part of its  business,  the  respondent also conducts seismic work aimed at  finding  more  gas  and  to  better  understand  the  gas  reservoir. It  drills wells, manages other wells owned by Songas, performs reservoir performance  studies, including geological and geographical, marketing research and other related activities. The above services are  performed  in the United Republic of Tanzania.

The gas produced is supplied to the Songas Plant at Ubungo and  it is used  to  produce  electricity which  is  sold  to Tanzania  Electricity  Supply  Co. (TANESCO). The respondent uses various technical  service  providers both resident  and non-resident  in undertaking its operations. The  services procured fall  into three categories. One, services performed in Tanzania by technical  service  providers based  in Tanzania. Second,  services  performed abroad  by technical service providers who do not come to Tanzania.  Third, technical services performed partly in.Tanzania and partly outside Tanzania.

A dispute arose between the appellant and the respondent in  respect of an omission  by the respondent to withhold tax for technical  fees paid to its  non-resident consultants. Samples were drilled and sent to non-resident consultants in the United Kingdom for analysis and  issuance of report.  This was done and the non-resident consultants paid. In the course of doing an audit  on  the  respondent,  the  appellant  discovered  that  the  respondent omitted to withhold tax on technical fees that was paid to the non-resident

consultants for the analysis of the drilled  samples and  report writing,  work that was done in the United Kingdom. The appellant was of the opinion that since  the  samples  were  drilled  in  Tanzania  and  payment  originated  from Tanzania,  the  respondent was  required  to  withhold  tax  on  such  payment. The  appellant issued a withholding tax certificate to the respondent demanding payment of Tshs.3,640,903,416/=.  The respondent on the other hand  consistently  believed  that  withholding  of tax  on  their  consultants  for work that  was  done  outside  the  country,  in  the  United  Kingdom,  was  not applicable under the Income Tax Act because the services performed by the consultants were done outside the United Republic of Tanzania. The parties failed to  resolve the dispute.

The respondent lodged an appeal  in the Tax Revenue Appeals Board. The Board was divided on its decision.  The majority opinion which included the  Chairman of the  Board  was that payments made  by the  respondent te­ non- resident consultants have a source in Tanzania because the services of the analysis of  the samples  done  in the United Kingdom  cannot  be dissociated  from  the  drilling  activities  that  were  carried  out  in  Tanzania. Further aggrieved, the appellant went to the Tax Appeals Revenue Tribunal.

The Tax  Appeals  Revenue Tribunal  differed  with  the  decision  of the Tax Appeals Board.  It held that the appellant was not liable to withhold tax for the  service  fees  it  paid  to  its  non-resident consultants  abroad  because the work was done in England and the consultants were residents in England. The  Tribunal  relied  on  section  69(i)(i)  of  the  Income  Tax  Act  2004. In support of its decision the Tax Appeals Tribunal relied on the persuasive case of Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy  Industries  V  Director  of  Income T a x , ( 2007) i t r   408  (SC).  The  case  was  decided  in  India. The Tribunal said it was persuasive because section 9(i)(vii) of the Indian Income Tax Act, is  in "pari materiel' with  section  69  of the  Income  Tax  Act,  2004. In  the Indian case, the Supreme Court held that tax is paid for services that are not only utilized  in India  but are rendered  in India.

The Tribunal  was  satisfied  that  since  the  consultants  who  were  paid the service fee were residents in the United Kingdom and the whole work of samples  analysis  was  done  in  England,  the  appellant  was  not  liable  to withhold tax on the sen/ice fees she paid to the consultants.

The appellant was aggrieved by the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal and filed three grounds of appeal:

- 1.  That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by wrongly construing  provisions of section 83(1) (c) of the Income Tax Act, 2004.
- 2 - . That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by wrongly construing provisions of section 69(i)(i) of the Income Tax Act, 2004.
- 3.  That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in Law by holding that the Respondent was not liable to pay the assessed withholding tax.

Before  the  Court,  at  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  the  parties  were represented  by  learned  counsel  Mr.  Juma  Beleko,  assisted  by  Mr.  Adelard Alfred  for  the  appellants  while  the  respondents  were  represented  by  Dr. Kibuta assisted  by Mr.  Wilson  Mukebezi and  Mr.  Fayez Bhojani.

After the filing.of the memorandum of appeal, both parties complied with sub rules (1) and (8) of Rule  106  of the Court of Appeal  Rules 2009 by filing written submissions to support the respective position of the parties in the appeal.

The  learned  counsel  representing  the  parties  adopted  the  respective filed  written  submissions to support their positions.  In clarifying the written submission  in  support of the appeal,  Mr.  Adelard Alfred  learned counsel for the  appellant  said  the  issues the  Court  has to  determine  in  the  appeal  are two:

- (i) Whether or not the payments made by the respondent to non-resident persons are liable to withholding tax.
- (ii) Whether or not the respondent is liable to pay withhold tax not withheld.

The learned  advocate  submitted  correctly that the dispute  has to  be resolved  by a  proper interpretation of sections 69(i)(i) and  section  83(l)(c) of the  Income Tax Act. He said  a  correct  interpretation  of section  69(i)(i) justifies the appellant to demand  payment of the tax that was not withheld by the respondent when it paid the service fee to its consultants abroad.  He opined that a  proper interpretation of section  69(i)(i) would  have been that so  long  as  the  payments  were  made  from  Tanzania  the  place  where  the samples  were  drilled  and  sent  to  the  consultants,  the  place  where  the analysis was done was immaterial.

The  learned  advocate  faulted  the  Tribunal  for  holding  that  section 69(i)(i) does not require the payer to withhold tax when  making payment of service  fee  to  a  non-  resident  payee  stationed  outside Tanzania. He  said that is not a correct interpretation of the section. The learned counsel said what was important for consideration  by the tribunal  was that the services were  delivered  to  a recipient  in the  United Republic  of  Tanzania  and payments were made in consideration of such services.  The payments were therefore subject to withholding of tax under section 83(l)(c).  The learned advocate for the appellant faulted the tribunal for being inconsistent with the principle  of "territorial  nexus" where  tax  liability  is fastened  on  the  income sourced  within  the  geographical  borders  of the  taxing  territory  within  the geographical borders  of  the  taxing  jurisdiction. He  further  blamed  the tribunal for failure to  make a  proper distinction  between a  private company payer  in  section  69(i)(i)  and  government  in  section  69(i)(ii). The  learned advocate concluded that section 69(i) (i)  read with section 83(1) (c) of the Income Tax Act 2004 makes it obvious that so long as the respondent who is a  resident of Tanzania  paid  service fees to  non-  residents  but the  money had source in Tanzania the respondent was obliged by the law under section

•

83(l)(c)to withhold tax for the service fee paid. The learned advocate for the appellant prayed that the appeal be allowed with costs.

Dr.  Kibuta,  learned  advocate  for  the  respondent  conceded  with  the learned advocate for the appellant on the issues the Court has to resolve in this  appeal. His  counter  submissions  are  that  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  decided the appeal  fairly. He cited  sections  6(1),  6(2)  69  (and  in particular 69(i) (i)) and 83(1) (c) and said the conclusive effect is that -

- " 5 5 long as there  were activities being performed in the United Republic (partly or wholly) to accomplish the contract service; then payment made for such services have as source in  the United Republic  and accordingly  the  whole  of such payment should be subjected to  withholding tax scheme  as required by section  83(1  )(b)  (See section  TAB  3)  o f the  Income  Act, Cap.  332  [as amended].

The learned counsel after being satisfied that the words perform  and render, have the same meaning, came to a conclusion for services rendered outside Tanzania  under section  69(i)(i) the source  rule would  not apply. It would only apply if the government is the payer under sections and 69(i)(ii). Otherwise there would have been no need to have the two subsections which are drafted differently. He said  in terms of section  83(l)(c)and  69(i)(i) the respondent  had  no  obligation  to  pay  withholding  tax  on  the  payments  it made  to  non-residents  for  services  performed  outside  Tanzania. That obligation  would  only arise  where the  services are  rendered  /performed  in Tanzania.  He further said that subjecting the income of non-resident service providers to tax by way of withholding tax in Tanzania is contrary to tax laws and internationally accepted tax norms.  He cited the case of Ishikawajima -Harima  Heavy  Industries  Limited (supra)  which  gives  the  position  in India  prior  to  the  amendment  of  the  law  in  2010,  a  position  which  still prevails  in  Tanzania.  Section  9(l)(vii)  (c)  of the  India  Income Tax  Act is categorical  that for  non-residents  to  be  taxed  on  income  of services,  such services  needs to be rendered within India and has to be part of the business or profession-carried out by such  person in India.

The learned counsel said the position in India  has now changed.  The case of Ashapura Minichem Ltd V ADIT [ITA No. 2508/Mum/08 cited by the learned counsel decided after the amendment of the Income Tax law

in  India  makes  it  clear  that  service  fees  paid  to  non-residents  for  service rendered without necessarily being  performed  in India are deemed to  have source in  India. As regards the submission  made  by the  learned advocate for the appellant that laxity  in  interpreting  section  69(i)(i) to the effect that services  performed  outside Tanzania  although  paid  from Tanzania  have  no source in Tanzania will encourage tax evaders  and evasion; create discrimination  among  tax  payers;  and  deprive  government  revenue,  the learned counsel said such a thinking is not lawyer like. He urged the Court, being the highest  of  the Land, to give a proper  effect  to what  the Government had intended by enacting such law and to avoid putting into the provision  what the government had  not thought of. He cited  the  case  of Cape Brandly Syndicate V IRC (1921) K B64 which  reminded the courts to  have  a  trite  principle  of strict  interpretation  of tax  statutes.  The  iearned counsel  cited Commissioner General  and  another V  Mac Arthur and Baker Internationa! [1999]  L.L.R.  (CAT);[2000]1E.A.33  to  reminded the Court of  the approach  it took in  having a strict interpretation of the statues. Another case  he  relied  on  also  on  the  same  subject  matter  is  the  case  of Hon.  Attorney  General  and  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  Parastatal Pensions  Fund  V  Nasoro  Athunaman  Gogo  and  Sessy  William

Lugiana Consolidated Appeals No.  105 and 81 of 2006 (unreported) where the  Court  held  that the  rule  of construction  is "to  intend  the  legislature  to have meant what they have actually expressed".  He reiterated that the Tax Appeal  Revenue Tribunal  made no error in  its decision. He prayed that the appeal be dismissed with costs.

In  brief  rejoinder  both  Mr.  Beleko  and  Mr.  Alfred  reiterated  that  the source  rule  applies  for  services  fees  paid  to  non-residents  consultants  for sample  analysis  and  report  writing  because  the  samples  were  drilled  in Tanzania and the payment was made from Tanzania.

On our part we agree with the issues framed by the parties that they a rp&gt; f h p n n p r r&gt;+* f h o 1 * C * C ^ ^ H  P T O  ^ ! Ci  iv ^ w ' i j ^ \_ i i · 'w .  V   C-i  i i  c I  U i \_\_W  i  V  1  i i ^ L i f w C-i j\_\_^  | \_I LJ i w  i  ' w U w i i w l - D G j-/ C i \3 i  i  L i. 1 i C L fUrv r - \-\ j - \   v~ / v ik\ / - l v  r s   ~ v »   / v k &gt; /\r -  '  4 k ~ / ~ \ i / ~ \ y / ~ \ r '   i   A s v - \ 4 -liic pai u c s a i c i n a y i c c i M c i i i i D a t i   G b p O i i u c i   ilo c u y a y c u n u i r l O i u c i i L consultants  to  render  services  of analysis  of sample  drilled  from  Tanzania and  write a  report in. relation  to  gas exploration. There is  no dispute that the  respondent paid for the services. There  is also  no dispute that in  the process  of  making  payment  the  respondent  did  not  withhold  tax  for  the payment it made to the non-resident consultants. This brings us to the first issue agreed upon  by the parties in this appeal. That is whether or not the payments made by the respondent to the non-resident persons are liable to · 1 1

withholding tax.  The parties through their advocates agreed that chargeable income  of non-resident is  regulated  by section  6(b)  of the  Income Tax Act which provides:

"//7 case o f  non-resident  person,  the person's income from the employment; business or investment for the year  o f  income, only  to  the  extent  that  the income has source  in  the  United Republic of Tanzania."

Section 83(l)(c) on the other hand imposes an obligation for withholding tax on payments to non-residents.  The section reads:

" Subject to  subsection  (2),  a  resident person  who pays a service fee or insurance premium with a source in the United  Republic  to a non­ resident  person shall withhold  income tax from the payment at the rate provided for in paragraph 4(c) o f  the First  Schedule."

Did  the  service  fee  that  the  respondent  paid  to  the  non-  resident consultants have source in Tanzania?  The answer is found  in section  69 of the Income Tax Act. Section 69(i)(i) provides as follows:

" The following payments have a source in the United

Republic:

- (i) Payments including service fee, o f  a type not mentioned in paragraphs (g) or (h) or attributable to employment exercised, service rendered or a forbearance from exercising employment or rendering service -
- (i) in the United Republic, regardless o f the place o f  payment; or

'

■

- ( i i ) vzhere the payer is the Government o f the United Republic\ irrespective o f  the place o f  exercise, rendering o f forbearance.  "

Payments  in  paragraphs  (g)  of  section  69  are  related  to  payments received  by a  person who conducts a  business of land, sea,  or air transport

'

operator,  or charterer in  respect of carriage of passengers,  who embark on cargo,  mail,  or  other  movable  tangible  assets  that  are  embarked  in  the United Republic  other  than  as  a result  of  transshipment  or rental of containers and  related equipment which are supplementary or incidental to carriage  referred  to  in  subparagraph  (i). Payments  in  paragraph  (h)  are those received by  a person  who  conducts  a business  of  transmitting messages by cable, radio, optical fibre or satellite or electronic communication in respect of transmission of messages by apparatus established  in the  United  Republic whether or  not such  messages originate in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania. The  cited  paragraph  (g)  and  (h)  of section  69  are only  relevant for purposes of showing  what other  payments is subject to payment of income tax which is spoken of in section  69(i)(i).

In this appeal  what is at issue  is the  payment of service fees  paid  by the respondent  to non-resident  consultants. As  already  indicated  the respondent did not withhold tax for the said payment.  Was the respondent liable  for  withholding  such  income  tax? Dr.  Kabuta  says  no  she  was  not because  the  services  were  not  rendered  in  the  United Republic. The appellant agrees that the services were  not rendered  in Tanzania  but says the  services were  rendered  in  connection  to samples drilled  from Tanzania

and  payment made in Tanzania. That is actually what took place  but with respect to the learned advocates for the appellant, we do not think that they have  grasped  the  real  meaning  of section  69(i)(i)  of the  Income Tax  Act. The  section  is  clear  that  income  tax  is  chargeable  for  service  fee received for services rendered in Tanzania.  What is stressed in the section is that the services must be rendered in Tanzania. This could be  a leeway  for  tax  evasion  for  unfaithful  businessmen  or  for  unlawful transactions. All the same the Court is bound to interpret the law in its true perspective. The  cases  of Cape  Brandy  Syndicate (supra)  and  that  of Commissioner General Another V Mac Arthur and baker International(supra) guide the court on interpretation of the statutes.  We cannot  create  a  situation in the  statute  that  was  not  intended  by  the Legislature.  Section 69(i)(i) makes a distinction between payments made by an  individual  person and that made  bv the aovernment under section  69fn J I l \_' V (ii). Where the government is the payer, income tax is chargeable regardless of the place where the services are rendered. It is chargeable even when it is  rendered  outside the  United  Republic. This  is  not the  case  with  section 69(i)(i).  A private company like the respondent has no obligation to withhold tax  where  the  services  fee  paid  were  for  services  rendered  outside  the

country. We think that the best way to remedy the situation of allowing loss of income to the government is to amend the law to cater for such situations as it happened in this case.  Other jurisdictions, like the government of India changed the law and is now in a position to charge income even for services rendered  outside  India  but  payment  made  in  India. See  the  case  of Ashapura Minishem Ltd (supra).

Having  given  our  views  on  what  we  consider  to be  the proper interpretation  of the  law  relevant  in  our case  at  hand,  we  proceed  now  to answer  the  grounds  of  appeal raised. The  first  ground related  to  the construction of  section 83(1) (c) of  the Income  Tax  Act  that  it  was erroneously construed  by the Tax Appeals Tribunal. In  our respectful view we do  not think so. The construction  of the  section  was tied  to the  place where  the  services  for  the respondent  were  rendered. Services  were rendered  in  United  Kingdom  by  persons  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom. Section  69(i)(i)  does  not  impose  a  liability  on  an  individual  company  to withhold tax where service fee is paid in relation to services rendered out of the  United  Republic  regardless  of  the  fact  that  payment  is  made  by  a company  registered  in  and  is  doing  business  in  Tanzania. The  situation would  have  been  different  if the  respondent  was  government. This  also

-

answers  the  issues  that,  were  raised  by  the  parties  that  the  payments  that were  made  by  the  respondent  to  non-resident  consultants  vveie  not  liable for withholding tax. Since the payments were not liable for withholding  tax, the respondents are not: liable for payment of the tax that  was withheld. We recommend  to  the  Attorney  General  as  the  Advisor  of  the  Government  to look  into  the  possibility  of amendment of the  law to  remove  leeway  for  loss on  income  to  the  government  as  it  will  be  found  appropriate. We  dismiss the appeal  but we make no order for costs.

DATED  at DAR ES SALAAM   this 9th  day of May 2016.
