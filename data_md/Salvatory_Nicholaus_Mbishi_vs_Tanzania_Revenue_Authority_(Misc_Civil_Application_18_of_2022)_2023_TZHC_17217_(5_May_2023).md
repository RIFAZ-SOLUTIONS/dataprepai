## RULING

Last Order: 31s t March,2023

Date of Ruling: 5th  May, 2023

## MASABO, J.:-

The  applicant  being  aggrieved  by  a   decision  of the  Court  of the  Resident Magistrate for Moshi in C ivil Case N o . l of 20 2 2 , is desirous of appealing to this court. As the time within which to file the appeal has lapsed, he has moved this  court  for  leave  to  file his  appeal  out  of  time.  The  application is accompanied  by  an  affidavit  he  has  personally  deponed  in  which  the following background  to  the  application and  the reasons  thereto  are discerned. That, his suit was dismissed on  11/8/2022 after the court upheld a preliminary objection raised by the respondent asserting that the court was not clothed with jurisdiction to entertain the suit. After the dismissal of the appeal,  he was  not timely furnished  with  a  copy  of the  ruling  and  drawn order. In spite of several followups, he was not furnished with the same until on 8/11/2022.  By then, the duration within which to lodge an appeal to this court had  lapsed  hence the  present application  which  is  premised  on  only

one  ground,  namely  delay  in  being  furnished  with  the  ruling  and  drawn order. The respondent, through a counter affidavit deponed by one Marcely Costantine  Kanoni  who  is  identified  as  its  legal  counsel,  contested  the application and put the applicant to strict proof.

Hearing of the application proceeded in writing. Convincing the court to hold in the applicant's favour,  Ms. Justus, the applicant's counsel, submitted that the  application  is  well  founded  as  there  is  a  good  cause  within  which  to enlarge the time for filing the appeal. The applicant is not to blame for the delay  as  he  was  diligently  pursuing  his  right  and  the  delay  was  wholly occasioned  by the trial  court as it delayed  in furnishing  him with the ruling and drawn order even after close follow ups. As a result, there was nothing that he could  do  in  pursuit of his  right timely.  In  fortification  of  her  point, Ms. Justus  cited the  case  of Transcontinental  Forwarders  Ltd  vs Tanganyika  Motors  Ltd [1997]  T.L.R  328, Mohsin  Mohamed  Taki Abdalla vs Tariq Mirza &amp; Others, Civil Application  No.  100 of 2019, CAT at Dar es Salaam (unreported) in which it was held that all what the applicant had to do was to request for the copy of ruling/order and it was not his duty to remind  the  registry. He  further  cited  the  case  of Ngoni-Matengo Cooperative  Marketing  Union  Ltd  v  Alimohamed  Osman [1962]  1 E.A1 where the court held that the applicant should not be condemned by a mistake  done  by  the  registry  which  supplied  him  with  a  wrongly  dated decree.  Based  on  these  authorities,  she  prayed  that  the  application  be allowed and the leave be granted.

In his reply submission,  Mr.  Brian William  Magoma,  learned State Attorney, refereed  the  court  the  decision of  the Court  of  Appeal  in Lyamuya Construction Company Ltd v Board of Trustees of Young Women's Christian Association of Tanzania, Civil Application No. 2 of 2010, where it  stated  the  factors  for  consideration  in  determining  an  application  for extension of time. He proceeded that section 14 of the Law of Limitation Act [Cap 89 RE 2019] vests this court with discretion in enlargement of time but the discretion  need  be judiciously exercised.  He then  referred this court to the provision of section 19(2) of the Law of Limitation Act which provides for exclusion  of  the  duration  during  which  the  applicant  was  waiting  to  be furnished  with  a  copy  of the  ruling  and  argued  that,  when  this  period  is excluded,  it  will  follow  that,  only  15  days  had  lapsed  when  the  applicant instituted this application.  Impliedly, therefore, the time within which to file the  appeal  had  not  lapsed  when  this  application  was  filed.  Fortifying  this point,  he  cited  decisions  of the  Court  of Appeal  in Mohamed Salimin v Jummane Omary Mapesa, Civil  Appeal  No.  345 of 2019, Alex Senkoro &amp; Others v Elimbuya Lyimo, Civil Appeal No.  16 of 2017 and Methusela Enoka v National Microfinance Bank Ltd, Civil Appeal  No.  266 of 2019 all  of which  held  in  favour of automatic exclusion  of the time within  which the applicant was waiting to be furnished with the ruling and drawn order. However, he argued that the present application should not be granted as it was filed prematurely and the applicant has wasted his time in pursuit of the current application which was unnecessary.

In rejoinder, the  applicant's  counsel, cited a decision  of  this  court  in Tanzania Assurance Co, Ltd &amp; Another vs Richard Augustine Zuberi, Civil  Appeal  No.  129  of 2019  and  argued that,  the exclusion of time  under section  19  (2)  is  not  automatic.  Hence,  it  was  crucial  for  him  to  seek  for leave for extension of time

I have considered the submissions by both parties. The application being for extension  of  time  has  only  one  issue  for  determination,  namely  whether there is a good cause for extension of time. Before I address this issue, I will start with a preliminary issue raised in the submissions. In her submission in chief,  the  respondent's  counsel  has  prayed  that  the  affidavit  should  be expunged from the record as it appears to have been filed in Dar es Salaam. With  much  respect to  the  learned  State  Attorney,  I  will  not entertain  this issue as it was improperly raised in the course of written submission. Besides, even  if it was  properly  raised,  it would  definitely fail  as  it appears to  be  a mere clerical error curable by the principle of overriding objective enshrined under section 3A and 38B of the Civil Procedure Code [Cap 33 RE 2019].

Having resolved the above issue, I now turn to Mr.  Magoma's submission as regards  whether  this  application  was  properly  filed.  The  learned  State Attorney  has  argued  that,  the  present  application  was  prematurely  filed because the  duration  within  which  to  appeal  to  this  court  had  not  lapsed when  the  applicant  filed  the  present  application  in  court.  Cementing  his argument, he has argued that, the duration within which to appeal from the Court of the Resident Magistrate to this court is 30 days.  He has further,  in

fortification, cited the provision of section  19(2) of the Law of Limitation Act which  provides  for  exclusion  of  the  days  within  which  the  applicant  was waiting to be furnished with the copy of the ruling.  Based on this provision he  has argued that,  when the days within which the applicant was waiting to be furnished with the ruling are excluded, it will follow that, the duration of  30  days  had  not  lapsed  when  this  application  was  filed.  Thus,  the application was improperly filed as the applicant was within time and needed not to file the present application.

In  my considered view, the submission by Mr.  Magoma  resonates well with the law as it currently stands. As the submissions prominently exhibit,  both parties are at one that, the ruling sought to be challenged was delivered on 11/8/2022 but its copy was furnished on the applicant on 8/11/2022 and 6 days  later  on  14/11/2022,  he  instituted  the  present  application.  Section 19(2) of the Law of Limitation Act which Mr. Magoma has cited in support of submission states thus;

19.-(2) In computing the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal, an application for leave to appeal, or an application for review of judgment, the day on which the judgment complained of was delivered, and the period of time requisite for obtaining  a  copy of the decree or order appealed from or sought to be reviewed, shall be excluded.

The essence of this  provision  can  be easily  understood  when  it  is  read  in conjunction  with  the  provisions  of Order  XXXIX  Rule  1   of Civil  Procedure Code  [Cap  33  RE  2019],  which  mandatorily  requires  that  appeals  from subordinate  courts  (district  courts  and  courts  of  resident  magistrate)  be

accompanied by a copy of the decision appealed against. It is in this context, section  19(2) of the Law of Limitation Act is coined to protect the appellant who would otherwise be wrongly condemned for a delay wholly occasioned by the court's failure to furnish him with the copy of judgment, ruling, decree or drawn  order,  as the  case  in  point. Interpreting  the  above  provision  in Alex Senkoro, the Court of Appeal stated that;

"We entertain  no doubt that the above sub-sections expressly allow  automatic  exclusion  of the  period  of time  requisite  for obtaining a copy of the decree or judgment appealed from the computation of  the prescribed limitation period. Such an exclusion  need  not  be  made  upon  an  order of the  court in  a formal application for extension of time."

Also, the Court took the same stance in Methuselah Enoka (supra), where it  did  not  only  acknowledge  the  automatic  exclusion  but  also  stated  that there is no need for a separate application nor according any attachment to a memorandum of appeal.

In  the  instant  application,  both  parties  agree  that the  ruling  sought to  be challenged  was  delivered  on  11/8/2022  but its copy was furnished  on  the applicant on  8/11/2022  and  6  days  later on  14/11/2022,  he  instituted  the present  application.  Therefore,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that,  as  correctly submitted by the learned State Attorney, when these facts are applied to the authorities above, it becomes  too  obvious that this application was prematurely filed as at its institution, only 6 days had  lapsed from the date of the obtainment of the copy of the ruling, a date from which the duration within  which  to  appeal  is  reckoned.  The  present application  was therefore

superfluous considering also that the decision  sought to be challenged  is a decision  of  the  Court  of  the  Resident  Magistrate  exercising  its  original jurisdiction whose time limit is within the realm of item 1  of the Part II of the Schedule to the Law of Limitation Act which  provides for a time limit of 90 days which reckoned from 8/11/2022 lapsed on 5/2/2023.

Mr. Magoma  has  argued  me  to  hold  that,  the  applicant  has  lost  the opportunity to file his appeal as he has wasted his statutory time loitering in court in pursuit of a superfluous application.  Much as it is true that the time within which to file the appeal has lapsed and the said time was spent while pursuing the present application, it will be unjust to condemn and punish the applicant  who has been  diligently prosecuting  the present  application mistakenly believing that,  he was legally obliged  so.  It is in  my considered view that the delay occasioned while pursuing this application is a technical one and excusable as he has diligently pursued his right in this court.

Accordingly,  the  applicant  is  granted  a  leave  of  20  days  within  which  to appeal  against the  ruling  of the  trial  court.  The  costs  are to  be  shared  by each of the parties shouldering its respective costs.

DATED at DELIVERED at MOSHI this 5th  day of May 2023.
