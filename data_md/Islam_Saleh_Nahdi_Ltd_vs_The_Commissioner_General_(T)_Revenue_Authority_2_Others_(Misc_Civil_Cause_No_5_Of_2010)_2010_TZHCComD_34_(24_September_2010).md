## RULING

## MAKARAMBA, J.:

This is a  ruling  on  reserved  reasons on  the  Preliminary Objection  the Respondents  raised  against  the  Applicant's  application  for  leave  to  apply for prorogated orders out of time, which was lodged in this Court on the 7 th day of July 2010.  On  the  13 th   day of August when  Counsel  for the  parties made  oral  submissions  on  the  preliminary  objection,  this  Court  dismissed

the application with costs and  reserved  reasons for a  later date. These are the  reasons for the order to dismiss the application  with  costs on  the  13 th day of August 2010.

On  13 th day  of  August  2010, Mr. Malata learned  State  Attorney appeared  for  the  Respondents. He  was  assisted by  Mr.  Tito, learned Counsel  for the  1 st Respondent.  Mr.  Kinguji  learned  Counsel  appeared  for the Applicant.

The background to the matter is that on the 7 th  day of May 2010, the Applicant  filed  in  this  Court  an  application  by  way  of  Chamber  Summons under section  14(1) of the Law of  Limitation Act [Cap.89 R.E.  2010, section 18(1) of the Law Reform (Fatal  Accidents and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act [Cap.310  R.E.  2002],  section  68(e)  and  95  of  the Civil  Procedure  Code [Cap.33  R.E.  2002]  and  any  other  enabling  provisions  of the  law,  for the following orders:

- 1. This Honourable Court be pleased to extend time within which to make this application for leave.
- 2. That this Honourable Court may be pleased to grant leave to the applicant to file an application for:-
- (a) Orders of certiorari to  remove  from  this  Honourable  Court and quash  the decision  for seizure and forfeiture given  by the  1 st and 2 nd   Respondents  dated  ld h day  of February, 2005 and 23 d  day of  February, 2005.

- (b) Orders of  mandamus directing and ordering -
- (i) The 1 st  and 2 nd  Respondents to act according to law (ii)The  1 st and 2 nd   Respondents to restore  to  the Applicant the  vehicle  with  registration  No. T660 ABF and the trailer bearing No. T  130 ABF.
- (c)For an order of  prohibition to prohibit and or desist the 1 st  and 2 nd Responndents from carrying out the threat of disposing of  the vehicle  and  trailer  stated  at  paragraph  2  (b)(ii) hereinabove;
- (d) That Costs of this application be granted to the Applicant
- (e) Any other and further reiief(s)  that  the  Honourable  Court may deem just and fit to grant.

The  Application  has  been  made  out  at  the  instance  of  Kinguji  &amp; Company,  Advocates  and  is  supported  by  the  Affidavit  of  TALAL  ISLAM SALEH together with statement of the Applicant annexed to the Application and  further  grounds  and reasons  adduced  during  the  hearing  of  the Application.

On the 22 nd  day of June  2010,  the  Respondents jointly filed  a  Notice of  Preliminary  Objection  that  on  the  first  hearing  of  the  Application  they shall  raised a  Preliminary Objection on a  point of law that the Application is hopelessly out of time.

Mr. Malata submitting on the preliminary objection that the application  hopelessly  time  barred  argued  that  the  Application  which  is seeking to  challenge the decision  made  by  1 st   and  2 nd Respondents dated 16/02/2005  as  reflected in prayer  one in the Chamber  Summons,  is hopelessly  out  of  time.  Mr.  Malata  submitted  further  that  the  time  limit within  which  to  file  for  leave  for  such  orders  is  six  months  as  per  section 19(2)  and  (3)  Law Reform  (Fatal Accidents and Miscellaneous Provisions) /let [Cap.310  R.E.  2002].  Mr.  Malata submitted further that if the Applicant failed to file the Application within  six months he could apply for extension of  time  in  the  next  six  months  making  it  twelve  months,  the  time  limit within  which  Applicant  could  make  the  Application.  Mr.  Malata  submitted further that beyond that the time this Court cannot  entertain such application.  Mr.  Malata  submitted  further  that  since  the  Applicant  did  not act  immediately  within  that  prescribed  time  he  cannot  be  heard  at  this time.  Mr.  Malata  elaborating submitted further that the present Application was  filed  in  this  Court  on  07/05/2010  and  counting  from  the  date  of the decision  the  subject  of  this  application,  it  brings  it  to  almost  five  years, which  is  beyond  the  time  limit  provided in the  law  within  which  the Applicant  could  have  filed  for  extension  of  time. Mr. Malata  submitted further  that  this  period  is  beyond  the  twelve  months  provided  in  the  law within  which  to  file  for  application  extension. Making  reference  to  the decision of  the Court  of  Appeal of  Tanzania in NBC  LIMITED  VS.

PARTNERS  CONSTRUCTION  CO.  LTD. Civil  Appeal  No.  34/2003 (Dsm) (unreported),  Mr.  Malata  submitted  that  in  that  decision  it  was  to the effect that the Civil  Procedure Code provide for 21 days within which to

file Written Statement of Defence and if the Defendant has failed to file the Written Statement of Defence within the  21  days provided  by law then  he has to file for extension to file within the 21 days which makes a total of 42 days.  Mr.  Malata  submitted  further  that  the  Court  while  referring  to  the proviso to Order VIII  Rule  1(2) which allows for enlargement of time to be made after the expiration of the 21 days when the defendant is required to file his written statement of defence, the Court (Kaji, JA) observed thus

"The meaning of this, in our view, is that,  when the defendant fails to file written  statement  of defence  within  the  prescribed period  of twenty-one  days,  he may apply for extension  of time,  provided he does so within twenty-one days from the expiration of the prescribed period of twenty-one days. If  he does so more than twenty one days, his application  cannot be  entertained.  The  rationale  behind it is  to limit  the  discretion  of the  court  to  extend  time  within  which  the defendant can file a written statement of  defence as was held by this Court in TANZANIA HARBOURS AUTHORITY VS. MOHAMED R. MOHAMED Civil Appeal No.80 o f1999 (unreported."

Mr.  Malata  relying  on  the  reasoning  in  that  decision  submitted  that section  19  (2)  and  (3)  of Law Reform (Fatal Accidents and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act [Cap.310  R.E.  2002]  provides  for  the  time  limit  for  filing application  for  leave  to  file  application  for  prerogative  orders  to  be  within six  months and since the Applicant has failed to file such application within six  months  then  by  analogy,  since  the  Applicant  has  failed  to  apply  for

extension of time within the next six months after the expiration of the first six  months, then  he cannot be heard  in this application and this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this Application.

Mr.  Malata submitted further that the cited case applies for extension of time after expiration of time limit for applications and hence it is relevant to  the  case  at  hand  and  in  that decision,  the  Court of Appeal  of Tanzania gave  its  rationale which  is to  limit the  discretion  of the  Court,  considering that  matters  of  extension  of  time  are  a  discretion  of  the  court  upon  the applicant applying for extension,  which  discretion  has the  limit which  was expressed  in  that  cited  case  and  therefore  in  the  present  case,  the  court has  been  limited  to  extend  time  to  file  application  for  leave.  Mr.  Malata prayed  that  the  application is hopelessly  out  of  time  and should be dismissed.

Mr.  Kinguji in reply submitted that the Preliminary Objection has no merit at  all  and  it  appears  that  the  learned  State  Attorney  is  not  aware  of this matter since the matter started  in  2005.  Mr.  Kinguji  submitted further that the Applicant filed  an  application  No. 19/2007  praying  for the  same orders and  in  his  ruling on  08/05/2009,  Hon.  Justice  Mruma  of this Court granted the  applicant  leave  to  apply  for  prerogative  orders.  Mr.  Kinguji  conceded that unfortunately instead of filing the application they had gone one stage ahead.  Mr.  Kinguji  submitted  further  that  on  14/12/2009,  the  application was  struck  out  by  Justice  Makaramba  of  this  Court  and  it  is  from  this application  which  they  filed  praying  for  extension  of  time  starting  from 14/12/2009  when  time  begun  to  run  and  not  from  2005  as  the  learned

State  Attorney  has  submitted.  Mr.  Kinguji  submitted  further that they  are still  within  time and technicalities should  not be  used  to defeat justice and prayed  the  Preliminary  Objection  to  be  dismissed  with  costs  for  lack  of merits.

Mr.  Malata  rejoining  differed  with  Mr.  Kinguji  and  submitted  that  the application  before this  Court which  was filed  on  07/05/2010  is seeking  for among  others  prayers  for  leave  to  be  granted  to  the  applicant to  file  an application  for  prerogative  orders.  The date for reckoning the time  limit is from the date the first application  was struck out which  is on  14/12/2009. Mr.  Malata  insisted that the Applicant is not challenging the decision of this Court dated  14/12/2009 as there is no decision which was made by 1 st  and 2 nd Respondent on  14/12/2009 sought to be challenged, which would have rendered the Preliminary Objection inoperative or misconceived.  Mr.  Malata submitted  further  that  even  the  application  No. 19/2002  was  also  out  of time. Mr. Malata  submitted  further  that  counting  from  February  2005, when the decisions sought to  be challenged were  handed  down  by the  1 st and 2 nd Respondents,  twelve  months  expired in February 2006.  The application  for extension  of time was therefore filed  beyond  the time  limit prescribed  by the  law  and  in  terms  of section  3  of  Law  of  Limitation  Act [Cap.89  R.E.  2001],  a  matter  brought out of the  prescribed  time  is  to  be dismissed.

I  have  carefully followed  the  submissions  by Counsel  for the  Parties.  It seems  to  me  that  the  Applicant  has  brought  an  application  seeking  for extension  of  time  within  which  to  make  application  for  leave  to  file  for prerogative  orders.  This  is  what  seems  to  have  attracted  the  preliminary

objection  by the Respondents that the application is hopelessly out of time. There  is  however,  a  ruling  of  this  Court  by  Mruma,  J  which  was  handed down  on  08/05/2009,  granting  the  Applicant  extension  of  time  to  file application for leave for prerogative orders. Whether the present application  was  also  out  of time  is  therefore  no  longer  of  moment  and  in any  event  this  Court  cannot  sit  in  review  of  that  decision.  The  present application  is  in  my view  no  longer  about whether extension  of time  must have been made during the period of six months.

It  is  on record  that  Hon.  Mruma  J.,  of  this  Court  in  his  ruling  dated 08/05/2009  granted  the  Applicant  extension  of  time  for  application  for leave  for  prerogative  orders.  It  is  also  on  record  that  on  the  28/05/2009, the Applicant filed  in  this  Court  application  for  an  order  that this  Court  be pleased to issue prerogative orders of certiorari,  mandamus and  prohibition to remove  into  this  Court  and  quash  the  decision  of  the 1 st and  2 nd Respondents  dated 16 th February  2005  and 23 rd February  2005.  This Application  also  attracted  a  preliminary  objection  from  the  3 rd   Respondent on  a point  of  law  that  the  application  was  fatally  defective  for  being prematurely  before this  Court and  on  the  29 th   day  of September  2009  the 1 st and 2 nd   Respondents also raised three points of preliminary objection on the Application. The Application was stuck out by this Court on  14/12/2009 on  among  other  reasons that  it  had  overstepped  the  procedure  by  having been  brought  prematurely  for  prerogative  orders  instead  of  first  applying for  leave to  apply for  prerogative  orders as  required  by  law.  The Applicant have  now come  back to this Court and  by this Application  which  was filed on  05/07/2010 they are seeking for extension of time within which to make

this  application  for  leave  and  for  grant  of  leave  to  file  an  application  for prerogative.  The  Applicant  are  still  minded  to  challenge  decisions  handed down  by the  1 st and  2 nd Defendants on the  16 th   day of February  2005  and 23 rd day of February 2005 respectively.

In the course of the hearing of the application this Court put a question across to the learned Counsel for the Applicant as to the effect of the ruling of this Court dated  14/12/2009 striking out the application,  whether it had cancelled  ruling  of  Hon.  Justice  Mruma  dated  08/05/2009  granting  the Applicant  extension of  time  to  file application for leave  to apply  for prerogative  orders.  Mr. Kinguji  responded  that  the  ruling  of  this  Court dated  14/12/2009 striking  out the Application did  not cancel out the  ruling Justice  Mruma  dated  08/05/2009 granting  the Applicant extension  of time to  file  application  for  leave  to  apply  for  prerogative  orders.  It  is  baffling therefore why the learned Counsel for the Applicant has not abided  by the ruling  of  Hon.  Justice  Mruma  granting  the  Applicant  extension  of time  to file  application  for  leave  to  apply  for  prerogative  orders,  instead  he  has come  back  to  this  Court  seeking  yet  for  extension  of  time.  Mr.  Kinguji conceded  that  they  went  astray  by  not  abiding  by  that  the  ruling  of this Court  dated  08/05/2009  by  bringing  in  this  Court the  present  application where they are seeking extension of time to make the application for leave and for grant of leave to file application  for  leave to apply for  prerogative orders.  In  any  event  calculating  the  time  which  has  elapsed  from  the 08/05/2009  when  the  Applicant  was  granted  extension  of  time  to  bring application  for  leave  to  apply  for  prerogative  orders  to  the  07/05/2010 when they filed the present application it is almost a year and  no sufficient

reasons  have  been  advanced  by  the  Applicant  to  the  satisfaction  of  this Court for such delay.

The  Applicant has not abided by the ruling of this Court dated 08/05/2009 granting  the Applicant extension  of time to file  application  for leave  to apply  for prerogative  orders. Worse  still they have lumped together  application  for  extension  of  time  to  make  application  for  leave together with application for leave to file application for prerogative orders. It is therefore as good as they have not applied for leave to file application for prerogative orders.

In  the  event  and  for  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Application  is  hereby dismissed with costs. Order accordingly.
