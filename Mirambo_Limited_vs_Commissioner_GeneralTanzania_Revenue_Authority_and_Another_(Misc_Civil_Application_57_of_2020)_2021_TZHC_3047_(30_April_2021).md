## RULING

## FELESHI. J.K.:

This  is  an  application  for  an  extension  of time  to  file  an  application for  leave  to  file  an  application  for  prerogative  orders  of certiorari and mandamus out of time;  an  order that the costs of the application abide to the  outcome of the  intended  application  and/or for the  application  of the aforesaid  orders;  and, for any other order(s) the  Court  may deem  fit and just to grant.

The  applicant  filed  this  application  by  way  of  chamber  summons under section  14(1)  of the  Law of Limitation Act,  Cap.  89  [R.E.2019]  and

1st RESPONDENT

2nd RESPONDENT

Rule  17 of the  Law  Reform  (Fatal  Accidents and  Miscellaneous  Provisions) (Judicial  Review Procedure and Fees) Rules, vide G.N.  No. 324 of 2014 and the  same  is  supported  by  an  affidavit  affirmed  by  one  Bikash  Subba,  the applicant's Principal officer and Company Secretary.

Mr.  Bikash Subba asserted that, in 2017, the applicant herein entered ; into  negotiations with Vodacom  Group Limited for purchase of shares held by the applicant in Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company. That, in the course of negotiations,  some issues and communications were determined with  some agreements signed towards the intended deal.  For that matter, on  28/08/2019,  the  1s t   respondent  issued a  Tax  Clearance  Certificate paving  way for the applicant and Vodacom Group Limited to proceed with settlement  processes  for  completion  of share  transfer  in  compliance  with the  Capital Markets  and  Securities  Authorities (CMSA)  with  the  same scheduled to be completed by 23/09/2019.

In  the course thus, two private  rulings were entered, that is,  1 s t  and 2n d   private  rulings.  However,  on  21/09/2019  that  is,  two  days  before  the scheduled  deadline,  the  applicant  received  a  notice  of  revocation  of  the latter entered 2n d private ruling vide 1s t respondent's letter dated

20/09/2019.  Efforts to  review that revocation were made whereas to-date, the  1 s t  respondent has not acted on the applicant's notices of objection and application for administrative review of the revoked 2n d  private ruling.

According to the deponent, the cause of delay in making an application for the intended  leave to seek prerogative remedies before this Court was caused  by the  unattended  steps taken  by the applicant that  is, the notices of objection she lodged within 30 days from the date of service of the 1s t respondent's decision followed by her application for administrative review.

That,  from  the  date  of filing  of the  notices  of objection,  that  is,  on 18/10/2019  up  to  09/05/2020,  the  applicant  has  been  waiting  for  the  1 s t respondent's  determination  on  the  preferred  notices  of objection  and  his further  application  for  administrative review  whereas  to-date,  she  not received any response. She further sought intervention of the 2n d respondent vide her two letters addressed to  him  which to-date  have also not been acted upon.

The  deponent  further  stated  that,  the  applicant's  grievances  have bases also from the evident illegalities and improprieties remediable

through judicial review. The deponent added that, the reluctance by the  1s t respondent to determine her notices of objection against the  revocation of 2n d private  ruling  and  issuance  of  agency  notice  adversely  affected  the applicant's operational, economic and welfare, hence, the present application.

On  4th   January, 2021, Mr.  Ayoub  Gervas  Sanga  -  learned  State Attorney raised two points of preliminary objection to wit, that: -

- 1.  The application  is  bad  and  untenable  in  law for failure to exhaust available remedy.
- 2.  The  application  is  incompetent  in  law  for  being  brought  under wrong provisions.

On  27th   day  of  January,  2021,  Mr.  Sanga  added  another  point  of preliminary objection to wit that, this Honourable  Court  has no jurisdiction to entertain the matter.

On 09/02/2021  Mr.  Deodatus  Nyoni,  learned  Principal  State Attorney assisted  by  Ms.  Rehema  Mtulya,  learned State Attorney opted and as such withdrew  the 1s t preliminary  objection  in  the 1s t limb  and  this  Court scheduled a simultaneous hearing of both the raised two sets of

preliminary  objection  and  merits  of the  application.  The  parties  complied with the schedule, hence, this ruling.

Furthermore,  in  the  course  of  hearing,  Mr.  Gabriel  Malata,  learned Solicitor General abandoned the remained 2n d  preliminary point of objection preferred  in  the  1s t   limb,  thus  remaining  with  the  2n d   limb  of  preliminary objection containing a single objection on jurisdiction of the court.

Addressing  the  preliminary  objection  on  jurisdiction, the learned Solicitor General  submitted that, this Court lacks jurisdiction as the  matter is  a  tax  dispute  leading  into  issuance  of  private  ruling  in  accordance  with section  2(3)  of the Tax Administration Act No.  10 of 2015,  [Cap.  438].  To that effect, the learned  Solicitor General  referred the Court to the decision in Commissioner  General  Tanzania Revenue  Authority  v.  JSC Atom red  metzoloto (ARMZ), Consolidated  Civil  Appeals  Nos.  78  and  79 of  2018, (Dodoma  Registry)  (Unreported)  where  the  Court  of  Appeal underscored at page 20 that: -

- "After  the  CGTRA's  determination  of the  objection,  if a  tax payer  is  aggrieved,  he  may appeal  to  the  Board  within  the prescribed  period in terms of  the provisions of  section 16 of  the

TRAA.  Moreover,  while section 7 of the  TRAA  vests the Board with sole original  jurisdiction in all proceedings of  civil nature in respect of disputes arising from revenue laws administered by the Tanzania Revenue Authority..."

Further  reference  was  made  to  the  case  of Vodacom  Tanzania Public  Limited  Company v.  the  Commissioner  General  (TRA),  the Honourable Attorney General  of the  United  Republic of Tanzania, Miscellaneous  Civil  Cause  No.  33  of  2020,  (Main  Registry),  (Unreported) where this Court underscored at page 16 to the effect that: -

"In this matter,  the applicant was aggrieved with the decision of the Commissioner General of TRA. As properly submitted by the  respondent,  under section  7 of the  Tax Revenue Appeals Act,  the remedy available to the applicant was to appeal to the Tax  Revenue  Appeal  Board.  If further  aggrieved,  under  the provisions of  section 53(3) of the  Tax Administration Act,  Cap. 438 (R.E. 2019) and section 16(4) of  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Act,  Cap.  408 (R.E.  2006)  (sic)  the  applicant could appeal to the Tax Appeal Tribunal.  This means that the relief(s) as reliefs and remedies available under the Tax Revenue Appeals Act are

statutory as reliefs and remedies that are available  under the Law  Reform  (Fatal Accidents  and  Misc.  Provisions)  (Judicial Review Procedure and Fees) Rules, 2014".

The  learned  Solicitor  General added  in his submission  regarding mandate of the  Commissioner General  with  reference to the  provisions of section 72 of the Finance Act 2020 that amended section 52 of the Income Tax Act, [Cap. 332 R.E, 2019] by adding subsection  10 and  11 that: -

"(10)  The  Commissioner General shall determine an objection to a tax decision within six months from the date of admission of  the notice of  objection.

(11)  Where  the  Commissioner General fails  to  determine  the objection within the time prescribed under subsection (10),  the tax assessment or tax decision shall be  treated as confirmed and the objector shall have the right to appeal to the Board in accordance with the Tax Revenue Appeals Act".

The  learned  Solicitor  General  argued  that,  failure  to  respond  to  the applicant's  notices  of  objection by  the  1s t respondent  means  that  she

disallowed the objection.  He argued that,  such  provision was a  procedural requirement that can act retrospectively.

He stressed  that,  dealing with this  matter amounts to entertaining  a matter  beyond  jurisdiction  in  matters  which  their jurisdiction  is  vested  in specific  forums.  The  learned  Solicitor  General  cited Tanzania  Revenue Authority  v.  Tango  Transport  Company  Ltd, Civil  Appeal  No.  84  of 2009 (Arusha Registry), (Unreported) where the Court held to that effect.

Mr. Malata  maintained  in  his  submission  that,  tax  issues  are  not subject to judicial  review  and  are  not  subjected  to  ordinary  courts  apart from  appeals  to  the  Court  of  Appeal.  He  argued  that,  for  invocation  of judicial  review,  there  must  be  final  decision  subject  for judicial  review  as held  by the Court of Appeal in the case of Sanai Murumbe and Another v. Muhere Chacha, [1990] T.L.R 54.

In response, Erasmo Nyika, learned counsel for the applicant submitted  that,  it  is  only the  High  Court that  is vested  with jurisdiction  to grant  leave  and  the  aforementioned  prerogative  orders.  The  applicant's counsel  argued  that, what  is  at  stake  is not  a  tax matter, rather, a challenge against misuse of public powers conferred unto the 1s t

respondent.  Revocation  of  private  ruling,  immediate  issuance  of  agency notice  and usurpation  of  Tshs. 146,118,017,395/=  from  the  applicant without  an  assessment  or  a  tax  liability  calculated  confirmed  against  the applicant  was  contrary  to  the  governing  laws  amounting  to  illegalities remediable by way of an application for judicial review.

Furthermore,  it was  argued  that  the  1 s t   respondent's  indecisiveness on  applicant's complaints as well  as the  surfaced  illegalities  prompted  the present application  which,  if granted,  will  ultimately  address the  abuse  of legal mandates  vested  into  the  respondents. Reference  was  made  to Abadiah Selehe v.  Dodoma Wine Co  Ltd [1990] T.L.R  113  where the High Court held that:  -

"... As a general rule the court will refuse to issue the order if there  is  another  convenient  and  feasible  remedy  within  the reach of  the applicant".

Regarding exhaustion of available statutory remedies, the applicant's counsel  referred this Court to a decision of the erstwhile East African Court of  Appeal  in  the  case  of Shah  Vershi  and  Co.  Ltd  v.  The  Transport Licensing Board [1971] E.A 289 where the Court had the following: -

"Ordinarily,  the  High  Court  will  decline  to  interfere  until  the aggrieved party has exhausted his statutory remedy....  But this is a rule of  policy, convenience and discretion rather than a rule of law.  In other words,  the existence of a right of appeal is a factor to be taken into account: it does not bar the remedy (of certiorari) especially where the alternative is not  speedy effective and adequate...

It  is  in   view  of the above the applicant's counsel  implored  this Court to overrule the preliminary point of objection with costs for being  baseless and  misconceived  as  there  is  no  appropriate  alternative  remedy  in  the complained of respondents' unlawful and procedural impropriety.

In  rejoinder,  notably,  the  learned  Solicitor  General  maintained  that the  contested  issue  is  on  tax  falling  beyond  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  as restricted under section 7 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, [Cap. 408].

Now,  having  gone  throuqh  the  Court  record,  the  following  are  the deliberations of this Court as to the issue of jurisdiction of this Court raised by the respondents.

As well  introduced  by this Court at the outset, the  sought for leave for extension of time aims at paving way to an application for leave to file an  application  in  the  High  Court  for  prerogative  remedies  of mandamus and certiorari in remedial for the reluctance manifested by the 1s t respondent in determining the preferred notices of objection and application  for  administrative  review  against  the  1 s t   respondent's  decision to revoke  the  2n d private  ruling and  issuance  of  agency  notice  which adversely affected the applicant's operations, economic interests and welfare.

Notably, from the rival submissions,  parties went into the details and or merits of the very "application for leave" which  is not before this Court. As  such,  such  arguments  will  surface  during  the  very  application  if at  all this Court grants leave for extension of time. As correctly submitted by the learned  Solicitor  General  and  amply  undisputed  by the  learned  applicant's counsel, it is trite rule that jurisdiction is a creature of statutes.

In the same lineage, tax issues as stand other disciplines with special forums,  have  their own  mechanisms  in  handling  disputes  for the  sake  of speedy disposal of any controversies with some clauses addressing various grievances within such mechanisms and beyond through ordinary courts.

In the present matter, the applicant has been clear in her submission that  her  grievances  are  centred  on  three  aspects: one, revocation  of the second private ruling contrary  to section 11(3) and (4) of  the  Tax Administration  Act,  2015; two, issuance  of  agency  notice;  and three, usurpation of Tshs, 146,118,017,395/= from the applicant without assessment  or  calculation  of tax  liability  confirmed  against  the  applicant alleged to be contrary to the laws hence amounting into illegalities.

The  claimed  applicant's  cause  of  delay  has  been  argued  to  be  the inaction  by the  1s t   respondent to  her complaints over the tainted  decision to revoke the 2n d  private ruling  made in  her favour and the further inaction by the 2n d  respondent to her aforesaid complaints.

Whereas the learned Solicitor General submitted that the complained of  inactions  and  acts  amountinq  to  illegalities  by  1s t   respondent,  if  any, squarely fall  under tax  regime,  and ought to  be dealt with  under section  7 of the Tax  Revenue  Appels Act (supra)  and  section  52(10)  &amp;  (11)  of the Income Tax  Act  (supra),  the  applicant's  counsel  strongly  argued  that the complained  of  acts  are  not  tax  matters  but  rather  constitute  misuse  of public  powers  by  the  1s t   respondent  which  are  remediable  by  way  of judicial  review.

Mindful  of the  submissions  and  authorities cited  above to  the  Court for its guidance, this Court tends to agree with the applicant's counsel and holds  a  view  that  where  this  Court  is  seized  with  a  matter  premised  on judicial  review and not original tax dispute or appeal proceedings governed by the provisions pointed out to this Court by the learned Solicitor General, the  provisions of Article  107A  (2)  &amp;  108  of the  Constitution  of the  United Republic  of  Tanzania of 1977  (as  amended), Cap.2 [R.E.2002] read together  with section 17(2) of  the Law  Reform (Fatal Accident  and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, Cap.310 [R.E.2019] adequately confer jurisdiction  to  this  Court  to  make  determination  on  merit  in  relation  to sought judicial review reliefs after hearing the parties where the alternative is  not  accessible  or  speedy  effective  and  or  adequate  and  the  Court  can actually  even  consider  other  compelling  situations  warranting  it  to  issue just and commensurate orders.

In  view  of  the  foregoing, it is certain  that  our  legal  framework through section 52(10) &amp; (11) of the Income Tax Act (supra) and section 7 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act (supra) should not be construed to bar this Court from acting on matters which do not amount to trials and appeals or where  this  Court is justified  to  exercise  its  wide-ranged jurisdiction  under

the Constitution to curb impunity and malpractice committed by administrative  bodies and tribunals,  the  malpractice or illegalities which,  if not  promptly  acted  upon  before  expiration  of six  months  are  capable  of causing gross loss of income, office abuses and, or further illegalities.

Likewise, the failure by the 2n d  respondent to give legal opinion to the 1s t   respondent or any administrative body or tribunal the opinion which,  in terms of Article 59(3) of the Constitution (supra) read together with section 23 of the Office of the Attorney General (Discharge of Duties) Act, Cap.268 R.E.2019,  remain  the  legal  position  of  the  Government  on  the  matter unless  it  is  otherwise  revised  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  the Cabinet Or otherwise recalled by him, cannot bar this Court from exercising its aforesaid jurisdiction.

The position above thus befits the instant matter and not the decision in Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company v, the Commissioner General  (TRA),  the  Honourable  Attorney  General  of  the  United Republic of Tanzania (supra) which was on application for leave to file an  application  for  prerogative  orders  basing  on  a  disputed  taxable  aspect that had already invited the exercise of jurisdiction of tax legal  regime and the  Court  of  Appeal. For  that  matter, it is this  Court's  view  that  the

principle  of General/a specialibus non derogant cannot  equally  apply  in  a wholesale  approach  in  different  situations.  It  was  for  that  ground,  this Court in the immediately cited case above underlined at page  19 that "the Court could entertain this application only if,  the Applicant did admit that disputed amount was valid but the Respondent has taken over and more the right amount."

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  the  Court  subscribes  to  the  decisions  in Abadiah  Selehe v.  Dodoma  Wine Co  Ltd  and  Shah  Vershi  (supra) and Co.  Ltd  v.  The  Transport  Licensing  Board  (supra) cited  to  this Court by the applicant's counsel that,  where the need  arises and  on caseby-case  basis,  this  Court  may  always  exercise  its jurisdiction  and  inquire into complained of acts amounting into illegalities.

Therefore, where allegations of illegalities and abuse of administrative  powers  are  mounted  against  any  specific  administrative body  or  tribunal  vested  with  legal  mandate  to  dispense justice  as  it  has been alleged  in the  instant application,  a  resort by the aggrieved  party to this Court in deserving matters for judicial review is inevitable for it to hear and  determine  the  complained  of  illegalities  or  abuse  of  powers  by  the administrative  body or tribunal  on  merit.  In the circumstances and for the

discussion  held  above,  the  raised  preliminary  objection  on  jurisdiction  of the Court lacks merits in law. Consequently, the same is hereby overruled.

Having  determined  the  issue  of jurisdiction,  resort  is  now  made  to merits  of  the  application. Regarding  extension  of  time,  the  applicant's counsel  submitted  that, the  applicant honestly took steps through  notices of  objection  and  seeking  administrative  review  regarding  her  grievances but  with  the  1s t   respondent  failing  to  play  her  role  as  she  completely ignored  and  never  replied. He  said,  the  attempts  by  the  applicant  to engage the 2n d  respondent have also turned futile.

According to the applicant's counsel, the respondents'  conducts regarding  revocation  of the  2n d   private  ruling  by  the  1 s t   respondent  and issuance of agency notice were tainted with illegalities which are remediable  by way of judicial  review.  He added,  the  blatant failure  by the respondents to act on her grievances led into her delay to file the intended application thus necessitating her to file the instant application for extension of time.

The  counsel  further  argued  that,  the  above  marks  sufficient  reason for  extension  of  time  as  required  as  held by  the  Court  of  Appeal  of Tanzania  decision  in  the  case  of Insignia  Limited  v.  Commissioner

General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil  Application  No.  2 of 2007, (Dar es Salaam), (Unreported) that cited with approval the case of Shanti v.  Hindocha  and  Others, [1973]  E,A  207  where  the  Courts  held  that, though "sufficient  reason" is  not defined,  the same  should  revolve around reasons capable of warranting grant of the sought extension of time.

Besides,  extension of time can  be granted when there are illegalities on  the  decision  made  as  held  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  the  case  of Principal  Secretary,  Ministry of Defence and National Service v.  D. P.  Valambhia [1992]  T.LR  185.  Basing  on  the  two  sets  (cause  of the delay  and  the  alleged  illegalities),  the  applicants'  counsel  urged  for  the application to be granted as the same will not prejudice the respondents.

In reply,  the  learned  Solicitor  General  for  the  respondents  when submitting  against  merits of the application  raised  a  preliminary objection styled "the application for extension of time is unattainable in  law as  the  applicant  is  driving  two  horses  at  a  time  contrary  to  the law"

The objection  by the  Solicitor General  was that,  on  29/01/2021  and 12/02/2021,  the applicant initiated  an appeal  process to the Tax  Revenue

Appeal Board by  filing a notice of  appeal and statement  of  appeal regarding  appeals  number 48  and  50  of 2021  challenging  the  decision  of the  1s t   respondent in  issuing  an  agency  notice  and  1 s t   respondent's  notice of revocation  of the  private  ruling.  In  the  circumstances,  he  argued  such move  amounts  to  an  abuse  of the  court  process  as  held  by the  Court of Appeal in Serengeti  Breweries  Limited  v.  Hector  Sequiraa, Civil Application No. 395/18 of 2019, (Dar es Salaam Registry), (Unreported).

The  Solicitor  General  argued  that,  the  complained  of  revocation  of the  second  private  ruling  by  the  1s t  respondent  was  in  the  hands  of  the applicant by the time of filing the objection.  He argued that, the matter is a tax  dispute  of  which  the  applicant  has  to  channel  it  through  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board.  Mr.  Malata  argued  that,  the  given  reasons  are insufficient arguing that, the applicant is the own cause of the delay.

Mr.  Malata further argued that, the applicant has failed to account for each  day of the  delay  as  set forth  by  the  Court  of Appeal  in  the  case  of Lyamuya  Construction Company  Ltd. v. Board of Registered Trustees of Young Women's Christian Association of Tanzania, Civil Application  No.  2  of 2010,  (Unreported).  He argued that,  the  respondents

did  not author the alleged cause of delay at any rate, rather, the said delay was solely orchestrated by the applicant.

Regarding illegality,  Mr.  Malata argued that, everything in the present matter was done in compliance with the law and that nothing went astray the  laws. From  the  above,  the  learned  Solicitor  General  urged  for  the application for extension of time to be refused, consequently, with costs.

In  rejoinder,  the  applicant's  counsel  submitted  that,  the  referred  to preferred  appeals  are  on  substantive  issues  and  not  on  legality  of  the processes.  In  other  words,  the  grievances  in  the  preferred  avenues  are distinctly  different  from  each  other.  Besides,  the  allegations  set  forth  by way of an objection are on points of fact requiring proof through evidence.

Regarding merits of the application, the applicant's counsel reiterated his  submission  in  chief  stressing  that,  the  applicant  did  not  at  any  point author the  delay  adding  that,  the  prayer  for  extension  of time  has  basis from the delay caused by the respondents and that on top of the deiay, the decisions made by the 1s t  respondent had been tainted with illegalities.

This  Court  will  start  with  the  issue  raised  by  the  learned  Solicitor General that, the applicant has initiated appeal  processes amid the present

application  for  extension  of time.  On  that  issue,  this  Court  is  of the  firm view that such  an argument is misconceived, for if that has been the case considering  the  fact  that  the  present  application  was  the  first  to  be  fiied and  the  fact  that  a  notice  of appeal  is  not  an  appeal,  thus,  it  is  the  said latter move  that  has  to be  challenged, if any, and not  the present application which as such, was preferred first.

In  other  words,  if  at  all  the  argument  is  that  the  applicant  has invoked  two  sets of remedies simultaneously over the same grievances,  if any,  then,  it  is  the  later  preferred  option  that  has  to  be  challenged  or argued to be stayed  regard also  be paid on the court levels. After all, that argument has been resisted by the applicant's counsel arguing that the two sets of judicial  proceedings vary in terms of the sought for remedies.

Regarding  the very application  for extension  of time,  it  has  been  to the satisfaction of this Court that, the applicant has demonstrated sufficient cause  for  the  delay  in  filing  the present  application.  To  this  Court,  a meaningful  account  on  time  spent  in  waiting  for  a  response  from  the respondents  on  letters  dated  23r d   September,2919  and  on  18t h   October, 2019  which  were  duly  served  to  the  1 s t   respondent  and  from  her  letters dated  12t h  June,  2020 and  20t h  October,  2020 which were also duly served

to  the  2 ^ d respondents,  and  all letters  being not  acted upon  by  both respondents,  is  a  cumulative  account  of days  of delay  and  takes  care  of day-to-day  account  of  the  delay  referred  to by  the learned Solicitor General.

It would thus be absurd to require the applicant to state the reasons as to why the  respondents delayed to  respond  or  rather act to what s/he ought to do especially where there  is evidence that they never  responded to the applicant's formally lodged grievances.

&gt;

!

To this  Court,  the  delay  was  out  of control  of the  applicant  having demonstrated the steps taken as made clear through the affidavit affirmed by Bikash  Subba.  In Yusufu Same and  Hawa  Dada v. Hadija Yusufu, Civil  Appeal  No.  1/2002,  (Dar es  Salaam  Registry)  (Unreported),  the  High Court observed at page 9 which this. Court subscribes to that: -

"It should be observed that the term  'sufficient cause' should not  be  interpreted  narrowly  but  should  be  given  a wide interpretation  to  encompass  all  reasons  or  causes  which  are outside the applicant's power to control or influence resulting in delay in taking any necessary step".

In  view  of  the  above,  considering  the  alleged  illegalities;  the  steps taken  by  the  applicant;  and,  the  fact  that  the  response  on  part  of  the respondents  was  solely  within  their  powers  without  any  room  for  the applicant to influence or curb their highest order of irresponsibility demonstrated above, this Court finds the present application is meritorious.

It is from  the  above  discussion  in  unison,  the  leave  sought  for extension of time to lodge an application for leave to file an application for prerogative  orders  of certiorari and mandamus is hereby  granted  with statutory  extension  starting  to  run  from  the  date  of  this  Ruling.  In  the circumstances of the matter, parties are ordered to shoulder for their costs.

It is so ordered.
