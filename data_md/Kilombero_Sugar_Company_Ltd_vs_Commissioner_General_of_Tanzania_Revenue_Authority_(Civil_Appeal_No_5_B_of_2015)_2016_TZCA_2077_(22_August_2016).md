## RULING OF THE COURT

16th   Fabrusry,  a   2 2 n d   August,  2016 r . T L ' i r f . p 7 I- t l i i   t ~ &gt; .   i f t r

The  respondent,  relying  on  Rule  21  of  me  la x   Kevenue  Appeals Tribunal  Rules,  2001  (the  Rules)  raises a  preliminary objection to the effect that  the  appellant's  appeal  is  bad  in  law  as  neither  the  decision  nor  the decree incorporated in the record of appeal were signed by all the members of the Tribunal who heard the appeal.

Mr.  Juma  Beleko,  learned Advocate for the respondent submitted that the  words "SgrF appearing  after the  name  of each  of the  members  of the Tribunal in the copy of the decision contained in the record of appeal did not amount to the decision  having  been  signed  by them.  For a  decision to  be a proper decision in law, it must bear the signature of the members. The words "Son",  he  urged, were insufficient to constitute a signature under Rule 21.

Furthermore,  Mr.  Beleko submitted that a valid decree of the Tribunal is also one that must bear the signatures of all the members who heard the appeal. The decree  in the  record  of appeal  only contained the signature of the Vice-Chairman. As the  record of appeal  must contain  a  decree, the one included was invalid for lack of the members' signatures. This  rendered the purported  appeal  incompetent and  it ought to  be struck out with  costs.  He relied  on  f^beys  Intertrads  Com pany  Limited v.  The  Com m issioner Genera!, Tanzania  Revenue Authority,  Civil Appeal  No.  68 "A" of 2010 and SCB Tanzania Limited v. The Commissioner Genera! of Tanzania Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal No. 32 of 2007; and Ami Port Operations  (T)  Limited  v.  The  Com m issioner for  Incom e Tax,  Civil Appeal  No.  28 of 2005 (All CAT,  unreported).

Resisting, Mr. Ayoub  Mtafys, learned Advocate  for  the appellant submitted that the words "Sgn" on the certified  copy of the decision  meant that it was properly signed by the members.  He pointed out that the decision was also signed by all the members as indicated in the stamp that was affixed on  it,  titled  "Certified  Copy  of the  Original  proceedings,  Judgment,  Ruling, Order"  which  beared  the  signatures  of  the  Vice-Chairman  and  the  two members who heard the appeal. That Rule 21 was complied with.

On the impugned decree,  Mr.  Mtafya  referring to section  25(1) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal Act,  Cap.  408,  R.E.  2010  (the Act) and  Rule 24(1),  strenuously  submitted  that as  an  appeal  lies  to  the  Court of Appeal against a  decision  or judgment of the Tribunal,  it was  sufficient to  appeal only against a decision. There was,  he contended,  no requirement to appeal to the Court against a decree.  He submitted that Rule 21, strictly read, only covers a decision,  not a  decree.  If the Rule  had  intended to cover a  decree, it should  have  clearly  said  so.  That  in Mbeya  Intertrade  Company Limited  case,  the learned  Advocate  for  the  respondent  had  misled  the Court in  relying  on  Rule  21  and  importing  under  Rule  24(3),  the Appellate

Jurisdiction Act,  Cap  141  R.E,  2002 end the Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009 the requirement that  a decree must be signed  by the members.

In addition,  Mr.  Mtafya submitted that the decree was also valid under section  32(2)  and  (3)  of the Act,  because  it had  the Tribunal's  seal  affixed on  it,  which authenticated and  rendered  it a valid  instrument.  He invited  us to dismiss the preliminary objection with costs.

The first issue to be resolved is whether the typed words "Sgrfr on the certified  copy  of the  decision  are  sufficient to  constitute  a  signature  under Rule 21. The Black's Law Dictionary defines the word sign as:

"To identify (a record) by means o f  a signature,  mark or other symbol with intent to authenticate it as an act or a judgment o f  a person identifying it"; and

## a sig n a tu re  as:

"Any name,  mark; or writing used with  the intention o f authenticating a document"

We  would  agree  with  Mr.  Beleko  that  the  typed  words "Sgrf'  in  the record  of  appeal  in  themselves  could  not  constitute  a  signature  and  one which was capable of identifying their author or authenticating the decision concerned.  In our respectful view,  Rule 21 was not complied with.

Second,  in  an  attempt to  scheme around the  mandatory requirement of incorporating a decree in the  record of appeal as an essential document, Mr.  Mtafya  submitted  that  because section  25(1)  of the Act and  Rule  24(1) grants  a  party  a  right  of  appeal  to  the  Court  against  a  decision  of  the Tribunal,  a  decree was  not an  essential  document  in  the  record  of appeal. With respect, this proposition is untenable. The Civil Procedure Code, Cap.33 R.E.  2002,  which  under  Rule  23(2)  mandatory applies to the  execution  of the decree or order of the Tribunal defines a decree in  section  3  as:

"3.  the form al expression o f  an adjudication which, so far as regards the court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights o f the parties with regard to all or any o f  the matters in controversy in the su it"

and a judgment as:

"the statement given by a Judge or a Magistrate o f the grounds for a decree or order".

The Black's Law Dictionary, 9t h Ed;  defines a decision as:

"A ju d icia i or agency determination after consideration o f the facts and the law;  esp) a ruling,  order or  judgm ent pronounced by a court when considering or disposing o f a case",

## and an appellafele decision as:

"A  decree  or  order  that  is  sufficiently  final  to  receive appellate review,...."

Succinctly  put  by  B.M.  Prasad  and  M.  Mohan  in The  MLJ,  MANUAL OF THE CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE, Vol. I,  15th  Ed,  pp.  1630:

"a decision does not operate as a decree".....................

"unless and until decree is form ally drawn up in terms o f the  Judgment, there  can  neither  be  an  appeal  nor execution"

In The Registered Trustees cf the Kariam  Faith Healing Centre @ W ANAKAQKSI V. The Registered Trustees cf the Catholic Church Sumbsivsngs Diocese, Civi! Appeal No. 64 of 2007, (CAT, unreported) Court had occassion to state: r t*

"a decree constitutes the final adjudication o f  the matters in dispute  whereas a judgm ent is merely a statement o f the reasons in support of the decree.

the  decree  and judgment  are  composite documents which together constitute the adjudication o f  the court. It is no wonder that nomally an appeal lies against a decree which is the formal adjudication o f the court expressing it   In  this sence,  it is evident that the decree follows the judgment'\

More  precisely, in Zepharia  Letashu  v Moruo  Ndeiamia,  Civil Appeal  No.  31 of 1998,  (CAT,  unreported) the Court stated:

"A decree is a vital  and central  part o f  the record  o f  appeal since the appeal is  granted on it, hence its absence is fatal to the whole exercise

All  considered,  in  our  respectful  view,  a  decree  remains  an  essential document in  an  appeal  emanating  from  the Tribunal  and  must  be  brought on the record of the Court in a record of appeal as required by Rule 96(l)(h) and 96(2)(e) of the Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009.

Third,  Mr.  Mtafya  submitted that a  decree  issued  under Rule  23(2)  is only for the  purpose of execution  and  not for an  appeal.  With  respect,  this cannot  find  favour  with  us.  Rule  23(2)  does  not  limit  the  end  use  of the decree  by  a  party.  No  doubt,  a  party  can  only  enforce  a  valid  decree. However,  a  plain  reading  of Rule  23(2)  shows that  it does  not  bar a  party from applying to the Tribunal for the issuance of a valid decree for an appeal or any other  purpose.  To  say that  it does,  is to  stretch  the  construction  of Rule 23(2)  beyond  its breaking  point.

Fourth,  in our considered view, section 32(2) and (3) of the Act cannot save the defective decree, signed only by the Vice-Chairman and  not all the members. The  purported  authentication  of the  decree  by affixing  on  it the seal  of  the  Tribunal  cannot  validate  an  already  defective  decree.  Validity cannot be granted to what was already patently invalid in law.

For all  the  above  reasons  and  going  by Midcom Tanzania  Limited v.  Commissioner General  (TRA),  Civil Appeal No . 13  of  2011  (CAT, unreported)  and  Mbeya  Intertrade  Company  Ltd.  case, vve are constrained  to  find  the  decree  not  having  been  signed  by  all  members  of the  Tribunal,  defective.  This  renders  the  purported  appeal  incompetent. Accordingly, we proceed to strike it out with costs.

Ordered accordingly.

DATcD at DAR ES SALAAM this 23rd  day of February,  2016.
