## RULING OF THE COURT

8th   &amp;  14th  July,  2020

## MUGASHA. J.A.:

The  appellant  is  a  Telecommunication Network  and  Wireless Services provider registered in Tanzania. The appellant entered  into an agreement  with  the  software  supplier,  Siemens  Telecommunications (PTY)  Ltd  for  purchase  of  software  in  order  to  enable  the  appellant operate the software in accordance with his requirements. The respondent conducted  tax  audit  in  respect  of the  appellant's  business affairs for the period covering the year 2001 to 2004.

On  10th   November  2006  the  respondent  served  the  appellant with  preliminary  audit  findings.  In  the  wake  of  the  appellant  being discontented with the tax audit,  a  meeting  was convened  between the parties following which, on 24th  April 2007 the respondent prepared and issued  the  revised  preliminary audit findings.  As the  appellant was  still not happy  with the tax audit results, two more meetings were convened  between  the  parties  but  yielded  no  positive  results  as  the appellant  was  not  yet  satisfied with  the revised preliminary  audit findings. Ultimately, on 21/8/2008 the respondent issued to the appellant demand notices for withholding tax and penalties with respect to  the  services  and  royalty  amounting  to  TZS.  1,028,644,778.87  and TZS.  1,917,171,792.00 respectively.

The  appellant  being  dissatisfied  with  the  assessment  filed  an appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board  (the Board) vide Tax Appeal No.  20 of 2014. The  Board dismissed the appeal  in its decision,  handed down  on 21/8/2015. Aggrieved with that decision, the appellant unsuccessfully  appealed  to  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  (the Tribunal)  vide Tax Appeal  No.  22  of 2015  hence the present appeal to the  Court.  In  the  Memorandum  of  Appeal,  the  appellant  has  fronted five grounds of complaint as follows:

- 1. The Honourable Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal grossly misdirected itse lf and erred in  law in  holding that payments for the right to use software should attract royalty;
- 2.  The  Honourable  Tax  Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in  law in arriving at its decision by holding that the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board  had  determined and  well settled  that payments  for  the right to use the software constituted a royalty;
- 3. The  Honourable  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in  law in holding  that  payments  for  the  right  to  use  the  software  are chargeable  to  tax in  the  form  o f withholding  tax under section 34(1) (c) o f  the Income Tax Act, 1973;
- 4. The Honourable Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by its failure  to  give  effect  to  the  correct  interpretation  o f the  word ' ro yalty' as  used under section  3 o f the Income  Tax Act,  1973; and
- 5. The Honourable Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by its failure  to  strictly  interpret  a  taxing  provision  contrary  to  the cardinal  principle governing interpretation o f  taxing statutes."

When  the  appeal  was  called  on  for  hearing,  the  appellant  was represented  by  Ms.  Hadija  Kinyaka  and  Dr. Erasmo  Nyika,  learned counsel  whereas  the  respondent  had  the  services  of  Messrs.  Harold Gugami,  Marcel  Busegano,  Juma  Kisongo  and  Hospis  Maswanyia,  all learned State Attorneys from the respondent's office.

In  order to satisfy ourselves on the propriety of the appeal which is accompanied by two different certificates of delay, we invited learned counsel for the parties to address us on the matter.

Apart from conceding that on  record there are two certificates of delay,  Ms.  Kinyaka  was quick to shift the blame to the  Registrar of the Tribunal  claiming  that she  issued  a  second  certificate  of delay without withdrawing the initial certificate of delay. She added that, although the appellant  made  written  correspondences  on  the  matter,  that  was  not acknowledged  by  the  Registrar.  On  the  way  forward,  the  learned counsel  urged  the  Court  to  ignore  the  initial  certificate  of  delay  and consider  the  appeal  to  be  competent on  the  basis  of the  subsequent certificate of delay and proceed to hear the appeal or in the alternative, strike  out  the  appeal  with  no  order  as  to  costs  so  as  to  enable  the appellant to bring a proper appeal.

On the other hand, Mr. Gigami the respondent's counsel submitted  that,  the  subsequent  certificate  of  delay  is  inconsequential and it cannot be acted upon by the Court because the first certificate of delay was not withdrawn by the Registrar of the Tribunal (the Registrar).  As such,  he argued that,  on the basis of the first certificate of  delay  the  appeal  is  not  competent  as  it  was  filed  beyond  60  days

from  the  date  of  period  excluded  for  the  preparation  of the  certified copies  of  the  proceedings,  judgment  and  decree  of  the  impugned Tribunal's decision. He thus urged the Court to strike out the incompetent appeal with costs for being time barred.

Having considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties,  the  issue for our consideration  is the  propriety or otherwise of the appeal before us.

On 6/12/2018 the Registrar issued a certificate of delay excluding the period from  15/11/2017 to 28/11/2018 to have been utilised for the preparation and delivery of the certified copies of the judgment, decree and  proceedings of the  impugned decision of the Tribunal.  After expiry of 55 days that is on  22/1/2019 the appellant's counsel vide letter  Ref. FK/CF/VTL/Tax  Appeal  No.  22  of  2015  as  seen  at  page  574  of  the record  of  appeal,  requested  to  be  supplied  with  certified  copies  of judgment decree and  proceedings on  ground that the initially supplied copies  were  not  signed  by  the  Vice  Chairman  and  Members  of  the Board. However, on the record there is no evidence that the Registrar did acknowledge  or  make  any  response  to  the  appellant's letter. Instead, on record at page 580 there is a letter Ref. FK/CF/VTL/App.NO.22 OF 2015 dated 12/3/2019 whereby the

appellant's counsel sought  a second  certificate of  delay which is reflected  at page  583 of the  record  now excluding  the  period  between 15/11/2007 to 11/3/2019 to have been  utilised for the preparation and delivery  of  the  proceedings,  judgment  and  decree  of  the  impugned decision of the Tribunal.

The  Court  in  the  past  has  dealt  with  the  issue  surrounding  the status of an appeal which is accompanied by two certificates of delay in the  cases  of maneno  mengi  lim ite d  and th re e   o th e rs  vs  fa r id a SAID  NYAMACHUMBE AND THE  REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES [2004] TLR 391  and omary shaban s.  nyambu, as Administrator of Estate of the late IDDI  MOHA  vs  CAPITAL  DEVELOPMENT  a u th o rity   AND  TWO o th e rs , Civil Appeal  No, 256 of 2017. In the latter case the Court held:

"There  cannot be  two  certificates  o f delay  concurrently applicable in respect o f the same matter; in this case the certificate  o f June,  2003  was  the  valid one  and the second  certificate  o f  $ h   July, 2003  was  o f  no  legal consequence as it amounted to extending the time within which  to  file  appeal,  something  the  Registrar  had  no power to do.  It was also  wrong for the Registrar to issue a  second  certificate  while  the  first  one  had  not  been withdrawn;  if   the  intention was  to  withdraw  the  first certificate, then  the  Registrar  would  have  indicated  so when issuing the second certificate."

What  transpired  above  is  similar  to  the  matter  under  scrutiny. Thus,  being  guided  by  the  stated  position  of the  law,  since  the  first certificate was not withdrawn, and considering that the two certificates of delay cannot co-exist in one appeal, the appellant cannot rely on the second  certificate which  is  in  our view  inconsequential.  In this  regard, the first certificate  of delay which  was a valid  one and  in  terms of the proviso to Rule 90 (1) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, the appeal  ought to  have  been  filed  not later than  27/1/2019.  However,  it was filed  162 days after the expiry of the excluded  period and  beyond the prescribed  period.  As earlier stated, the second  certificate of delay was of no  legal  consequence as  it constructively  extended  time within which  to  file  an  appeal  which  is  not  the  mandate  of  the  Registrar. Moreover, it was improper for the Registrar to issue a second certificate of delay without having withdrawn the first one.  If the intention was to withdraw  the  first  certificate  of delay,  then  the  Registrar  should  have indicated so when issuing the second certificate of delay.

We  also  find  that,  the  appellant's  counsel  shares  the  blame  in what has befallen this  appeal. We say so  because after being  supplied with the  requisite documents  by the  Registrar,  she took no action  and remained with the irregular documents for 55 days which was close to expiry of the  period  within  which  to  lodge  an  appeal,  without  seeking the  indulgence  of the  Registrar  to  have  the  documents  rectified.  This was  not  a  demonstration  of  diligence  on  the  part  of  the  appellant's counsel.

In  view  of what we  have endeavored to demonstrate there is no gainsaying  that the appeal  is  time  barred  and  we  accordingly  strike  it out.  We make  no order as to costs since the anomaly has  been  raised by the Court suo motu.

DATED at DAR-ES-SALAAM this 13th  day of July, 2020.
