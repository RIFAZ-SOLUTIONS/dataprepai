## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

8th  &amp; 19th  June, 2020

## NDIKA. J.A.:

On  appeal  is  the judgment and  decree  of the Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  ("the Tribunal") dated  25t h  October,  2018  in Tax Appeal  No.  19 of 2016.  The  said  judgment  substantially  affirmed  the  decision  of  the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Board  ("the  Board")  dated  1s t  July,  2016  in  Consolidated Income Tax Appeals No. 74 and 75 of 2015.

The  brief background to this appeal  is as follows:  The  Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority ("the respondent") conducted an audit on the tax affairs of Kilombero Sugar Company Limited ("the appellant") for

the years of income of 2011  and  2012.  The  respondent came  up with  an audit  report  dated  13t h   February,  2013  accompanied  by  assessments  for both years of income (Exhibits A-5 and A-6).  Having received the report and the  assessments,  the  appellant  objected  to  the  assessments  by  lodging notices  of  objection  dated  28t h   March,  2012  for  the  two  years  of  income (Exhibits A-7 and A-8). The respondent, having reviewed the notices, issued a proposal as per two letters both dated 20t h  May, 2014 for the two years of income (Exhibits A-9 and A-10). The appellant responded to the proposal by letters dated 25t h  June,  2014 and  22n d  August,  2014,  which  were admitted, respectively, as Exhibits A -ll and A-12. The respondent, in response, made final decisions by way of two letters dated 8t h  January, 2015 followed up by assessments. The decisions and assessments were admitted as Exhibits A-l and A-2 respectively.

The appellant was aggrieved by the assessments. Thus,  it lodged two appeals in the Board - Appeal  No. 74 of 2015 for the year 2011 and Appeal No.  75 of 2015 for the year 2012. The Board consolidated the appeals and and  determined  them  as  one  appeal  vide  its  judgment  of  1s t   July,  2016. Although the consolidated appeal was partly allowed, the appellant was still aggrieved, hence its appeal to the Tribunal.

It  is  instructive  to  note  that  in  the  aforesaid  appeal  to  the Tribunal, the appellant raised eight grounds of complaint which,  in effect, contended that:  first,  that the  Board  sustained the disallowance of 15% of the cost of invoices  from  Illovo  Sugar  Limited  ("ISL")  without  considering  the  entire evidence  on record. Secondly,  that  findings  on  whether  the  appellant submitted six out of ten invoices were not backed by any evidence. Thirdly, that the disallowance alluded to earlier was based on wrong construction of sections  33  and  34 of the  Income Tax Act,  2004.  Fourthly,  that the  Board erroneously ordered  the  appellant to  pay withholding  tax  on  management fees  paid  to Zambia  Sugar  Limited  ("ZSL").  Fifthly,  that the  Board  misread the evidence on record and misconstrued the objection proceedings procedure  under section  13  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  Cap.  408  RE 2010 ("the TRAA") when determining an issue on unreconciled Value Added Tax  ("VAT")  amount  of TZS.  709,874,107.00.  And  finally,  that documents availed  by  the  appellant  to  the  respondent  during  objection  proceedings should  have  formed  the  basis  for  reducing  the  above  unreconciled  VAT amount to TZS. 52,149,791.00.

The Tribunal  partly allowed  the appeal.  Being  aggrieved  by a  part the  Tribunal's  decision,  the  appellant  now  appeals  to  this  Court  on grounds as follows:

- 1.  By holding that it was correct for the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board (Board) to rely on Exhibit R-l based on the quotation that " once  admitted in  evidence  without objection  from  the  other side,  the contests (sic) of a document are also held proved..." the  Honourable  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal (Tax  Tribunal) erred  in  law  by  misinterpreting  or  misapprehension  of  the position of  the law in the admissibility of  evidence;
- 2.  The holding of the Honourable  Tax Tribunal which suggests that failure to object the admission into evidence of Exhibit R-l by the counsel for the appellant rendered the contents of  Exhibit R-l as proved, the Honourable Tax Tribunal erred in law by not making a  specific finding  on  whether or not Exhibit R-l  was actually a proof  of  a request of  10 invoices from the respondent to the appellant, an issue which was fundamental in the appeal;
- 3.  The conclusion that "from the foregoing if the appellant was not comfortable with Exhibit R-l he should have produced what he considered to be the correct sample items/invoices requested by the respondent... instead of  complaining that Exhibit R-l is a mere internal document of  the respondent which came up in the WSD as Annexure TRA-2, "the Honourable Tax Tribunal erred in

law by misinterpreting and or ignoring the provisions of  section 13 of  the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, 2000 on the procedures for handling objection proceedings;

- 4.  In  determining  whether or not the  Honourable  Board  was correct in citing and applying the provisions of  sections 33 and 35 of the Income  Tax Act,  2004 while disallowing 15%  of the costs of invoices,  the Honourable  Tax Tribunal erred in law by relying  only  on  documents  of the  respondent  issued  at  the earlier stages of the objection proceedings and not considering documents supplied by  the  appellant at a  later stage  of the proceedings as per section 13 of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, 2000;
- 5.  Having  held  that  "we  are  in  agreement  with  the  learned counsel for the parties that it is a settled  principle that decisions of public authorities must be accompanied with reasons," the Honourable Tribunal erred in law for not assessing evidence and coming up with its decision or  position on whether  or not it was proper for the Board to hold that reasons were given  through the  request  of documents  as  opposed  to  the  decision  and whether the decision of the respondent had sufficient reasons; and
- 6.  By holding that the Board was correct to hold that"it was a collective  view of this Honourable Board that three years given by the appellant (sic)  to reconcile  the figures in its records is

more  than  enough/ '  to  justify  the  disallowance  of  T.Shs. 709,874,107.00,  the Honourable  Tax  Tribunal erred in  law by not  considering  the  procedures  of objection  proceedings  as provided  under section  13  of the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Act, 2000 and failed to make determination on a number of issues raised  in the appeal against a decision of  the Board.

At  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  Mr.  Ayoub  Mtafya,  learned  advocate, appeared  for the  appellant whereas  Mr.  Evarist  Mashiba,  learned  Principal State Attorney, appeared for the respondent with the assistance of Messrs. Harold Gugami, Hospis Maswanyia and Yohana Ndila, learned State Attorneys.

Mr.  Mtafya  began  his  quest  by  adopting  the  written  submissions  he had  lodged  in  support of the  appeal,  which  he then  highlighted  generally. His  primary  submission  was  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  misinterpreting  or misapprehending  the  position  of  the  law  on  admissibility  and  veracity  of documentary evidence. Elaborating, he contended that the Tribunal wrongly held  that  the  contents  of  Exhibit  R-l,  which  was  admitted  without  any objection from the appellant, were effectually proved on account of absence of  any  objection.  This  exhibit  contained  a  list  of  ten  invoices  which  the respondent alleged  to  have  requested  from  the  appellant.  The  appellant's

position was that it was only requested to submit sampled invoice and that it met the request by submitting six invoices and therefore,  Exhibit R-l was not proof that all ten invoices therein were requested.

Learned counsel argued further that during objection proceedings, the appellant submitted  all  necessary documents  in  terms of section  13  of the TRAA.  However, neither the Board nor the Tribunal bothered to refer to the aforesaid  sequenced  documents.  The  appellant,  he  added,  was  denied  by the  respondent  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  on  the  documents  by  giving required clarification.  He then complained that the assessments were issued without any reasons being assigned, which was a breach of the duty for any public body to give  reasons for its decisions.  Learned  counsel  insisted that the respondent ought to have given reasons to justify its assessments.

Replying,  Mr.  Mashiba contended that the appeal was misconceived in that it was wholly based on matters of fact contrary to section 25 (2) of the TRAA.  He further argued  that the  appellant failed  to  produce  evidence  on the  arm's  length  transactions  between  it  and  its  associates.  As  regards Exhibit R-l,  he argued that the Tribunal  rightly concluded that its contents were proved because the appellant did not controvert its veracity before the

Board. Mr. Gugami  took  over  from  Mr. Mashiba,  maintaining  that  the second to the sixth grounds of appeal  raise  no point of law  but matters of fact.  He urged us to disregard them all.

Mr.  Gugami went on submitting that the respondent assigned reasons in  its  assessments  (Exhibits A-l  and  A-2)  and  that the  appellant was fully accorded  an  opportunity to  be  heard  before the assessments were  issued. He elaborated  that the appellant was given  an  opportunity for settling  the objection  when  it was sent a  proposal  to which  it  responded  by  making  a counter  proposal.  Finally,  learned  counsel  denied  that  the  Tribunal  shied away from its duty to re-evaluate the evidence as the first appellate forum. To  illustrate  this  fact,  he  referred  us  to  page  1300  of  record  where  the Tribunal stated, in its determination, that it had carefully read and examined the record before it.

In a brief rejoinder, Mr. Mtafya maintained that the appeal raises clear points of law  notably the Tribunal's failure to re-appraise the evidence, the Tribunal's misapprehension of the evidence on admissibility and veracity of Exhibit R-l as well as the contention that no reasons were assigned for the respondent's assessments.

Having  carefully  examined  the  record  and  bearing  in  mind  the  lucid submissions of learned counsel for the parties, we now proceed to deal with the merits or otherwise of the appeal by considering the grounds seriatim.

At the outset, we wish to underline, first, that in our determination we are cognizant that in terms of section  18  (2)  (b) of the TRAA, the onus of proving  that  the  assessment  or  decision  in  respect  of which  an  appeal  is preferred is excessive or erroneous lies on the appellant. Secondly, we think that the Indian decision in Meenakshi Mills, Madurai v. The Commissioner of Income Tax,  Madras (1957)  AIR 49,  1956  SCR 691, can provide us with a useful guide as to what a question of law would entail in  consonance with the terms of section  25  (2) of the TRAA.  In that case, the  Supreme Court of India  defined  what a  question  of law  is  in  terms of section 66 (1) of the Indian Income Tax Act that restricted references to the High Court on questions of law only. The Court summed up the position  by stating the following as questions of law:

"(1) When  the  point  for  determination  is  a  pure question of law such as construction of a statute or document of  title....

(2)  When  the  point  for  determination  is  a  mixed question  of law and fact;  while  the  finding  of the Tribunal on the facts found is final its decision as to the legal effect of those finding is a question of  law which can be reviewed by the court.

(3) A finding on a question of  fact is open to attack , under section 66(1) as erroneous in law when there is no evidence to support it or if  it  is  perverse."

The  apex  Court  also  took  the  view  that  an  inference  of  fact  would remain as such and that its character will not change:

"(4) When the finding is one of  fact, the fact that it is itself  in inference from other  basic facts will  not alter its character as one of  fact."

Adverting to the merits or otherwise of the appeal, we begin with the first ground of appeal, which contends that the Tribunal erred in misinterpreting or misapprehending the position of the law on the admissibility  and  veracity  of  documentary  evidence,  which  in  this  case  is Exhibit R-l.

We note from the  record that it was the appellant's  main  contention all  along that there was no proof that the respondent specifically asked for

ten  invoices  to  establish  its  arm's  length  transactions  between  it  and  its associates.  Exhibit  R-l  was  claimed  to  be  an  internal  document  but  not a request addressed to the appellant requesting for the ten  invoices. On that basis, the  Tribunal's finding that "once  admitted  in  evidence  without objection from  the other side,  the contents of a  document are also held proved"\s attacked as being a  misapprehension of the  law on admissibility and veracity of documentary evidence.

It is indeed true that the Tribunal based the aforesaid holding upon its citation with approval of an Indian decision in Bhagyarathi v. Agadhuchan Das (1986) 62 Cut LT 298 which it had referred to in its past decision in Samson Ng'walida v. Commissioner  General, TRA, published at page 430  in  Dr.  Fauz Twaib's "A  Casebook on the Tax Law of Tanzania/' Volume  2,  LawAfrica,  Nairobi,  2018.  We  have  read  the  above cited  Indian case. What it says is that whenever a document is admitted in course  of  trial  'without  objection'  it  unquestionably  goes  to  say  that  the contents  of the  document  are  also  admitted.  More  significantly,  however, the  Court  in  that  decision  acknowledged  the  principle  enunciated  by  the Supreme Court of India in the case of P.C.  Purushottama Raddiar v. S. Perumal, AIR 1972 S. C. 608 thus:

". . . where certain reports were marked without any objection  it  was  not  open  to  the  respondent  to object  to  their  admissibility  and  that  once  such document was properly admitted\ the contents of the document were also admitted into evidence  though  these  contents may not be conclusive evidence. "[Emphasis added]

We are cognizant that sections 63 to 67 of the  Evidence Act,  Cap.  6 RE 2002 govern proof of contents of a document,  by primary or secondary evidence. Admittedly, admission of a document is not conclusive proof of its contents; it does not entail any adjudication as to its proof.

In the instant case,  however, we do not think that the Tribunal  in  its impugned  holding  above  acted  on  the  assumption  that  the  contents  of Exhibit R-l  were conclusive evidence of the  matter in  dispute just because its admissibility was not objected. It is noteworthy that at page 1,300 of the record,  the  Tribunal  observed,  rightly  so  in  our  view,  that  the  Board  was justified to rely on  Exhibit R-l  along with all other exhibits A-l to A12 in its decision.  Its  probative  value  had  to  be  weighed  against  the  rest  of  the evidence  on  the  record.  Furthermore,  we  note  that  at  page  1,301  of the record, the  Tribunal was  alive that  the veracity of Exhibit R-l was

unchallenged as there was no evidence to the contrary from the appellant. We are, therefore, satisfied that there was no misapprehension on the part of the Tribunal. At any rate, it is not our task at this stage to re-examine the probative value of Exhibit R-l.

The above apart, it is evident from pages 1,301 to 1,302 of the record of  appeal, the  Tribunal marshalled capable arguments  based  on  the evidence on  record that culminated  in  its conclusion that the appellant was requested to  produce ten  sample invoices but that it produced  six invoices only. It  concluded  that  the  respondent's  auditors  could  not,  therefore, establish  that the transaction  between the appellant and  ISL was at arm's length.  We  reiterate  our view  that this  conclusion  is  not  borne  out of any misapprehension  of the  law  on  admissibility  and  veracity  of  documentary evidence.

Finally,  we wish  observe  in terms of the  provisions of section 94 and 96 of the Income Tax Act,  2004 the appellant was expected to  provide at the earliest all necessary information to clear the issues on the intercompany transactions  and  that the  respondent was  entitled  to  adjust the  assessment  based  on  its  best  judgment  and  information  reasonably

available.  In  the  premises,  the  appellant's  claim  that  it  was  not  asked  to provide  the  ten  invoices  would  not  advance  it  case.  That  said,  the  first ground of appeal fails.

The  complaint  in  the  second  ground  of  appeal  is  that  the  Tribunal erred  by  not  making  a  specific  finding  whether  or  not  Exhibit  R-l  was actually  proof  of  a  request  of  ten  invoices  from  the  respondent  to  the appellant. It is Mr.  Mtafya's contention here, on the authority of the decision of the defunct Court of Appeal for East Africa in Okeno v. Republic [1972] EA 32,  that the Tribunal,  being  the  first  appellate  forum,  should  have  re­ appraised  the  evidence  and  drawn  its  own  conclusion  particularly  on  the question  whether  Exhibit  R-l  was,  indeed,  proof of the  alleged  request of ten  invoices from the appellant by the respondent.  On the other hand,  Mr. Gugami countered that the ground under consideration presents question of law but a factual disputation contrary to section 25 (2) of the TRAA.

With  respect,  we think that the  allegation  that the Tribunal  failed  to re-appraise  the  evidence  on  record  or  that  it  misapprehended  it  would naturally  raise  a  valid  question  of  law.  However,  in  the  instant  matter  we are inclined to agree with the respondent that the Tribunal was alive to its

duty  to  re-examine  the  evidence  on  record.  It  examined  Exhibit  R-l  in tandem  with  the  other  exhibits. Its conclusion  on  the  issue  was  not exclusively  based  upon  one  documentary  exhibit  only.  We  wish  to  let  its conclusion, at page 1,300 of the record, speak for itself:

"The trial Board was therefore correct in its decision to rely on Exhibit R-l and aii other Exhibits A -l to  A-12 and also  to  make  reference  to  ten  (10) invoices  which  were  to  come  from  the  ten  (10) sampled  entries identified by the respondent's auditors and requested to be availed for verification. "[Emphasis added]

In consequence, we find the second ground of appeal lacking in merit. We dismiss it.

In respect  of  the  third  ground,  it  is contended  that  the Tribunal misinterpreted  section 13  of  the  TRAA  on the  procedures  for  handling objection proceedings when it held at 1,301 of the record that:

" From the foregoing if the appellant was  not comfortable with Exhibit R-l he should have produced  what  he  considered  to  be  the  correct sample of items/invoices requested by the

## respondent's  auditors  instead  of complaining  that Exhibit R-l is a mere internal document which came up in the WSD as Annexure TRA-2."

It  is  submitted  for the appellant that  before the  Board,  the appellant produced all documents that had been subject of the objection proceedings (that  is,  Exhibits  A-l,  A-2,  A-9,  A-10,  A - ll  and  A-12)  but  Exhibit  R-l  was not one  of the  documents.  The  latter  document only  surfaced  during  the proceedings before the Board well after the objection proceedings had been concluded.  It  is  thus  argued  that  the  Tribunal's  view  that  the  appellant should  have produced what it considered to be the correct sample invoices to  counteract  Exhibit  R-l  ignored  the  fact that the  appellant  only  became aware of that document upon being served with a copy of it as an annexure to the Written Statement of Defence in the Board.

For  the respondent, it was  posited  that  Exhibits  A-12  and  A-17 indicate  that  a  request  for  sample  invoices  by  the  respondent  from  the appellant  was  made  so  as  to  clear  the  issue  whether  the  intercompany transactions were at arm's length. That the correspondences involved were done  during  the  objection proceedings  and hence  in  accordance  with

section  13 (1) of the TRAA. It is thus disputed that Exhibit R-l was not part of the objection proceedings.

On  our  part,  we  do  not  find  any  basis  for  the  complaint  that  the Tribunal misconstrued  or  misapprehended  the  procedure  for  objection proceedings.  In  any  case,  the  thrust  of  this  ground  is  an  attack  on  the veracity or cogency of Exhibit R-l, implying that it raises a factual question. With  respect,  we  cannot  entertain  it  at  this  stage  as  it  will  necessitate  a review of the evidence on the  record.  We think that this impugned finding of  fact  is  binding  on  this  Court  and  cannot  be  appealed  against  under section 25  (2)  of  the  TRAA. In Bulyanhulu  Gold  Mine  Limited  v. Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, Consolidated Civil Appeals No. 89 and 90 of 2015 where we confronted an akin situation, we held that:

'We agree with the Tribunal that this was a question of fact  in  terms  of section  28(2)(b)  of  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Act ; the burden  of proof was on the appellant to prove that the said equipment was used wholly and exclusively for purposes of mining operations. In  the  finding of the  Tribunal,  the appellant had failed to discharge the burden.

This  being  a  question  of fact  it  ends  there. This is so, because under section 25(2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act (CAP 408 RE 2002) appeals  to  this  Court  lie  only  on  matters involving questions of law. So,  we find that the fifth ground is devoid of substance and we dismiss / £ .   "[Emphasis added]

In  consequence,  we  hold  that the third  ground  of appeal  lacks  merit.  We dismiss it.

The  essence  of the  fourth  ground  of appeal  is the  grievance  that  in applying the provisions of sections 33 and  35 of the Income Tax Act,  2004 while disallowing  15% of the costs of invoices, the Tribunal erred by relying only  on  documents  of the  respondent  issued  at  the  earlier  stages  of the objection proceedings  and not  considering  documents  supplied by  the appellant at a later stage of the proceedings as per section  13 of the TRAA. It  is  claimed  that  the  clarifications  provided  by  the  appellant  at  the  later stage (Exhibits A -ll and A-12) were not considered.

For the  respondent,  it  is  submitted  that the  disallowance was  based on the consideration by the Tribunal of Exhibits A-l, A-2, A-9 and A-10 that

the  issues  raised  in  Exhibits A-9  and  A-10  were  not cleared  sufficiently for settling the objections pursuant to Exhibits A -ll and A-12.

The fourth  ground  of appeal  need  not detain  us.  Like the  preceding ground,  this  ground  cannot  be  entertained  at  this  stage  as  it  seeks  to reopen  the  concurrent findings of the  tribunals  below on  the  disallowance by seeking a review of the evidence on the record. The fourth ground too is unmerited.

Next we deal with fifth ground. It is argued that the Tribunal erred for not  assessing  evidence  and  coming  up  with  its  decision  or  position  on whether or not it was proper for the Board to hold that reasons were given through the request of documents as opposed to the decision and whether the decision of the respondent had sufficient reasons. This grievance stems from  the  complaint  before  the  Board  that  the  respondent  did  not  give reasons  on  the  assessments  given  to  the  appellant.  It  is  argued  for  the appellant  that  although  the  Tribunal acknowledged  the  imperative  for decisions by public bodies such as the respondent to give reasons for their decisions  (see,  for  example, Tanzania  Air  Service  Ltd.  v.  Minister  of Labour and Two Others [1996] TLR 217), it should have been insufficient

for  the respondent  simply  saying  that  the  arrangements  between  the appellant and ISL were not at arm's length price.

On  the  other  hand,  the  respondent  acknowledges the  importance  of public authorities giving reasons for their decisions. However, it is contended  that  the  assessments  (Exhibits  A-l  and  A-2)  were  justified  as they were  backed  up with  reasons.  It was  not  necessary that the  reasons be sufficient or not.  It was added that the sample invoices from third  party suppliers submitted by  the respondent  were not  submitted or crossreferenced to ISL, resulting in the disallowance of 15% of the cost invoices.

With  respect,  we  are  at  loss  as  to  why  this  complaint  has  been rehashed as a specific ground of appeal before this Court.  Having examined the impugned assessments (Exhibits A-l and A-2), we noted that they were backed up with reasons. Whether the assigned reasons were justified or not was a  matter that had to be heard and determined  by the tribunals below. At any rate, we agree with the respondent that the main justification for the disallowance complained of was the absence of sample invoices from third party suppliers to clear the issue as to whether  the intercompany

transactions  in  question  were  at  arm's  length.  The  fifth  ground  of appeal stands dismissed.

It  is  argued  in  the  final  ground  of appeal  that the Tribunal  erred  by not considering the documents supplied by the appellant at a  later stage of the  objection  proceedings  thereby  failing  to  make  a  determination  on  a number of issues. That the Tribunal wrongly justified a disallowance of TZS. 709,870,107.00 on which  it did  not consider all  issues raised  in the appeal and that the respondent denied the appellant the right to be heard.  Having considered  this  matter,  we  hold  that  it  was  fittingly  answered  by  the respondent. The disallowance complained of arose from the appellant's own failure to submit the source of information having been requested to do so. Thus the  proposal  objection  settlement  (Exhibit A-9)  was  upheld.  We also hold that the alleged  denial  of the  right to  be  heard  is without  merit.  It  is evident from the  respondent's  proposal for settlement of objection  (Exhibit A.  10) at page 732 that reasons were assigned, which allowed the appellant to respond vide a  letter of 25t h  June,  2014, at page 735 of the record.  Like the  previous  grounds  of appeal,  this  one  too  is  devoid  of  substance.  We dismiss it.

In  a  nutshell,  the appellant's complaints basically invited the Court to reconsider,  reexamine  and  review the evidence  received  and  examined  by the  Board  and  the  Tribunal.  In  the  absence  of  any  misapprehension  of evidence  as  we  have  demonstrated  above,  we  cannot  venture  into  the waters due to the bar under the express provisions of section 25 (2) of the TRAA.

By way of a postscript, we feel enjoined to remark on somewhat inapt manner  in  which  the  grounds  of  appeal  were  framed.  The  grounds  are evidently discursive with  unnecessary  narratives and  quotations.  This  style adopted  by  the  appellant,  in  our  view,  flies  in  the  face  of  the  express provisions  of  Rule  93  (1)  of  the  Tanzania  Court  of  Appeal  Rules,  2009, which stipulate that:

"93-(l) A  memorandum  of appeal shall set forth concisely  and  under  distinct  heads,  without argument or narrative, the grounds of objection  to  the  decision  appealed  against, specifying  the  points  which  are  alleged  to have been  wrongly decided\ and the nature of the order which it is proposed to ask the  Court to make. "[Emphasis added]

The  use  of  narratives  and  quotations  in  the  present  appeal  has  had  no useful  purpose other than  clouding the thrust of the grounds of complaint against the challenged decision of the Tribunal.

The upshot of the matter is that the appeal is without merit. It stands dismissed with costs.
