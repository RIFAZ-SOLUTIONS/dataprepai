## Calculations for Capital Gains Tax

Here's a detailed scenario for a company operating in the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing sector and how different capital gains tax rates would apply:

## Scenario

## Company Profile:

-  Company Name: GreenFields Ltd.
-  Industry: Agriculture (Crop Production)
-  Location: Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
-  Business Activity: Cultivating and selling crops, including maize and beans.
-  Ownership: 100% Tanzanian-owned

## Transaction:

GreenFields Ltd. decides to sell a piece of agricultural land it owns. The land was purchased five years ago for TZS 200 million and is sold this year for TZS 300 million. This results in a capital gain of TZS 100 million.

## Calculation of Capital Gains Tax

## 1. Corporate Capital Gains Tax Rate

Since GreenFields Ltd. is a Tanzanian company, its capital gains are taxed at the normal Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate.

-  Assumption: The CIT rate is 30%.

Capital Gain:

TZS 100 million

Corporate Capital Gains Tax Calculation: Tax=Capital Gain×CIT Rate\text{Tax} = \text{Capital Gain} \times \text{CIT Rate}Tax=Capital Gain×CIT Rate Tax=TZS100,000,000×30%\text{Tax} = TZS 100,000,000 \times 30\%Tax=TZS100,000,000×30% Tax=TZS30,000,000\text{Tax} = TZS 30,000,000Tax=TZS30,000,000

So, GreenFields Ltd. would pay TZS 30 million in corporate capital gains tax.

## 2. Individual Capital Gains Tax Rate

For this scenario, individual capital gains tax rates do not apply because the transaction involves a corporate entity, not individual investors. However, for completeness, if an individual resident or non-resident had sold the land:

-  Resident Individual: The capital gains would be taxed at 10%.
-  Non-Resident Individual: The capital gains would be taxed at 30%.

## For Residents (if it were an individual transaction):

Tax=TZS100,000,000×10%\text{Tax} = TZS 100,000,000 \times 10\%Tax=TZS100,000,000×10% Tax=TZS10,000,000\text{Tax} = TZS 10,000,000Tax=TZS10,000,000

## For Non-Residents (if it were an individual transaction):

Tax=TZS100,000,000×30%\text{Tax} = TZS 100,000,000 \times 30\%Tax=TZS100,000,000×30% Tax=TZS30,000,000\text{Tax} = TZS 30,000,000Tax=TZS30,000,000

## 3. Sale of Mineral or Petroleum Rights

This scenario does not involve the sale of mineral or petroleum rights, so this rate does not apply. However, if GreenFields Ltd. had sold rights to mineral or petroleum resources, the applicable tax rate would be 30% on the capital gain.

## Summary

-  Corporate Capital Gains Tax for GreenFields Ltd.: TZS 30 million
-  Individual Capital Gains Tax (Resident): TZS 10 million
-  Individual Capital Gains Tax (Non-Resident): TZS 30 million

The corporate capital gains tax rate applied here reflects the general CIT rate, while individual rates vary based on residency status.

## Calculation of Capital Gains Tax

## 1. Corporate Capital Gains Tax Rate

Since RockMiner Ltd. is a Tanzanian company, its capital gains are taxed at the normal Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate.

-  Assumption: The CIT rate is 30%.

Corporate Capital Gains Tax Calculation: Tax=Capital Gain×CIT Rate\text{Tax} = \text{Capital Gain} \times \text{CIT Rate}Tax=Capital Gain×CIT Rate Tax=TZS300,000,000×30%\text{Tax} = TZS 300,000,000 \times 30\%Tax=TZS300,000,000×30% Tax=TZS90,000,000\text{Tax} = TZS 90,000,000Tax=TZS90,000,000

So, RockMiner Ltd. would pay TZS 90 million in corporate capital gains tax.

## 2. Individual Capital Gains Tax Rate

For individual transactions, if an individual resident or non-resident had sold the mining rights:

-  Resident Individual: The capital gains would be taxed at 10%.
-  Non-Resident Individual: The capital gains would be taxed at 30%.

## For Residents (if it were an individual transaction):

Tax=TZS300,000,000×10%\text{Tax} = TZS 300,000,000 \times 10\%Tax=TZS300,000,000×10% Tax=TZS30,000,000\text{Tax} = TZS 30,000,000Tax=TZS30,000,000

## 3. Sale of Mineral or Petroleum Rights

Since RockMiner Ltd. is selling mining rights, this falls under the special category for mineral rights, which is taxed at 30%.

Capital Gain:

TZS 300 million

## Capital Gains Tax Calculation for Sale of Mineral Rights:

Tax=Capital Gain×Special Rate\text{Tax} = \text{Capital Gain} \times \text{Special Rate}Tax=Capital Gain×Special Rate Tax=TZS300,000,000×30%\text{Tax} = TZS 300,000,000 \times 30\%Tax=TZS300,000,000×30% Tax=TZS90,000,000\text{Tax} = TZS 90,000,000Tax=TZS90,000,000

## Summary

-  Corporate Capital Gains Tax for RockMiner Ltd.: TZS 90 million
-  Individual Capital Gains Tax (Resident): TZS 30 million
-  Individual Capital Gains Tax (Non-Resident): TZS 90 million
-  Capital Gains Tax for Sale of Mineral Rights (for Corporate): TZS 90 million

In this scenario, the corporate tax rate is aligned with the standard CIT rate, while the special 30% rate applies to mineral rights, illustrating the specific tax treatment for different types of transactions.
