## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

l 5th   &amp; 2 4 th   March,  2022

## LEVIRA. J.A.:

The appellant, National Bank of Commerce Ltd (NBCL) is challenging the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) in Tax Appeal No. 34 of 2018 which dismissed its appeal against the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board), in favour of the Respondent. The contention in that appeal was centred on the respondent's imposition of  withholding  tax  on  payment  made  by  the  appellant  in  respect  of services  by  non-resident  entities  as  well  as  rentals  paid  in  respect  of various lease agreements.

It is desirable that we look at the facts of  the case before we embark on the grounds of appeal presented before us. According to the record of appeal, in the year 2012, the respondent conducted an audit on the tax affairs of the appellant.  Upon such audit, the respondent discovered that the appellant made certain payments to non-resident persons in respect of services supplied to the appellant by the non-resident entities as well as on rentals on various sale agreements. As a  result, the  respondent imposed  withholding  taxes  on  those  payments  and  rentals  which  in essence aggrieved the appellant.  Therefore,  the appellant preferred an appeal to the Board which was registered as Income Tax Appeal No. 91 of 2013.

Before  the  Board  four  issues  were  raised;  to  wit, first, whether payments made by the appellant for services performed outside Tanzania by  non-residents are subject to withholding  tax; second, whether the respondent took into consideration withholding tax remittances on rental payments when making withholding tax demand; third, whether in the circumstances, imposition of interest is correct in law; and fourth, what reliefs each party is entitled to. Having heard the appeal, the decision of the Board was partly in favour of the respondent and partly the parties were  ordered  to  reconcile  accounts;  specifically,  remittances  allegedly

made by the appellant. Dissatisfied, the appellant appealed to the Tribunal where it was discovered that the Board did not make a specific finding on two issues, namely; whether the payments made by the appellant to its offshore  service  providers for services  performed  outside Tanzania  are subject  to  withholding  tax  and whether  the  respondent  took  into consideration withholding tax remittances on  rental  payments in raising the  withholding  tax  demand. Based  on  the  available  evidence  and submissions presented before the Board, the Tribunal decided to step into the shoes of the Board to determine the undecided issues together with other grounds of appeal.  However,  the Tribunal  found  the  appellant's appeal lacking in merits and dismissed it right away.

Still  aggrieved,  the  appellant  has  preferred  the  present  appeal challenging the decision of the Tribunal. It has to be noted that initially, the  appellant  filed  a  Memorandum  of Appeal  containing  five  grounds. Later,  it  sought  and  obtained  leave  of the  Court  to  file  an  Amended Memorandum  of Appeal.  However,  during  hearing  of the  appeal,  the counsel for the appellant abandoned other grounds of appeal appearing in the said Amended Memorandum of Appeal and argued only one ground which reads: -

"(1)  The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in  iaw in stepping into the shoes of the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board  and  determine the issue relating to imposition of withholding tax  for  payments made by the  Appellant to offshore  entities  suo  motto without  affording  the parties an opportunity to be heard contrary to Article 13 (6) (a) of  the Constitution of  the United  Republic  of Tanzania 1977".

The parties filed written submissions containing arguments for and against  the  above  ground  of  appeal  which  were  adopted  by  their respective learned counsel  during  hearing  of the appeal. The appellant was represented by Mr. Wilson Mukebezi, assisted by Mr. Alan Kileo and Ms. Emma Lyamuya, all learned advocates; whereas, the respondent had the  services of  Mr.  Harold  Gugami,  learned  Senior  State Attorney,  Mr. Hospis Maswanyia, also learned Senior State Attorney and  Ms. Salome Chambai,  learned  State Attorney. Mr.  Mukebezi  and  Gugami,  learned counsel argued for and against the appeal respectively.

Submitting in support of the appeal,  Mr.  Mukebezi stated that the parties to this matter had a dispute regarding withholding tax remittance on rental  payments made by the appellant to non-resident persons.  He further referred us to page 298 of the record of appeal arguing that, the Board failed to make specific findings on the issue presented before it as it said, there was a big confusion as to which tax bases are legitimate in respect of the appeal.

He went on submitting that the services were performed in Tanzania where  the  respondent  said,  they  were  remotely  being  rendered  from offshore. In that regard, he argued, the Board ended up saying that the appellant did not adduce evidence to that fact. Ultimately, the Board did not make any finding in that respect, instead, it ordered the parties to sit and find solution.

Following failure by the Board to determine issues presented before it,  the  appellant filed  an  appeal  before the Tribunal. The appeal  was disposed of by way of written submissions filed by the appellant; but the respondent filed none.  The counsel for the appellant referred us to page 336 of the record of appeal where the Tribunal made a finding that, the Board did not make a specific finding on the issue whether the payments made  by  the  appellant  to  its  offshore  service  providers  for  services performed outside Tanzania are subject to withholding tax and whether the  respondent took  into consideration  withholding  tax  remittances on rental  payments  in  raising  the  withholding  tax  demand.  The  learned counsel submitted that with that finding, the Tribunal upheld the appeal to that extent and quashed the decision of the Board.

Mr. Mukebezi submitted further that as a way forward, the Tribunal stepped  into  the  shoes  of the  Board  and  determine  the  dispute  after having  considered that the  matter was an  old  one. Another reason for taking such measure was that the Tribunal was sitting as a first appellate court and thus, was entitled to evaluate the evidence independently and could come to its own conclusion. It was the argument by the counsel for the appellant that, the  Tribunal made its own findings and made a decision on a matter which was not before the Board.  He referred, us to page 338 of the record of appeal and argued further that, the Tribunal relied on the decision  of  the  Court  in Tullow  Tanzania  BV.  v.  Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No. 24 of 2018 (unreported) to resolve that the  services  rendered  outside Tanzania  are  subject to  withholding  tax while that was not the dispute before the Board.

According  to  him,  the  parties  were  fighting  on  the  place  where services were rendered and not whether the withholding tax is paid to the services rendered outside Tanzania.  He again referred us to page 139 of the  record  of  appeal  and  submitted  that  part  of  a  Memorandum  of Discussion found on that page shows that there were various items which were kept together and it shows that some of the services were rendered in  Tanzania  and  others  offshore. He  was  firm  that,  there  was  no discussion  regarding  withholding  tax  issues. He further referred  us to pages 311-314 of the record of appeal, particularly, at paragraph 8 of the appellant's written submission in support of  the appeal before the Tribunal where  he  said  that,  the  appellant  did  not  argue  anything  regarding substantive issues.  Therefore, it was his argument that the  Tribunal erred by  not  calling  the  parties  to  submit  on  the  substantive  issues.  He distinguished the case of Hassan Mzee Mfaume v. Republic [1981] TLR 167 relied by the Tribunal from the present case saying that, in that case, the High Court evaluated the evidence having found that the same was not evaluated properly by the court below; while in the current case, the Tribunal did not evaluate the evidence but applied Tullow's case and gave a decision.

The counsel for the appellant went on to argue that the appellant produced documents before the Board to prove remittances,  which the Tribunal wrongly determined that they were produced in contravention of Rule 15(4) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board Rules 2001 G.N. No. 57 of 2001 (now repealed).  The said Rule required all the evidence to be relied upon by the Board first to  be made available to the  respondent in the notice of objection. He thus argued, the Tribunal was not supposed to make such a finding.

It is worth noting that the counsel for the appellant indicated in the written  submission  presented  before  us  that,  the  appellant  does  not dispute the Tribunal's decision to step into the shoes of the Board and determine the dispute.  What is disputed is that in stepping into the shoes of the  Board, the Tribunal  did  not bother to call the  parties and  afford them the right to address it on the issue of withholding tax which was raised suo motto. He submitted further that the Tribunal was wrong to determine  issues  which were not even raised by  the parties for determination without giving them an opportunity to be heard. Therefore, he prayed for the appeal to be allowed.

In reply, Mr. Gugami commenced his submission by referring us to page 146 of the record of appeal where issues framed and agreed upon before the  Board are found, with a view of showing the Court that the issue of withholding tax was  not introduced  by the Tribunal  but it was among  the  issues  before  the  Board.  The  first  issue  reads:  " Whether payments made by the appellant for  services  performed  outside Tanzania by a non-resident are subject to withholding tax. "He went on submitting that at page 152 of  the record of appeal, the appellant stated in its written submissions  to the  Board  that,  the  payments  for  services  which  were rendered from  offshore are  not subject to withholding tax  in Tanzania.

He thus  faulted  the  submission  by the  counsel  for  the  appellant who submitted  that  the  main  issue  before  the  Board  was  on  the  place  of performance of the services.

The learned counsel for the respondent insisted that from page 148 to 177 of the record of appeal, the main argument by the parties before the Board was on whether the services were subject to withholding tax. However, he said, when the matter was presented before the Tribunal on appeal, it found that the said issue was not fully determined and is when it  stepped  into  the  shoes  of the  Board  and  determine  it  as  it  can  be observed from page 335 to 336 of the record of appeal.

As regards the issue whether the parties were afforded the right to be heard,  Mr. Gugami submitted that having stepped into the shoes of the Board, the Tribunal relied on the submissions of  the parties before the Board and made its finding from page 336 to 339 of the record of appeal. According to him,  it is misleading for the appellant to claim that parties were not given the right to  be  heard  because there was  no new issue discussed and or determined by the Tribunal.  He insisted that the parties were afforded the right to be heard as the Tribunal evaluated the evidence as indicated at page 340 of the record of appeal where the Tribunal was quoted saying: 'We have seriously considered the rival submissions by the learned counsel for the appellant and the respondent respectively. We have also taken note of  the documents which the appellant is relying on."

Mr. Gugami insisted, it was sufficient that the Tribunal relied on the evidence tendered  before the  Board to determine the dispute  between the parties as it was in Hassan Mzee Mfaume v. Republic (supra) cited with approval by this Court in The Registered Trustees of Joy in the Harvest  v. Hamza  K.  Sungura, Civil Appeal No. 149  of  2017 (unreported).

In  conclusion,  the counsel  for the  respondent submitted that the Tribunal  did  not determine issues which were  not placed  before it and there was no need to recall the parties to make submission because they had  already  been  given  that opportunity  by the  Board. Therefore,  he prayed for the appeal to be dismissed with costs.

Mr. Mukebezi made a rejoinder to the effect that the Tribunal ought to  have called the parties to  make clarification on  which services were rendered in Tanzania and which were performed offshore.  However,  he admitted that from page 173 - 177 of the record of appeal, parties made clarification  before  the  Board  but  the  appellant  thought  the  Tribunal needed  more  clarification  on  the  issue  because  the  law  had  already

changed when the Tribunal was deciding the matter. Citing section 17(2) of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  Cap  408  R.E.  2010,  he  vehemently submitted that the Tribunal was supposed to call parties so as to reach a just  decision.  When  responding  to  the  question  posed  by  the  Court regarding the first issue agreed at the  Board found at page  149 of the record of appeal, the counsel for the appellant stated that the Tribunal did not decide it properly.  He thus reiterated his prayer that the appeal be allowed.

We have dispassionately considered a relatively long submission by the  parties.  We  appreciate  that  various  issues  have  been  touched, especially,  by the appellant's counsel.  However, for the purpose of this appeal we shall direct our mind on a sole issue which is a center of the appellant's  complaint;  whether  the  Tribunal suo motto introduced  the issue relating to imposition of withholding tax on payments made to non­ resident persons for services performed outside Tanzania and decided it without affording the parties a right to be heard.

To start with, our thorough perusal of the record of appeal together with the submissions by the counsel for parties do not suggest that there was any  new  issue  raised  and  decided  by the Tribunal. The  record  of appeal is very clear that before the Board parties agreed on four issues for determination as follows: -

- (i) Whether  payments  made  by  the  appellant  for  services performed outside Tanzania by non-residents are subject to withholding tax;
- (ii) Whether the respondent took into consideration withholding tax  remittances on rental  payments when making withholding tax demand;
- (iii) Whether  in the circumstances,;  imposition o f  interest  is  correct in law; and
- (iv)  What  reliefs each  party is entitled to.

The  Board  considered  the  evidence  adduced  before  it  and  the submissions  by the  parties to  reach  its decision  where the appeal  was partly allowed. However, we agree with the appellant that the Board saw a  big  confusion  as to  which  tax  bases are  legitimate  in  respect of the appeal while dealing with the first issue as it can clearly be seen at page 214 of the record of appeal. As a result, it failed to determine that issue as correctly,  in  our view,  found  by the Tribunal.  When the appeal  was placed before the Tribunal and after having discovered that the Board did not decide on the first issue despite being in possession of the necessary materials which would assist in doing so, the Tribunal decided to step into the shoes of the Board to decide that issue. It should be noted that from

page 148 to 176 of the record of appeal, the parties before the Board got the  opportunity  to  clarify  on  all  the  issues  which  were  raised.  The appellant filed written submission in which it discussed thoroughly the first issue from page  150 to  152 of the record of appeal. Since the Tribunal was sitting as the first appellate court and after having discovered that the first issue was not determined by the Board, it decided to step into the shoes of the Board and decide on it.

It can further be noted that among the grounds of appeal  presented before  the  Tribunal  was  that: "The  Board erred in  law for failure  to properly determine the  issues  before it. "Constructively, the appellant was inviting the Tribunal to step into the shoes of the Board and determine those  issues,  a  task  which  we  think,  was  correctly  performed  by  the Tribunal. As intimated above, the appellant is not challenging the act of the Tribunal stepping into the shoes of the Board to decide issues raised before it. The only grievance is that the parties were not given the right to  be  heard  on  the  issue  of  withholding  tax  in  respect  of  services performed outside Tanzania by non-residents. The question that follows is  whether  it  is  correct  under  the  circumstances  of  this  case  for  the appellant to claim that parties were not afforded the right to be heard on the issue which was raised before the Board.

It is settled law that when rights and duties of any person are being determined by the court or any other agency, that person shall be entitled to a fair hearing which  is construed to mean a  right to  be heard  - see Article  13(6) (a) of the Constitution of the United  Republic of Tanzania 1977 (as amended).

Coming to the issue  we  have  raised,  parties to this appeal  have raised rival arguments regarding this issue. While the appellant's counsel strongly argued that parties were  not given the  right to  be heard,  the respondent's counsel submitted to the contrary. It can be noted from the submission  by the  counsel  for  the  appellant that,  although  initially  he forcefully argued that the parties were not afforded the right to be heard by the Tribunal on the first issue which was raised before the Board, and that the said issue was raised suo motto by the Tribunal, he forgot that the said issue was raised by the appellant as one of the grounds of appeal before it. Also, before the Tribunal the appellant presented three grounds, to wit:

- (1) That  the Board  erred  in  law  and  in  fact  by disagreeing with the appellant's arguments that the payments for which the respondent is seeking to impose withholding tax  are in respect  of  services performed  offshore  by  non-residents on  mere

assumption that the services could have been performed in Tanzania.

- (2) That  the Board  erred  in law  and  in fact  by  failure to  hold that the respondent  did  not take into account withhotding tax remittance on rentals made by the appellant in  making the  withholding tax demand after agreeing  that  the  evidence  of withholding  tax remittance  was  availed  to  the  respondent  and  the respondent can easily  access it. [Emphasis added].
- (3) That  the  Board  erred  in  law  for  failure  to  properly determine the issues before it. [Emphasis added].

The only  issue  proposed  by the  appellant and  determined  by the Tribunal in dealing with the above grounds of appeal was:  " whether the Board  determined  the  issues  arising  from  the  appeal  correctly." In answering this issue, the Tribunal confined itself on the issues which were raised before the Board. In the course of determining the said issues, it discovered that the Board did not deal with the first issue which was raised before it.  Being  guided  by the decision  of defunct East Africa  Court of Appeal  in Hassan  Mzee  Mfaume v.  Republic (Supra)  the  Tribunal stepped  into the shoes of the  Board and evaluated the evidence which was tendered  before  it to  arrive to  its decision.  To  appreciate  parties'

arguments for and against the issue under consideration we wish to quote part of the Tribunal's decision hereunder: -

"From the Board's  proceedings and  judgment  it is revealed that the appellant's contention was that the payments made  to its non-resident service providers had no source in  the  United Republic because  the  services  were performed offshore, that is outside the country.  Of  course, there was dispute  between the appellant  and  the  respondent as regards which services were  performed  outside the country  and which services were  performed  in the country."

## The Tribunal went on stating that: -

"The issue which we have to resolve is whether the payments made by the appellant to its non­ resident service providers  had a  source  in  the United  Republic.  That  takes us to the  provisions of section  69(1)  (i)  of the Income  Tax Act,  2004. That section provides ....  We therefore hold that irrespective of the place of rendering service as the payments in this appeal were made by the appellant (NBC), who is a resident  in Tanzania for services utilized in the United  Republic, then the issue whether  payments  made  by  the appellant  for  services  performed  outside Tanzania  by  non-resident  are  subject  to

withholding tax is answered in the affirmative. The payments made are subject to withholding  tax under the provisions of section 6(1) (b), 69(1) (i) and  83(1) (b) of  the  Income Tax Act, 2004."

[Emphasis added].

The decision of the Tribunal was based on the materials which were presented by the parties to answer all the three issues which were raised before the Board. In the circumstances, the appellant cannot claim that it was  not  accorded  the  right  to  be  heard;  as  correctly,  in  our  view, submitted by the counsel for the respondent. We have observed from the arguments of the counsel for the appellant before us that, the appellant was  not  satisfied  with  the  decision  of the Tribunal.  In  the  concluding remarks,  as  shown  above,  he  ended  up  saying  that the Tribunal  was required to receive further clarification from the parties so as to arrive at a just decision. At any rate, dissatisfaction of a party to a suit does not justify  a   claim  of denial  of a  right  to  be  heard;  whether  the Tribunal needed further clarification or otherwise does not amount to denial of a right to be heard as the counsel for the appellant would wish us to decide. In our settled view, the appellant's claim  is unfounded and it is nothing but an afterthought. To prove this, with respect, it can be observed from the submission  by the counsel  for the appellant above that he tried to

touch various issues to justify his claim. However, he ended up conceding that the parties were accorded the right to be heard but only fact that, they needed to make more clarification forgetting that the Tribunal did what  was  supposed  to  be  done  by  the  Board.  With  this  remark,  we therefore find that the parties were given the right to be heard and the appeal has no merit.

Consequently, we dismiss the appeal with costs.
