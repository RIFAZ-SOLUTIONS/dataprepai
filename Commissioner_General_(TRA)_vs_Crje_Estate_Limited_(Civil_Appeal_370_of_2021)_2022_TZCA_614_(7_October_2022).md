(Appeal from the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal at Dar es Salaam)

dated the 7th   day of September, 2021 in Tax Appeal  No. 67 of 2019

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

30h September, &amp; 7th October, 2022

## MAIGE, J.A.:

The respondent, CRJE Estate Limited, a construction company duly incorporated under the laws of Tanzania, entered into an agreement, in 2008 with Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation for construction of a commercial building in Dar es Salaam. It is common ground that, the project, the subject of the  dispute,  was  registered  with  the Tanzania  Investment Centre  (TIC)  in  December,  2008 and a certificate of incentive  under section  17  of the Tanzania  Investment Act  [Cap.  38  R.E.  2019],  (the TIA) was granted to the respondent in January 2009 and which was subsequently, extended as per exhibits A4 and A7, to November, 2018.

In  carrying  out  the  project,  the  respondent  imported  various deemed capital goods unto which the appellant approved 100% import duty exemption pursuant to the respective certificate. Of significance to note is the fact that; until 2009 when the certificate of incentive in exhibit A3 was being issued, the law in terms of section  19 (1) of the TIA read together with section 4(4) (a) of Customs Tariff Act,  1976 (CTA) provided for zero import duty for deemed capital goods in respect of an  investor with  a  certificate  of incentive. Besides,  under section 19(2) of the TIA, the benefits attached with the certificate could neither be amended nor modified during the five years period of the certificate. In 2012, section  19 of the TEA was amended by the Finance Act No. 8 of 2012 to the effect of introducing  the provision of subsection (4) which restricted the import duty exemption granted to deemed capital goods to 90%. Again, the  same provision was further amended by Finance Act No. 4 of 2013, so that the exemption granted to an investor holding a certificate of incentive in respect of deemed capital goods was restricted to 75%.

In 2017, having procured the extension of the certificate as per exhibit  A7,  the  respondent  wrote  to  the  TIC  on  the  status  of  the

exemption  after  the  amendment.  The  latter  officially  informed  the former as  per exhibit  A8  that,  the  amendment  did  not  affect  the investors  who  were  already  implementing  their  projects.  On  further inquiry to the appellant, the respondent was informed that under the amendment brought by Finance Act of 2013, the respondent was obliged to  pay 25%  import  duty. As  a  result,  the  appellant  served  the respondent  a  demand  notice  in  exhibit  A10  for  payment  of  TZS 2,268,636,778.63. The appellant maintained the same position notwithstanding the respondent's application for review. Being aggrieved, the respondent appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the  Board).  The  Board  having  heard  the  appeal  and  considered  the provision of section  19(2) of the TIA in line with the amendment, was of  the  opinion  that,  the  amendment  in  question  did  not  affect  the benefits created before its coming into forth. In particular, it observed as follows:

" Thus,  as no amendments either through legislative enactment  or  otherwise made within five years  from the date o f  issuance o f  the certificate of  incentives could affect  the  benefits  granted  to the  appellant  (the i nvestor), then we are satisfied  that, the amendment of  section 19(2) o f  the Tanzania Investment  Act,  1997 as introduced by the Finance Act 2013 does not apply

## to  the  project  that  was  registered on  8P January, 2009."

The  appellant  was  not  pleased with  that  decision. She  thus appealed, to the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the  Tribunal), raising in essence three complaints. One, the Board was wrong in holding that the  respondents  tax  benefits  under  the  certificate of  incentive  in question were not affected by the amendment of the law. Two, the Board was wrong  in  holding  that the  respondent was entitled to the respective benefits  under the TIA and the CTA without due regard that, the  latter  phased  out  of  existence  in  2004  when the  East  African Community Customs Management  Act, 2004 (EACCMA) became operational in Tanzania. Three, the Board was wrong in not taking into account that, the benefits under section 19(1)  of the TIA was meant for strategic and major investors as per section 20 of the same Act. In its well -reasoned decision, the  Tribunal dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the Board.

On the first complaint,  the Tribunal  upheld  the  decision  of the Board  on three grounds. First, the certificate of incentive issued to the respondent constituted an agreement between the respondent and the Government  which could not, in terms of  section 19(2) of the TIA, be

amended  or  modified  during  its  five  years  at  the  detriment  of the investor. Second, the changes brought by the Finance Act, 2013 could not  operate  retrospectively  as  to take  away  the  benefits  that  the respondent was already enjoying. Three, the certificate could  not be affected by the changes which introduced the concept of strategic and major investors because the  intention of the amendment was merely to provide for additional  benefits. On the second complaint, the Tribunal having held as a fact that, the provisions of EACCMA was binding and was to take precedence over the domestic laws, was of the view that, its  existence  did  not  render  the  provisions  of  CTA which  has  been consolidated with Customs (Management and Tariff) Act, [Cap. 203 R.E. 2019], (CMTA), non- existent. If we can quote, the Tribunal observed as follows:

"We  have  read  and  re-read  the above  quoted provisions o f the law and we entirely agree with the submission o f the appellant's counsel that following Tanzania's membership in the East African Community, it is mandatory to apply the East African Community  Customs  Management Act,  2004  in  ail importation of  goods and where there is an inconsistency  it  is  the  said  Act  which  shall  take precedence. We  however, wish  to  insist  that  the

precedence o f  the said  Act  is oniy  on matters to which its  provisions relate'.

Having observed as above, the Tribunal further stated that:

"/4s correctly submitted by the respondent's counsel the EACCMA, 2004 does not  have or  contain provisions relating  to  exemptions granted to  capita! goods  or deemed capital goods and even the learned counsel for  the  appellant  did  not  refer  us  to  any  such provisions.  It follows  that the provisions relating  to exemptions  granted  to capital  goods  or  deemed  capital goods are contained in the Partner State's respective custom laws which did not cease to exist when the EACCMA, 2004 came into force"

On the third complaint, the Tribunal reiterated its resolution of the first complaint and added:

"As  correctly  opined  by  Mr. Gonzi,  Member  o f the Tribunal, that each certificate o f  incentive is a separate agreement between the investor and the government and it has its  own  terms and conditions as  well as privileges granted to the investor or the given project for  the  given  time. Further  that  the  certificate  o f incentive issued  under  the law  must  be  protected  by  the law and if   subsequent laws have added more benefits to strategic and major investments (investors) holding certificate of  incentives, that would  not  operate retrospectively  to  deprive  the  rights  and  privileges legally acquired and enjoyed prior to  the laws being passed."

The appellant,  still  unhappy with the concurrent decision  of the Board and the Tribunal lodged the instant appeal. In the memorandum of appeal,  the appellant  criticized the decision of the Tribunal on seven grounds.  However, at the hearing, the appellant abandoned the third, sixth and seventh grounds and as a result, the appeal is now founded on the following grounds:

- 1. The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the amendments of  section 19(4) o f the Tanzania Investment Act  by  the Finance  Act, 2013 could  not  apply  to the respondent who was a holder o f a Certificate o f  Incentive issued by the Tanzania Investment Centre on 8P January, 2009 in contravention o f  section 19(4) o f  the Tanzania Investment  Act (Cap. 38) (as amended by the Finance  Act, 2013.
- 2. The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law and fact in holding  that  each Certificate of  Incentive  is  a  separate agreement between the investor and the Government and it has its own terms and conditions as well as privileges granted to  the  investor  o f the  given  project  for  the  given  time,  in contravention and disregard o f  section 19(1) and 19 (4) o f  the Tanzania Investment  Act (Cap.38) as well as Clause B.  12 (1) of  the Public Standing Orders, 2009 in which it is required  that,

all  Government Contracts should  be scrutinized  and  drafted  by the Attorney General's Office.

- 3. The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law and fact in holding that the respondent is entitled to 100% import duty exemption under the Customs Tariff  Act, 1976 in total reliance of the certificate  o f incentive granted to  the respondent in 2009,  thus  contravening  article  39  (2)  o f the  East Africa Community Customs Union Protocol, 2004 and section 253 o f the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004 which requires Tanzania to apply the East African Community Customs Management  Act, 2004 in a ll customs matters.
- 4. The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law and fact in holding  that the  appellant has no power to  take  away  the benefits  granted  to the  respondent  under  the Tanzania Investment Act,  1977 and the Customs Tariffs Act,  1976 and thereafter  proceeding to  grant  the respondent with the benefits granted to Strategic and Major Investors while the respondent is  neither  o f  the two, contrary  to section 19(2) and 19(4) o f  the Tanzania Investment  Act,

At the hearing of  the appeal, the appellant was represented by Mr. Moses Kinabo, learned Principal State Attorney whereas the respondent was  represented  by  Dr.  Erasmo  Nyika  and  Ms.  Hadija  Kinyaka,  both learned advocates.  Unlike the respondent, the appellant did not file any written submissions as he opted to address the Court in terms of rule

106(10) (b) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules, 2009. In  his oral submissions, Mr. Kinabo reduced the grounds of appeal into two issues and submitted accordingly. The first issue is whether the amendment brought by the Finance Act, 2013 applied to the tax demand in question and second is whether the TIC in granting the certificate acted for and on  behalf of the  Government.  For the  respondent,  Ms.  Kinyaka  who made the oral submissions  adopted the written submissions  and briefly addressed the two issues. We commend the counsel for their brilliant submissions which have been very instrumental  in composition of this judgment.  Having so remarked, we shall hereunder direct our mind to the two  issues  raised,  starting,  for obvious  reasons,  with  the  second issue.

Addressing the second issue, Mr. Kinabo started by criticizing the Tribunal in holding that, a certificate of incentive is  an agreement while in law such a document constitutes a mere evidence of illegibility of an investor to enjoy tax exemptions. In the alternative, it was his contention that, if  at  all,  a  certificate  of  incentive  under  discussion was  an agreement as observed  by the Tribunal, yet it would  be invalid  and ineffectual for want of involvement of the Attorney General as per the provisions of clause B-12 (1) of the Public Service Standing Orders, 2009

which requires  all agreements  involving the Government  to be scrutinized and drafted by the Attorney General. In addition, it was his argument  that,  since  Tanzania  is  governed  by  the  rule  of  law,  the agreement in the certificate of incentive, in so far as it was violative of the  amendment  brought  by  the  Finance  Act,  2013,  was  void.  The counsel finally urged us to answer the issue negatively.

Submitting  in  rebuttal on the issue,  Ms. Kinyaka who made the submissions for the respondent  supported the decision  of the Tribunal that a certificate of incentive is an  agreement between the Government and the investor. She substantiated her argument with section 17 (7) of the  TTA and  the  principle  in Vodacom  Tanzania  Public  Limited Company vs. Commissioner General, TRA, Civil Appeal No.  107 of 2020 (unreported). She did not agree with the appellants submissions that, the Attorney General was not involved  because under section 5(2) (c)  of the HA, the Attorney General is a part of the TIC. In any event, she  submitted,  a  certificate  of incentive  being  conclusive  evidence  of validity of its contents, it was upon the appellant to adduce evidence in proof of non- involvement of the Attorney General.

In  rejoinder,  Mr.  Kinabo  maintained  the  same  position  that  a certificate of incentive is not an agreement.  He urged the Court not to rely on the Vodacom case (supra), because the issue therein, unlike in the instant one, pertained to Income Tax Act.

We  have tentatively  followed  the  counsel's  submissions  on  the issue. It raises two questions. First, whether a certificate of incentive is an  agreement  between  the  Government  and  an  investor. Second, whether the  Attorney  General  was  consulted  before  issuance  of the certificate.  The  first question  should  not  detain  us  because  it  was conclusively  addressed in the Vodacom case (supra)  where,  it was observed:

7/7 the same vein, the issuance o f new certificates, that is certificate No. 110016/01 dated 14/3/2005 and No.  110016/01  dated 14/3/2006 by the  TIC in  our settled opinion, constituted a new agreement under the  provisions  o f  the  above  subsection o f  the  2004Act. Therefore, as  rightly  held  by  the Tribunal, the certificates were dearly in respect of  a new i nvestment, separate from the initial one under which the first  sets o f  certificate were issued.  Thus,  with the i ssuance o f  new certificates by the  TIC under section 17(1) o f  the TIA and section 143 (4) o f  the 2004 Act, the parties (Appellant and Respondent) had entered

## into a new agreement concluded in the pendency of the 2004  Act."

Much  as  it  is  true,  as  Mr.  Kinabo  submitted  that,  the  benefits involved in the said authority were in respect of  deduction of expenditure under the Income Tax Act, 2004, while the one at issue is exemption of import duty in respect of deemed capital goods under CTA, we are of the view that, in as long as it deals with a certificate of incentive under section  17  of the  TIA,  the  authority  is  relevant  in  the  instant  case. Therefore, just like the Tribunal, we hold that, the certificate of incentive in dispute constituted an agreement between the Government and the respondent as an investor.

Whether the  Attorney  General  was  involved  in  making  of the certificate in question, we agree with Ms. Kinyaka, is a new factual issue which is coming for the first time in this appeal and, therefore,  does not qualify as a ground of appeal to the Court. This is in accordance with Section 25(2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act which requires appeals to the  Court in  tax  matters to  be  confined  to  legal  points only. In  any event, the  TIC  being a statutory institution owned by the Government, whether the requirement under the Public Service Standing Orders was complied with or not, is an administrative and management affairs within

the  Government  which  would  perhaps  fall under  the  domain  of administrative law. It cannot, as rightly contended for the respondent, be resolved  by having a look at the certificate itself in isolation of other relevant information within the knowledge of the appellant and the TIC itself. We shall therefore, not take the said complaint into our account. As a result, we answer the second issue against the appellant.

We  now  turn  to  the  first  issue  as  to  the  applicability  of  the amendment  brought  by  the  Finance  Act,  2013  in  the  respondent's importation of deemed capital goods between 2014 and 2018 as per the appellant's demand notice in exhibit A10. In determining the issue, Mr. Kinabo has invited us to apply a strict rule of statutory interpretation. He has placed reliance on our authority in Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited  vs.  Commissioner General TRA, Civil  Appeal  No.  426  of 2020 (unreported). The principle in question and its relevancy in the instant  case,  it  would  appear  to  us,  have  not  been  doubted  by  the counsel  for the  respondent both  in their written submissions and oral arguments.  We  shall  thus  be  guided  by  the  said  principle  in  our resolution of this particular issue wherever appropriate.

The submissions of Mr. Kinabo on the issue was brief but precise. It was to the effect that; since the tax in dispute was in respect of the

goods imported between 2016 and 2018 when the amendment law was already in force, the appellant was not only entitled but obliged to collect the respective import duties in accordance with the amended law. In that regard, the counsel strongly contended that, the issue of the said law being applied retrospectively does not arise as it is express in the Finance Act, 2013 that, the same was operational as of 31s t July, 2013. In the same spirit, he submitted that, the five years protection in the old law, cannot apply because they were intended for strategic and major investors under section 20 of the TIA. In any event, he submitted, the CTA under which the exemption was granted,  had ceased to apply in Tanzania on 2n d  March, 2004 when the country signed the  Protocol on the  Establishment  of  the  East  African Customs  Union,  2004  (the Protocol).

To the contrary,  Ms.  Kinyaka was of the contention that section 19(4)  as  amended  by  the  Finance  Act,  2013  did  not  apply  to  the certificates of incentive issued  before the operational  date on  1s t July, 2013, since under section 19(2) of the TIA, the benefits granted to the investor  under the  respective  certificate  could  not  be  taken  away  by legislative changes. She relied on the interpretation of the said provision by  the  Tribunal  in  the  case  of Commissioner  General,  TRA  vs.

Vodacom Tanzania  Limited, Civil  Appeal  No.  17 of 2010  where it was held as follows:

"We  agree  entirely  with  these propositions. The Appellant had no power to  take  away the  benefits granted to an investor under  section 19(1) o f  the TIA. Indeed even a legislative amendment cannot do so."

In rejoinder, Mr. Kinabo submitted that, the amendment protected under section 19 (2) is in respect of a certificate itself and not the tax benefits. The issue of retrospective effect of the amendment, he submitted,  is  irrelevant  because  the  tax  demand  was  in  respect  of importation  made  after the  amendment. As the  amendment was  in force  when the importation was being made, he added, the application of the amendment law was not a matter of discretion.

We agree in the first place that, under section  19(2) of the TIA, the  benefits  granted  in  a  certificate  of  incentive  to  an  investor  can neither be amended nor modified during five years of the certificate at the  detriment of the  investor.  The  rationale  behind  is  express  in  the provision.  It  is  "to  create  predictable  investment  climate"  which  is necessary in promoting capital investment.

From  the  record,  there  appears  to be  three  certificates  of incentive in this case. The first certificate was granted on 8th  January, 2009  (exhibit A3). The second  one was granted  on  13th   March,  2013 (exhibit A4) whereas the last one was issued in September, 2016 (exhibit A7). The submissions by Ms.  Kinyaka on this issue is that, the three certificates in law constitute one certificate. To her, the certificates in exhibits A4 and A7 constituted mere extension of the project in exhibit A3.  This  is  why,  she  submitted,  the  period  of implementation  of the project  in all the three certificates is dated way back in 2008 when the project was registered. This, she clarified, is implied by the fact that, the two subsequent certificates bear the same registration number with the original certificate in exhibit A3.  She thus urged us to take it that, the certificate of incentive in question has been in existence since 2009 and, therefore, the  appellant was already enjoying  its  benefits,  when the new law was being enacted.

We have considered the rival submissions very carefully in line with the law. The issue, in our view, revolve around the benefits an investor enjoys under section  19(1) of the T1A  and its protection under section 19(2) of the same law.  The two provisions under which the two rights are provided for, had kept the same wordings notwithstanding the 2012

and  2013  amendments.  They are  reproduced  hereunder for easy of reference:

"19(1) A  business  enterprise  in  respect o f which  a certificate is   granted under this  Act  shaii  be entitled  to the benefits  which are applicable  to  that enterprise under  the  provisions  o f the  Income  Tax  Act, the Customs Tariffs Act, the Valued  Added Tax Act, or o f any other written law for the time being in force".

(2) For  the  purpose of  creating a predictable investment climate, an investor to whom a Certificate has  been  issued  shall  be  entitled  to  the  benefits referred to  under subsection  (1)  and such  benefits shall not, during the  period  o f  five years from the date o f  i ssuance o f  such Certificate be  amended  or  modified to the detriment o f  the investor"

In  2012  and  2013  amendments,  it  is  undeniable,  the  benefits under subsection (1) was amended, by the new provisions of subsection (4),  by  restricting the exemptions for import duties in deemed capital goods  to  90%  in  the 2012  amendment  and  75%  in  the  2013 amendment. That  is  where  the  dispute  lies.  The  protection  under subsection (2) was not expressly altered by the 2013 amendment.  Mr. Kinabo contents  that, the said provision has implicitly been affected in that; the benefits and protection therein are only available to strategic

and major investors under section 20 of the TIA. With all respects to the learned counsel, we have repeatedly examined the two amendments and  we  could  not find  any  provision through which  we  could  imply discriminatory application of the benefits between strategic and  major investors on  the one  hand  and  ordinary  investors with  certificates of incentive on the other. We, therefore, share the same view with  the Tribunal that, the benefits introduced  under section 20 of the TIA for strategic and major investors were,  until  2013, merely additional and not derogatory to those created under  section 19(1) and (2) of the TIA.

Parties appear to have a common understanding as to when the 2013 amended law came into operation. They both agree that,  it was on  1s t  July,  2013.  Equally so,  they are  not,  at least,  at this  particular juncture, in dispute that, a law affecting substantive rights like this, does not operate retrospectively unless it is express in the amendment  law, which  is  not. This  is  in  line  with  the  authority  in Municipality  of Mombasa vs. Nyali Ltd (1963) E.A. 371 which was referred in Bidco Oil  and  Soap  Ltd  vs.  Commissioner General, Tanzania  Revenue Authority,  Civil  Appeal  No.  89  of  2009  (unreported),  where  it  was observed:

"Whether or not legislation  operates retrospectively depends  on  the  intention  o f the  enacting  body  as manifested by the legislation.  In seeking to ascertain the  intention  behind  the  legislation  the  courts  are guided by certain rules o f construction.  One o f these rules is that if   the legislation affects substantive rights it would  not  be  construed  to  have  retrospective operation  unless  a  dear  intention  to  that  effect  is manifested; whereas if   it affects  procedure only, prima facie it operates retrospectively unless there is a good reason to the contrary".

We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that, the amendment brought by the Finance Act, 2013 did not operate retrospectively as to affect the respondents prior benefits under section 19(1) as protected under section 19(2) both of the TIA. The Tribunal was, thus, quite  right in  holding that, the  benefits attached with the respondent's certificate of incentive could neither be amended nor modified during the five years period of the certificate.

The  obvious question that follows and onto which the parties are contentious is when do we count the five years protection period from. The discussion here involves, in our view, the question of whether the certificates  in  exhibit  A4  and  A7  constituted  an  integral  part  of  the

certificate  in  exhibit A3  or  each  of them  constituted  a  separate  and different agreement.  Admittedly, there is no clear expression in the TIA as to the status of the original certificate and what the respondent calls extended certificates.  Ms.  Kinyaka  has urged  us to have a  look at the provisions of section 17(2) of the HA. Our reading of  the provisions does not resolve the question however. For, section 17 (2), (3) and (4) speaks of three kinds  of investments for which a certificate of incentive can be sought  namely;  new  investment, rehabilitation  or  expansion  of  an existing investment and equity investment.

Perhaps, an extension of the implementation period of a certificate of  incentive  would  fall  under  amendment  and/  or  modification  of a certificate by the TIC under section 17(12) of the TIA which provides as follows:

"(12)  Where the Centre is satisfied that a change or variation has occurred as provided in subsection (8) in respect o f  a certificate issued under this  Act, the Centre shall amend the certificate to take into account the change or variation."

In light of the above provision, we would agree with Ms. Kinyaka that, the certificates in exhibits A4 and A7 amended the initial certificate in exhibit A3 with the effect of extending the implementation period of

the  project  to  November,  2018. In Vodacom  Tanzania  Public Limited Public Limited Company (supra), we distinguished between  an  expansion  and  extension  of the  project  in  relation  to  a certificate.  In  a former  situation,  we  remarked,  a  new and  separate contract is created while in the latter the same certificate remains.  In particular, we stated as follows:

"Regarding  the  above  position, in  our  opinion, the Tribunal  rightly  determined  the  application  o f  the Certificate o f  Incentives  granted to the appellant under section 17(1) o f  TIA as  an extension o f2000agreement while others created  a new  agreement  entered  in 2005. Certificate  No.  110016/01  dated 14/3/2005 and No. 110016/01 dated  14/3/2006 were in relation to incentives under the 2004Act.  Therefore, Certificate o f Incentive issued in 2005 was a new certificate and not an extension o f  the previous ones as contended by the appellant. This  is  evidenced by  the  wording  o f the certificate itse lf  as  it   uses the word "expansion"  and  not " extension" as it appears in the previous certificates. This  position is supported  by the provision o f  section 3 of the  TIA  which  defines  investment  to  mean  and include "the expansion, restructuring or  rehabilitation o f an existing enterprise".

Applying  the above  principle  in  the  instant case,  we  hold  that, since the certificate of incentive in exhibit A4 which was issued in March, 2013  extending  the  implementation  of  the  project  in  exhibit  A3, preceded the Finance Act, 2013 which came into force in July, 2013, the said amendment did not operate retrospectively as to affect the benefits attached to the said certificate under section 17(1) of the TIA. Neither did the  Finance Act,  2012 do to the original  certificate of incentive in exhibit A3.  As the five years period protected under section 17(2) of the TIA was still  intact when the importation  under discussion took place, the respondent, as rightly advised by the TIC in exhibit A8, was entitled to 100% exemption under the old law as concurrently held by the Board and the Tribunal.

There  was  also  a  submission  that,  the  CTA  under  which  the relevant tax benefits were applicable, had ceased to apply from March, 2004 when Tanzania signed the Protocol with the effect of binding itself to the provisions of the EACCMA on all issues pertaining to import and export duties.  On  this,  Ms.  Kinyaka  did  not  have  much  to  say than, capitalizing to what the Tribunal held. She did so having considered that, the counsel for the respondent has not referred to any provision in the EACCMA providing for import duties on deemed capital goods as it is the

instant case in as much  he could  not refer to any provision rendering the CTA disapplied. The Tribunal, we have noted, having held that the provisions of  the EACCMA  is applicable in Tanzania and takes precedence to the extent of the matters its provisions relate observed at page 1582 as follows:

"As correctly submitted by the respondent's counsel, the  question  which  arises is  whether the  EACCMA, 2004  contains  provisions  relating to exemptions granted to  capital goods or deemed capital goods? Again,  as  correctly  submitted  by  the  respondent's counsel, the EACCMA, 2004 does not have or contain provisions relating  to  exemptions granted to  capital goods or deemed capital goods and even the learned counsel for the appellant did not refer us any such provisions.  It follows  that the provisions relating  to exemptions  granted  to capital  goods  or  deemed  capital goods are contained in the Partner States respective customs law which did not cease to exist when the EACCMA, 2004 came into force"

We  have  taken  time  to  very  carefully  examine  the  relevant provisions of the law.  Just as the Tribunal, we are of the position that; as the CTA which  has  been  consolidated with  the CMCTA,  has  never been  repealed and  because the EACCMA does not have any provision

relating to import duty exemption in respect to deemed capital goods by a holder of a certificate of incentive under the TIA, the certificate of incentive  in  question  was  not  invalid  as  alleged  by  the  appellant's counsel.
