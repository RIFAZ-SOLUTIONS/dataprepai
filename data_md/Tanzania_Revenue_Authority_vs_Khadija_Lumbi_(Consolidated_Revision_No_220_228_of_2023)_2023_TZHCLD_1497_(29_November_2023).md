Brief  facts  of  this  application  are  that,  on  24 th June  1996,  the Tanzania Revenue Authority(hereinafter referred as the employer), the applicant  in  revision  No.  220  of  2023  and  respondent  in  revision application No.  228  of  2023  employed  Khadija  Lumbi  (hereinafter referred to as the employee), the respondent in revision application No. 220 of 2023 and applicant in revision No. 228 of 2023.  It is undisputed by  the  parties  that  the  employer  employed  the  employee  as  customs guard. It is further undisputed that one of the duties of the employee was  inspection  of  imported  vehicles  together  with  documentations thereof  at  Dar  es  Salaam  port.  It  is  further  undisputed  by  the  parties that, on 19 th December 2007, the employer terminated employment of

the employees based on misconducts and that on 3 rd January 2008, the employee filed labour dispute No. CMA/DSM/KIN-ILA/106/09. It is also undisputed by the parties that on 7 th January 2010, Hon. E. Mwidunda, arbitrator, as he then was, issued an award in favour of the employee that  termination  was unfair and ordered the employer to reinstate the employee without loss of remuneration. It is further undisputed by that the  employee  filed  execution  No.  362  of  2013  before  this  court  for enforcement of the said CMA award. It is also undisputed that, during hearing of the said execution application, the employer, stated inter-alia that  she  was  unwilling  to  reinstate  the  employee  rather,  was  ready  to pay  her  twelve(12)  months  salaries  in  lieu  of  reinstatement  but  the employee stated inter-alia that she was entitled to be reinstated without loss  of  remuneration.    On  11 th April  2014,  Hon.  S.S.  Sarwatt,  the executing  officer,  the  Deputy  Registrar,  as  she  then  was,  agreed  with the employer in compensating the employee 12 months salaries in lieu of reinstatement.

On 13 th April 2017, Mr. G.S. Ukwong'a advocate for the employee filed at CMA the Notice of application for clarification of the award issued in dispute No. CMA/DSM/KIN-ILA/106/09 as a result, the said application

was  assigned  ref.  No.  CMA/DSM/KN/R.151/17.  The  said  notice  was supported by an affidavit affirmed by the employee.

On the other hand, the employer filed the counter affidavit sworn by  Moses  Mabamba  wherein  he  stated inter-alia  that,  the  award  was issued  on  7 th January  2010  and  that  the  same  have  been  executed through cheque No. 00058676 by payment of salaries from the date of termination  to  the  date  of  the  award  and  12  months  compensation  in lieu of reinstatement. It was further deponed on behalf of the employer that  the  award  is  clear  and  has  been  interpreted  by  the  Honourable Registrar Sarwatt on 11 th April 2014 in execution No. 362 of 2013.

On 17 th August 2023, Hon. Mbena, M.S, Arbitrator, having heard the  parties  issued  a  ruling  with  Ref.  No.  CMA/DSM/MISC/65/2021  in which  she  indicated  that  she  clarified  the  award  and  ordered  the employer  to  pay  the  employee  TZS  35,315,020/=  being  12  months' salary  compensation  and  25  months  salaries  from  December  2007  to January 2010.

The  employer  was  aggrieved  with  the  said  ruling  hence  filed Revision  No.  220  of  2023.  In  the  affidavit  of  Jacqueline  Chunga,  the employer raised two grounds namely:-

- 1. The Hon.  Arbitrator erred in law and  fact in holding that the respondent (employee) is entitled to TZS 35,315,020/= being the total cost  for  compensation  of  twelve  (12)  months  salaries  and  twentyfive(25) month's salary due from the date of termination i.e., December 2007 to September 2009.
- 2. The  Hon.  Arbitrator  erred  in  ignoring  the  facts  that  the  Respondent (employee)  remained  in  the  payment  system  (payroll)  continued  to receive  salary  from  TRA  from  December  2007  to  September  2009 despite the evidence tendered justifying the same.'

On the other hand, the employee was also aggrieved with the said ruling as a result she filed Revision Application No. 228 of 2023. In the affidavit in support of the Notice of Revision, the employee raised four issues namely:-

- 1. Whether  the  respondent(employer)  have  legally  implemented  the award that was issued on 7 th January 2010.
- 2. Whether implementation of an award by the Commission for Mediation and Arbitration can be implemented at the leisure of the respondent(the employer) in disregard of the time frame.
- 3. Whether  or  not  the  award  issued  on  7 th January  2010  revived employment of the applicant (employee) and
- 4. To what reliefs are the applicant (employee) entitled to.

By consent of the parties, this consolidated revision was argued by way  of  written  submissions.  In  the  said  written  submissions,  the employer enjoyed the service  of  Jacqueline  Chunga  from  legal  service department while  the  employee  enjoyed  the  service  of  G.S.  Ukwong'a advocate.

In her written submissions on behalf of the employer, Ms. Chunga submitted  that,  the  award  of  TZS  35,315,020/=  being  12  months compensation and 25 months from December 2009 to January 2010 to the  employee  is  unjust  because  the  employee  continued  to  receive salary from December 2007 to  September 2009. She submitted further that  TZS  11,594,468/=  that  was  calculated  by  the  employer  includes salary  from  October  2009  to  January  2010  and  12  months'  salary compensation. It was further submitted on behalf of the employer that payment  of  TZS  35,315,020/=  that  includes  salaries  from  December 2007 to September 2009 will amount to double payment and cited the case of Ronald Ufoo Muro vs. AIM Steel Ltd , Labour Revision No. 73 of 2018,  HC,  Arusha(unreported)  to  support  her  submissions.  She concluded that the employer proved that the employee continued to be paid salary from December 2007 to September 2009 and that she is only entitled to be paid TZS 11,594,468/= in lieu of reinstatement.

Responding to submissions by the employer, Mr. Ukwong'a counsel  for  the  employee  submitted  that  payment  of  the  employee's salaries  and  other  benefits  were  supposed  to  be  made  within  14  days from the date of the award. He further submitted that the arbitrator did not  consider  the  provisions  of  section  40(3)  of  the  Employment  and

Labour  Relations  Act[Cap.  366  R.E  2019]  in  ordering  the  employer  to pay  25  months  salaries  when  she  made  interpretation  of  12  months payable to the employee. He added that letter by the employer dated 5 th February 2010 showing that she will only pay the employee 12 months' salary compensation in lieu of reinstatement is of no impact because it was written outside the 14 days within which the employer was required to satisfy the award. He went on that the cheque dated 1 st day of March 2010 was also not served to the employee as a result the later remain unpaid as a result the amount unpaid is 156 months and not 25 months ordered by the arbitrator in her ruling.

I should point out that the employer did not file rejoinder.

On the other hand, it was submissions of the employee in revision No. 228 of 2023 that, the award that was issued on 7 th January 2010, was definite, certain, and concise as a result, no appeal or revision was preferred by the employer. He went on that, the action that remained was  implementation  or  execution  of  the  said  award.  It  was  further submissions  by  counsel  for  the  employee  that,  employer  implemented the  award  by  writing  a  letter  and  issuing  a  cheque  well  out  of  time hence the said implementation was void. Counsel submitted further that, in the award, the employee was reinstated hence her employment was revived. To support his submissions, counsel cited the case of Tanzania

Harbours  Authority  vs.  Wendeline  Ledger, Civil  Appeal  No.  8  of 1986,  CAT(unreported)  because  the  employer  failed  to  implement  the award within 14 days from the date of the award. He further cited the case  of Paul  Solomon Mwaipyana vs NBC Holding Corporation , civil Appeal No. 68 of 2001 in which the Court of Appeal discussed the provisions  of  section  24(1)(b)  of  the  Security  of  Employment  Act  and held that the employer had no choice where reinstatement is ordered. Counsel for the employee further cited the provisions of section 40(3) of Cap.  366  R.E.  2019(supra)  and  strongly  submitted  that  the  arbitrator erred because the employee was not served with a letter denying her reinstatement.  He  added  that  the  said  letter  was  written  after  the  14 days has expired. He went on that the employer did not notify CMA her decision of not reinstating the employee. Counsel for the employee also submitted that the award revived employment of the employee and that reinstatement  was  confirmed  after  expiry  of  14  days  set  out  as  time frame  in  the  award.  He  submitted  further  that,  to  date,  the  employer has  not  terminated  the  employee  hence  the  later  remains  as  an employee of the former. He also submitted that the employee is entitled to accrued salaries including increments, pension, leave and all benefits due to her employment contract. Counsel for the employee concluded

by  praying  the  court  to  quash  the  decision  by  the  arbitrator  and  the award issued to the employee be given the right and just interpretation.

Resisting revision No. 228 of 2023 filed by the employee, counsel for  the  employer  reiterated  what  she  submitted  in  relation  to  revision No.  220  of  2023  that  was  filed  by  the  employer.  Counsel  for  the employer  added  that,  the  employee  filed  execution  No.  99  of  2010 before the High court and that a cheque valued TZS 11,594,468/= was issued  in  favour  of  the  employee  in  presence  of  Mr.  Chaburuma, advocate for the employee, as a result, on 7 th June 2010, Hon. Karua, Registrar  marked  the  matter  as  settled.  She  submitted  further  that, thereafter the employee filed civil application No. 44 of 2010 challenging constitutionality of section 40(3) of Cap. 366 R.E. 2019 on payment of 12 months' salary compensation in lieu of reinstatement but the same was dismissed  on  11 th November  2011.  She  added  that  the  employee filed  Civil  Appeal  No.  92  of  2012  before  the  Court  of  Appeal  but  she withdrew  it.  Counsel  for  the  employer  submitted  further  that  after withdrawal of the said appeal, the employee filed execution No. 262 of 2013 in which Hon. Sarwatt, Deputy Registrar as she then was, agreed with  the  decision  of  the  employer  of  paying  the  employee  12  months' salary  compensation  in  lieu  of  reinstatement.  She  went  on  that  the employee  filed  Revision  No.  410  of  2015  challenging  legality  and

correctness  of  the  decision  in  Execution  No.  362  of  2013  but  the  said revision was  dismissed  on  18 th November  2016.  She  added  that, thereafter the employee filed execution No. 40 of 2017 that is pending in court but later on she filed an application for clarification of the award at CMA.  Counsel  for  the  employer  prayed  the  application  by  the employee be dismissed on ground that she acted negligently as she did not collect the cheque and payment of TZS 11,594,468/= as 12 months' salary  in  lieu  of  reinstatement.  She  cited  the  case  of ONGC Ltd  vs. M/s. Modern Construction and Co. , Civil Appeal Nos. 8957-8958 of 2013 in the supreme Court of India and concluded that the employee is only entitled to be paid TZS 11,594,468/=.

Again, the employee did not file rejoinder submissions.

When I was composing my judgment, I noted that the notice of application for Notice of application for clarification of the award issued in dispute No. CMA/DSM/KIN-ILA/106/09 was signed by G.S. Ukwong'a advocate and not Khadija Lumbi, the employee. I further noted that, in her  ruling,  the  arbitrator  considered  matters  that  were  neither  part  of the employee's affidavit nor employers counter affidavit rather, were in submissions of the parties. With those observations, I resummoned the parties  to  address  whether  there  was  a  competent  application  for clarification before the Hon. Arbitrator and whether it was proper for the

arbitrator  consider  matters  that  were  not  either  in  the  affidavit  of  the employee  or  the  counter  affidavit  of the employer.  I  decided  to resummon the parties because these issues were not covered in their written submissions.

Responding  to  the  issues  raised  by  the  court,  Mr.  Urso  Luoga, State  Attorney  for  the  employer  and  the  Attorney  General  submitted that,  the  application  was  incompetent  because,  Rule  29(3)  of  Labour Institutions(Mediation and Arbitration)Rules, GN. 64 of 2007 requires the notice of application be signed by the party bringing the application. He went  on  that,  the  notice  was  signed  by  the  advocate  who  is  not  the applicant.

On the 2 nd issue, Mr. Luoga submitted that, it was wrong for the arbitrator to consider matters not either in the affidavit or the counter affidavit. He added that, the arbitrator issued a ruling that has an effect of  revising  the  award  that  was  issued  by  Mwidunda,  arbitrator.  He concluded that, the arbitrator has no power to revise the award of the fellow arbitrator  because revisional powers are reserved to the Labour Court only.

Responding  to  the  issues  raised  by  the  court,  Mr.  Geoffrey Ukong'a, Advocate for the employee submitted that, it is true that the notice of application for clarification was signed by an advocate. Counsel

submitted that, the advocate had power to sign the said notice because he was instructed by the respondent/employee to file an application on her behalf. In his submissions, counsel conceded that in the CMA record there is no notice of representation showing that respondent appointed the advocate who signed the said notice of application for clarification.

Responding to the 2 nd issue  raised by the court, counsel for the employee  submitted  that,  in  the  ruling  for  clarification,  the  arbitrator considered all  documents that were annexed to both the affidavit and the counter affidavit. Counsel submitted further that, matters that were raised  by  the  parties  in  their  submissions  are  not  evidence.  In  his submissions,  Mr.  Ukong'a,  learned  counsel  for  the  employee  conceded that  in  the  impugned  ruling,  the  arbitrator  did  not  give  clarification, rather,  gave  a  ruling  that  departed  from  what  was  awarded  by  her fellow arbitrator.

I have considered submissions of the parties on the issues raised in their respective revision application and those raised by this court.  In disposing this consolidated revision, I wish to start with issues that were raised by the court.

There is no dispute, as it was observed by the court and correctly submitted by the parties that the Notice of application for clarification of

the award issued in dispute No. CMA/DSM/KIN-ILA/106/09 was signed and filed by Mr. G.S. Ukwong'a, advocate for the employee. It is clear from the CMA record that, on 13 th April 2017, Mr. GS Ukwong'a advocate for the employee filed at CMA the Notice of application for clarification of the award issued in dispute No. CMA/DSM/KIN-ILA/106/09 as a result, the said application was assigned ref. No. CMA/DSM/KN/R.151/17. The said notice was supported by an affidavit affirmed by the employee. In the said notice of application for clarification, the learned counsel for the employee indicated that applicant intends to apply for orders that:-

- '1.This Honorable Comission be pleased to make an order for clarification of the award in Dispute No. CMA/DSM/KIN ILA/106/09 and determine the rights of the applicant who to date has not been reinstated and not paid salaries hence award remaining unsatisfied.
- 2.  The  grounds  upon  which  the  reliefs  above  have  been  sought  are more  so  set  in  the  affidavit  of KHADIJA  LUMBI the  applicant herein'.

In support of the said notice, Khadija Lumbi, the employee,  filed an affidavit with 7 paragraphs wherein she stated:-

'1. …

- 2.  That  on  the  7 th day  of  January  2012  the  Commission for Mediation and  Arbitration  in  Labour  Dispute  No.  CMA-DSM-KIN\_ILA-106-09 entered an award in my favour and the same to date has not been executed…

- 3. That an attempt to execute the award in the High Court proved futile because the taxing master imposed his own award hence failure of the process. Annexed marked 'B' is the copy of the ruling and a copy of a cheque of the respondent unilaterally issued purporting to settle the award forming part thereof.
- 4. That I have filed further application for execution of the award in the High Court of Tanzania Labour Division and the matter is pending…
- 5. That upon letting my advocate learn about this I was advised which advice I believe to be true is that the duty to determine and interpret the award is that of the Commission hence this application.
- 6.  That  in  the  interest  of  justice  let  the  Commission  arrange  for necessary  interpretation of the award  so  as  to determine  the quantum of the claim and to enable me execute the award.
- 7. That this Commission has the power under the relevant provisions of the law cited to grant the orders sought.'

Counsel for the employee indicated that the said Notice was made under  Rule  29  of  the  Labour  Institutions(Mediation  and  Arbitration) Rules, GN. No. 64 of 2007 and Rule 8 of the Labour Institutions(Ethics and Code of Conduct for Mediators and Arbitrators)Rules, GN. No. 66 of 2007.

I have read the above cited provisions of the law specifically Rule 29 of GN. No. 64 of 2007 (supra) and I  agree with submissions by the learned  State  Attorney  on  behalf  of  the  employer  and  the  Attorney General that, the Notice of application was not properly signed. I am of that view because, the notice was signed by the advocate and not the person filing the application. Rule 29(2) and (3) of GN. No. 64 of 2007

(supra)  provides  clearly  as  who  should  sign  the  Notice  of  Application.

The said Rule provides:-

'29(2) An application shall be brought by notice to all persons who have an interest in the application.

- 3. The party bringing the application shall sign the notice of application in  accordance  with  Rule  5  and  shall  contain-…' (Emphasis is mine)

It  was argued by Mr. Ukong'a, learned counsel for the employee that,  he  signed  the  said  notice  to  seek  clarification  because,  he  was instructed by the employee. That submission cannot be correct because it  is  not  supported by evidence on record as it was correctly conceded by  counsel  for  the  employee.  In  his  submissions,  counsel  for  the employee conceded that, there is no notice of representation that was signed by the employee appointing him to be her advocate. Since that evidence  is  wanting  in  the  CMA  record,  I  find  that  the  Notice  to  seek clarification  was  improperly  signed.  Technically  there  was  no  proper notice  or  application  that  was  filed  at  CMA  seeking  clarification  of  the award  that  was  issued  on  7 th January  2010,  by  Hon.  E.  Mwidunda, arbitrator.  For  the  foregoing  I  find  that  all  proceedings  that  were conducted  by  Hon.  Mbena,  M.S,  arbitrator,  is  a  nullity  and  the  ruling arising from those proceedings cannot stand.

Apart from that, on 7 th January 2010, Hon. E. Mwidunda, arbitrator, issued an award in favour of the employee that termination was unfair and ordered the employer to reinstate the employee without loss  of  remuneration.  The  said  award  was  not  challenged  by  the employer, instead, the employer opted to pay the employee 12 months' salary  compensation  in  lieu  of  reinstatement.  The  employee  did  not accept payment of the said 12 months' salary as compensation in lieu of reinstatement. That is the source of the application for clarification that was filed by the employee at CMA and led to issuance of the impugned ruling hence this application.

I  have  read  the  impugned  ruling  and  find,  as  it  was  correctly submitted by both counsel, that the arbitrator altered totally what was awarded  to  the  employee  on  7 th January  2010  by  Hon.  E.  Mwidunda, arbitrator.  In  the  impugned  ruling,  the  Hon.  arbitrator  ordered  the employer  to  pay  the  employee  TZS  35,315,020/=  being  12  months compensation and 25 months from December 2009 to January 2010. It was correctly in my view, submitted by the parties, that the said ruling revised the award that was issued by her fellow arbitrator. That was an error  on  part  of  the  arbitrator  because  revision  of  CMA  award  is  the domain of the Labour Court. In short, the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to revise the award that was issued by her fellow arbitrator.

Again,  the  application  that  was  before  the  arbitrator  was  for clarification as indicated in the hereinabove quoted notice of clarification. The said application was not for calculation. It is my view that, in calculating and awarding the employee TZS 35,315,020/= to be paid 12 months compensation and 25 months from December 2009 to January  2010,  the  arbitrator  went  beyond  what  was  prayed  by  the employee  in  her  application.  I  am  of  that  view  because  in  both  the above  quoted  notice  of  clarification  and  the  above  quoted  affidavit  in support  of  the  said  notice  of  clarification,  there  was  no  prayer  for calculation of the amount payable to the employee. It is my considered opinion that, synonyms of clarification is not calculation. Therefore, the arbitrator  did  not  confine  herself  within  the  ambit  of  the  Notice  of clarification  and  affidavit  of  the  employee  in  support  thereof,  instead, she overshot and went ahead to calculate the amount that was payable to the employee. Worse, in the said calculation, she included the period after the award was issued by Mwindunda, arbitrator and the period the employer alleges issued the cheque for payment of 12 months' salary in lieu of reinstatement but allegedly the employee refused to accept it. At any  rate,  that  was  not  an  issue  of  clarification.  If  anything,  it  was  a matter  of  argument  by  the  parties  during  execution  stage  before  the Deputy  Registrar,  who,  in  terms  of  section  87(4)  and  89(2)  of  the

Employment and Labour Relations  Act[Cap.  366  R.E.  2019]  and  Rules 48(3) and (4) and 49(1) of the Labour Court Rules GN. No. 106 of 2007, is the executing officer. In making calculations as to the amount payable to  the  employee,  the  arbitrator  assumed  and  performed  the  duties  of the executing officer while she was not.

For all what I have discussed hereinabove, I find that the issues that  were  raised  by  the  court  has  disposed  the  whole  application.  I therefore find unnecessary to discuss issues raised by the parties in this consolidated revision.

For  the  foregoing,  I  hereby  nullify  CMA  Proceedings,  quash,  and set aside the ruling arising therefrom.

Dated at Dar es Salaam on this 29 th November, 2023.
