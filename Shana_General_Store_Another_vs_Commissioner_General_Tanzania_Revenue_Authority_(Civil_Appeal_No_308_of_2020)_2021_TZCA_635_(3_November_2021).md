Tax Appeal No. 15 of 2019

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

20th  October &amp; 3r d  November, 2021.

## MWAMBEGELE, J.A.:

The  proceedings  and  record  of  this  appeal  are  rather  confusing. What we are  not sure  of is  if this confusion  is  not a  deliberate  act  by the appellants. Despite the fact that it is not clear who was or were supposed to  be the appellants in the  matter right from the  level  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals  Tribunal,  it  is  not  clear  why  this  appeal  refers  to  two  appellants while it is only one appellant who lodged a  notice of appeal. What will  be demonstrated in this judgment will undoubtedly reveal why we so raise this

concern. We  however,  at this  stage  wish  to  state  some  facts  leading  to what we think is a confusion.

The  parties  at  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  were Shana General Store Limited as the first appellant and Shana General Store as the second appellant, on the one hand and the Commissioner General of Tanzania  Revenue Authority,  on  the  other,  as  the  respondent.  The  Board decided in favour  of  the  Commissioner  General  of  Tanzania Revenue Authority, the respondent then and herein.  Aggrieved, a notice of intention to appeal  was lodged to the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal). The  same  appears  at  p.  151  of the  record  of appeal. While  it  refers  to Shana General Stores Limited and Shana General Stores as "the appellant" in  both the title and the body, it refers to Shana General Stores Limited and Shana  General  Limited  as  "the  appellants"  in  the  Statement  of  Appeal appearing  at  p.  153  of  the  record  of appeal  but  whose  body  shows  that "the  particulars  of the  appellant"  are  Shana  General  Stores  Limited;  only one appellant.  The proceedings of the Tribunal (p. 251), the judgment and decree thereof,  pp.  284 - 304 and  pp.  305 - 306,  respectively,  show only one  appellant,  Shana  General  Stores  Limited.  It  is  also  important to  note that the appeal before  the  Tribunal was  argued by way  of  written

submissions in which the appellant's advocate refer to two appellants while the respondent refers to only one appellant, Shana General Stores Limited.

Be  that as  it  may,  the Tribunal  decided  in  favour  of the  respondent then  and  in  this  appeal  as  well,  the  Commissioner  General  of  Tanzania Revenue  Authority. Undaunted,  a notice  of  appeal to this Court  was lodged.  It  appears  at  p.  307  of  the  record  of  appeal.  It  is  only  Shana General Stores Limited who lodged that notice.  Shana General  Stores does not feature. However,  the  memorandum  of appeal  shows two appellants, Shana  General  Stores  as  the  first  appellant  and  Shana  General  Stores Limited as the second appellant. Likewise, the appellants in their communication  with  the  respondent  have  been  using  the  names  of  the appellants  interchangeably.  They  would  refer  to  them  as  SGS,  SGSL  or sometimes as simply Shana  General.  This ailment went on  even  after the respondent warned SGSL of not going on with this malpractice through her letter  bearing  Ref.  No.  A.B.  209/2/10/01/1  dated  27.10.2014  appearing  at p.  37 of the record of appeal.

We shall address this confusion and its outcome on the appeal before us at a  later stage in this judgment. For the sake of convenience, we shall refer to the  parties as,  simply,  Shana  General  Store  (SGS),  Shana  General

Store  Limited  (SGSL)  and  the  Commissioner General  of Tanzania  Revenue Authority (the respondent).

At this stage,  we find  it apt to  narrate the  material  background facts to this appeal as they can be gleaned from the record of appeal. SGSL is a company  incorporated  in  Tanzania  with  Tax  Identification  Number  (TIN) 104-975-380  issued  on  18.09.2006,  appearing  at  p.  36  of  the  record  of appeal  (Exh.  A2).  Its  principal  shareholder  is  Abdallah  Iddi  Mshana  who also operated, and perhaps  still operates, a business  entity; SGS, a business  name  under  which  he  traded,  with  TIN  100-167-476  issued  on 01.07.1999, appearing at p. 35 of the record of appeal (Exh. Al).

It happened that in the month of November, 2013, SGS, using SGSL's TIN,  imported  in  Tanzania  goods  from  Candy  Kenya  Limited,  a  company based  in  Kenya.  The  goods  were  certified  by  Kenya  Revenue  Authority (KRA) as originating  from  Kenya.  The  relevant certificate appears at p.  1 3 of the record of appeal and was received in evidence as Exh.  P5.  Basing on the certificate of  origin, the goods  were  declared in the Pre-Arrival Declaration  Form  (PAD)  No.  3914129 which appears at p.  16 of the record of  appeal (Exh. P6), as exempted  from  customs  duty. However,  on 02.12.2013,  despite  the  PAD,  the  respondent  assessed  the  goods  for import duty  at a  tune  of Tshs.  38.691,240/=.  The  respondent was of the view that the goods were not exempt from customs duty in that they were manufactured  using  raw  material  under the  remission  scheme  in  the  East African  Community  (EAC)  and  thus  meant  for  export  outside  the  EAC, otherwise,  if imported  within,  they  were  to  be  subject to  normal  customs duty.

The  respondent  stuck  to  his  guns  despite  a  series  of Abdallah  Iddi Mshana's complaints and follow-ups. Having seen that the complaints and follow-ups  did  not  bear  any  positive  results,  on  behalf  of  SGSL,  the  said Abdallah Iddi  Mshana,  lodged a  review  under the provisions of section 229 (1)  and  (2)  of  the  EAC  Customs  Management  Act,  2004  (the  EACCMA). However, the  respondent did  not  respond  to the  review within  thirty days as  required  by subsection  (5) to section  229 of the  EACCMA as a  result of which SGSL appealed to the Board  by filing a  notice of intention to appeal under section  16 (1) and  (3) of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act, Cap.  408 of the  Revised  Edition,  2002  (the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act)  and  rule  4  (1) and  (4) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board  Rules,  2001 as amended by GN No.  366 of 2009 (at p. 6 of the record of appeal).  Thereafter, SGSL lodged a  Statement  of  Appeal  which  appears  at  p.  7  of  the  record  of  appeal. However,  upon  mature  reflection,  SGS was joined  as the second  appellant as appearing in the Amended Statement of Appeal at p. 31 of the record of

appeal. The  main  ground  in  the  Amended  Statement of Appeal  was that the  imported  goods were exempt from  tax  as they were  of Kenyan  origin as certified  by KRA and that they should therefore be accorded preferential tariff in   terms of section  111  of the EACCMA. The Board decided in favour of the  respondent. An appeal to the Tribunal was thus barren of any fruit hence the present appeal before us.

This appeal is premised on the following six grounds:

- 1.  That the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  holding that  the  goods  imported  by  the  appellant  are  liable  to  duties and taxes under Article 25 (2) (b) of the East African Community  Customs  Union,  2004  whereas  the  certificate  of origin showing that the goods originated in Kenya;
- 2.  That the Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  by failing to hold  that  the  application  for  review  of  the  Respondent's decision  was  properly  made  by Shana  General  Stores  in  terms of  section 229  (1)  of  the  East  African  Community  Customs Management Act  and  since  the  Respondent  never  determined the  application  the  implication  and  section  229  (5)  of the  East African Community Customs Management Act should follow;
- 3.  That the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  holding that once  there  a duty remission scheme  granted  to  the manufacturer  the  incentive  of  free  duty  and  taxes  under  the East African Community Common External Tariff ceases;
- 4.  That the  Tax  revenue  appeals  tribunal  erred  in  law  in  holding that the Appellant was required to make thorough search if the goods  were  manufactured  using  materials  from  Kenya  while there was a certificate of origin issued by a competent authority showing that the goods originated from Kenya;
- 5.  That the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  by failing to  hold that the  respondent was required  under rule  12 (3),  13 (2) and (3) of the Rules of Origin to verify if the goods imported by the appellant were manufactured using materials obtained in Kenya instead of making a unilateral decision that the certificate of origin is invalid or ineffective;  and
- 6.  That the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law in  holding that  the  appellant  has  failed  to  discharge  its  burden under section  18 (3) (b) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, CAP. 408.

The appeal was argued  before us on 20.10.2021 during which, while Messrs.  Stephen  Axwesso,  Alan  Nlawi  Kileo  and  Wilson  Mukebezi,  learned advocates, joined forces to represent  the appellants, Ms. Consolatha Andrew,  learned  Principal  State  Attorney,  Mr.  Cherubin  Chuwa,  learned Senior  State  Attorney  and  Mr.  Thomas  Buki,  learned  State  Attorney,  like the learned advocates for appellant, joined forces to represent  the respondent. Both parties had  earlier  on filed written submissions  in support of their respective positions which they sought to adopt as part of their oral submissions.

At the oral  hearing, after adopting the written submissions in support of  the  appeal,  Mr.  Stephen  Axwesso,  amplified  on  some  matters  in  the written submissions.  He submitted that the Tribunal erred  in  upholding the decision  of the  Board that the goods imported  by the appellant were liable to  duties  and  taxes  in  terms  of  Article  25  (2)  of  the  Protocol  on  the Establishment  of  the  EAC  Customs  Union,  2004  (the  Protocol)  while  a certificate of origin  is in  place.  He submitted further that, once a certificate of origin  is  issued,  it  raises  a  rebuttable  presumption  that the  goods were produced  wholly  in  the  partner  state  by  using  materials  obtained  in  the partner state  or  produced  in  the  partner  state  by  using  materials  partially obtained  outside  the  partner  state.  He  added  that  the  presumption  can only be rebutted in exceptional circumstances and only through a verification  exercise conducted  in terms of rules  12  (2) and  13  (2) and  (3)

of the Rules of Origin,  2009.  He argued that the respondent cannot make a unilateral  decision  that  the  certificate  of  origin  is  invalid  and  that  it  is ineffective without  carrying out  the  verification exercise by  forming  a verification  committee  to  verify  its  correctness  or  otherwise.  The  learned counsel submitted further that it was wrong for the appellant to impose tax on the goods by merely looking at the Legal Notice.

Mr. Axwesso submitted further that the Tribunal also erred in  holding that  the  certificate  of origin  was  not  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that the imported goods were not manufactured  under the duty remission scheme. That,  the  Tribunal  was  wrong  in  ignoring  the  certificate  of  origin  and holding  that the  goods  were  manufactured  using  materials obtained  from outside the EAC under the duty remission scheme, without any evidence.

Submitting on the second ground of appeal,  Mr. Axwesso stated that the  Tribunal  erred  in  concurring  with  the  Board  that  SGS  who  was  the importer of the goods did not object or apply for review of the respondent's  decision  to  demand  import  duty. He  contended  that  the application  for review was properly made  by SGSL in terms of section  229 (1) of the EACCMA and that the decision of the respondent directly affected SGS who imported the goods.

Mr. Axwesso  added that the application for review was never determined  by the respondent and that,  in terms of section  229 (4) of the EACCMA,  the  respondent  was  mandatorily  required  to  communicate  its decision  within  thirty  (30)  days of the  lodging  of the  review.  Failure to do that,  under section 229 (4) of the EACCMA, the respondent was deemed to have accepted the review application thus meaning that the appellants had no tax liability,  he submitted.

On  the  third  ground,  Mr.  Axwesso  submitted  that the Tribunal  erred in holding  that  once  there  is  a duty  remission  scheme  granted  to  a manufacturer, the incentive of free duty and taxes under the EAC Common External Tariff ceases. He contended that goods which enjoy duty remission  scheme  are  those  manufactured  using  raw  material  imported from outside  partner states under the  remission  scheme;  that is,  imported without  paying  duty.  These  goods,  he  submitted,  are  meant  for  export outside  the  EAC  as  per  Article  25  of  the  Protocol  and  must  be  exported outside the EAC. The learned counsel, however, submitted that an innocent buyer  like  the  appellant  would  not  know  if the  goods  were  manufactured using  raw  materials  imported  from  outside  EAC  under the  duty  remission scheme. He contended that an answer to this would  be the production of

a  certificate  of  origin  or  a  scientific  examination  issued  by  a  competent authority,  in this case the KRA.

Mr.  Axwesso combined the fourth and fifth grounds of appeal  in their argument  in  support  of  the  appeal.  He  submitted  that  the  respondent never  questioned  the  validity  of the  certificate  of origin  and  differed  with the  finding  of  the  Tribunal  that  the  appellant  was  required  to  conduct  a search  to  validate  that the  goods  were  manufactured  using  raw  materials imported  from  outside  the  EAC  under  the  duty  remission  scheme.  That process would  not  be  relevant  in  the  presence  of the  certificate of origin, he  argued. He  contended  that  the  onus,  after  the  production  of  the certificate  of origin,  was  placed  by  law  on  the  respondent as  per  rules  12 (3),  1 3   (2) and (3) of the Rules of Origin.

On  the  last  ground of  appeal, Mr. Axwesso  submitted  that  the Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  holding  that  the  appellant  failed  to  discharge  her burden  under section  18 (2) (b) of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  because production of the certificate of origin  meant that the goods originated from a  particular  local  country  using  locally  sourced  materials  and  no  evidence was led by the respondent that the same was not genuine. In addition, Mr. Axwesso termed as irrational  and  arbitrary the decision  by the Tribunal  to the effect that the imported goods were produced from the goods shown in

the  Legal  Notice  because  the  mere  fact  that  the  manufacturer's  name appear  in  the  Legal Notice  is  not  enough  proof  that  the  goods  were manufactured using raw materials appearing in the Legal Notice.

Given the above submissions, the learned counsel implored the Court to allow the appeal with costs.

Responding  Ms.  Andrew submitted on the first ground of appeal that the respondent did  not at all  doubt the certificate of origin.  She contended however, that the certificate of origin meant  that the goods were manufactured  in  Kenya  but  that  it  did  not  show  that  the  same  were  not manufactured  using  raw  materials  appearing  in  the  Legal  Notice.  As  per Article 25 (2) of  the Protocol, Ms. Andrew  argued,  the  goods  were supposed  to  be  exported  outside  the  EAC,  short  of  which,  if  imported within,  they were to  be  charged  import duty. The  learned  counsel  quoted the  legal  notice  appearing  at  p .  30  of the  record  of appeal  which  shows, inter alia, that the finished  goods benefiting from the duty remission shall primarily  be  for  export outside  EAC and  that in  the event they are  sold  in the  customs  union,  they  shall  attract  duties, levies  and  other  charges provided  by  the  EAC  Common  External  Tariff.  She  added  that  allowing importation of such goods in any of the partner states without adhering to the conditions stipulated  under Article 25  (3) of the Protocol will defeat the

whole  purpose  of  promoting  such  goods  for  export  outside  the EAC provided for under Article 25 (1) of the Protocol.

With  regard  to  the  second  ground  of  appeal,  a  complaint  that  the application  for  review  of the  respondent's  decision  was  properly  made  by Shana General  Stores in terms of section  229 (1) of the  EACCMA and that since  the  respondent  never  determined  the  application,  under  subsection (4)  of  the  same  section,  the  imported  goods  were  free  from  any  import duty. The  learned  Principal  State Attorney submitted  that the complaint is one of facts,  not one of law, which should  not be entertained  by the Court as  per  section  25  (2)  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Act.  Alternatively,  the learned  counsel  submitted  that the Tribunal  was correct to  hold  that SGS and  SGSL  were  different  entities. She  thus  contended  that  no  proper application for review was lodged by the appellant.

The  third  ground  of  appeal,  a  complaint  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in holding that once there is a duty remission scheme  granted to a manufacturer, the incentive of free duty and taxes under the EAC Common External Tariff ceases, Ms. Andrew submitted, has been responded to when arguing  the  first  ground.  She  contended  that,  for  the  reasons  stated,  the Tribunal did  not err to so hold.

On  the  fourth  ground  of  appeal,  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  holding that the appellant ought to have made a search if the goods imported were not manufactured using the raw materials  which benefitted the  duty remission scheme, she submitted that if the Council of Ministers was made aware that the goods to be manufactured would be for consumption within the  EAC,  perhaps  it  would  not  have  granted  the  remission.  The  appellant was thus  under the  duty to  prove that the  goods were  not  manufactured using  the  materials  under  the  duty  remission  scheme;  the  certificate  of origin presented was not sufficient to prove that, she submitted.

The complaint in the fifth ground of appeal  is that the Tribunal erred in   not holding that it was incumbent upon the respondent to verify that the goods  imported  by  the  appellant  were  manufactured  using  raw  materials under the duty  remission  scheme  before  making  a  unilateral  decision  that the  certificate  of  origin  was  invalid.  Ms.  Andrew  submitted  that,  the  fact that  goods  met the  origin  criteria  does  not  make  them  qualify  for  export within  the  EAC  Customs  Union;  the  certificate  of  origin  was  relevant  for purposes other than that.

With regard to the last ground,  Mr. Thomas Buki, gave Ms. Andrew a helping  hand  and  submitted  that  the  Tribunal  was  right  to  hold  that  the appellant did not discharge her duty to prove the case under the provisions

of section  18 (2) (b) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act.  He submitted further that the  appellant was  required  to  prove  that  she  did  not  enjoy  the  duty remission  scheme  on  the  raw  materials  used  to  manufacture  the  goods under  discussion  and  that  is  when,  as  per Insignia  Limited  v.  The Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal No.  14  of  2007  (unreported),  evidential  burden  would  be  shifted  to  the respondents.  He added that the section imposes the burden of proof in tax matters  upon  an  appellant.  The  appellant failed  to  discharge that  burden, he argued.

Having  submitted  as  above,  the  learned Principal State  Attorney submitted  that  the  appeal  was  without  merit  and  implored  upon  us  to dismiss it with costs.

In  a  short  rejoinder,  Mr.  Axwesso  conceded  that  the  Legal  Notice showed  that  the  appellant  was  granted  a  permit  to  import  liquid  glucose under the duty remission scheme but submitted that the raw material was not used to manufacture goods imported to Tanzania under discussion.  He reiterated that the correctness of the certificate of origin should  have been verified  by the  respondent through  KRA.  He added  that the duty to verify that the  goods  under discussion  were  produced  using  raw  material  under the duty remission scheme was the respondent's, not the appellant's.

Having  heard the arguments by the parties, we retreated to compose the judgment. However, because of the confusions narrated above, especially the  fact that the  notice of appeal  showed  that it was only SGSL who  lodged  the  notice  of  appeal  to  register  her  dissatisfaction  with  the judgment of the Tribunal, we found difficulties in going on to compose the judgment  without  reopening  the  proceedings  with  a  view  to  hearing  the parties  to  the  appeal  the  effect  of this  ailment  on  the  appeal. We thus summoned  the  parties  and  reopened  the  proceedings  on  01.11.2021.  To the  learned  counsel  for the  parties,  we  posed  the  question:  what was the effect on the appeal in view of the fact that SGS did not lodge any notice of appeal to the Court.

Mr.  Stephen  Axwesso,  the  learned  counsel  who  appeared  for  the appellant, admitted that, indeed, SGS did  not lodge any notice of appeal to the Court  and that the ailment  was  caused by the  Tribunal whose proceedings,  judgment  and  decree  referred  to  only  SGSL  as  the  only appellant. He contended that the appellants are not to blame as the notice of intention  to appeal  to the Tribunal  appearing  at p.  151  of the  record of appeal  comprised  the  two  appellants. Likewise,  the  statement  of appeal appearing at p.  153 of the record of appeal, showed two appellants. Given the ailment, the learned counsel  prayed that the record  be  remitted to the

Tribunal  so  that  the  appeal  is  considered  in  respect  of  both  appellants. Alternatively,  he prayed that the appeal  before  us be considered in  respect of SGSL only who filed a notice of appeal.

On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Cherubin  Chuwa,  the  learned  Senior  State attorney who appeared for the respondent, submitted that the appellant in the  appeal  before  us  is  only  SGSL  who  lodged  the  notice  of  appeal.  As there was no notice of appeal  by SGS, there was no appeal  in  his respect, he  argued.  The  appeal  should  therefore  be  considered  in  respect of SGSL only, he contended. The learned Senior State Attorney strenuously objected  to  the proposal by  Mr. Axwesso  that  the  matter  should be remitted to the Tribunal to consider the appeal in the inclusive manner.

In  a   short rejoinder,  Mr.  Axwesso submitted that the confusion was a result of an  oversight and  should  not  be  used  to  punish  the  taxpayer.  He thus reiterated his prayers made above.

We should  state  at the outset that we  agree  with  Mr.  Axwesso  and Mr.  Chuwa  that  SGS  did  not  lodge  a  notice  of  appeal  in  terms  of  the mandatory provisions of rule 83 (1) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules. Given that failure to  lodge a  notice of appeal,  the  memorandum  of appeal she jointly filed  with  SGSL lacks  legs on  which to stand. The appeal  in  her respect is therefore incompetent and struck out.

There thus remains an  appeal  in  respect of SGSL only.  We now turn to  confront  the  grounds  of appeal  in  respect  of this  remaining  appellant. In  so  doing,  we  find  it  appropriate  to  start  with  the  second  ground  of appeal which is a complaint that the Tribunal erred in  law by failing to hold that  the  application  for  review  of the  respondent's  decision  was  properly made by the appellant in terms of section 229 (1) of the EACCMA and that since  the  respondent  never  determined  the  application  the  implication under section 229 (5) was that the respondent was not required to impose the  import  duty  complained  of.  The  issue  that  arise  from  this  ground  of appeal  is two-fold. That is, whether the appellant rightly complained to the respondent and whether  the respondent's failure to respond to the application  for  review,  meant  that  the  goods  were  not  subject  to  import duty as complained of.

We have stated  at the  beginning  of this judgment that the  importer of the  goods  was SGS. She  used  the  appellant's TIN.  The  application  for review  lodged  with  the  respondent  appears  at  p.  113  of  the  record  of appeal. It was written by SGS on headed paper of SGSL.  As already stated above, it was SGSL who lodged an appeal to the Board against the decision of  the  respondent  imposing  import  duty  on  the  goods.  SGS  was  joined later.  The  Tribunal  upheld  the  decision  of the  Board  in  holding  that  SGS

and  SGSL  were  different  entities. Having  so  held,  we  do  not  think  the Tribunal  should  have  proceeded  to  determine  an  appeal  by  SGS  who  did not  at  all  complain  against  the  imposition  of import duty.  Neither did  she lodge  an  application  for  review  with  the  respondent.  She  just joined  the proceedings  through  the  amended  statement  of  appeal.  As  SGS  neither complained  against  the  imposition  of  tax  nor  lodged  an  application  for review,  she,  being  a  separate  legal  entity  from  SGSL,  had  no  cause  of action  against the  respondent.  Likewise,  the appellant;  SGSL,  was  not the consignee of the goods. She was not the importer. She was thus a stranger to the transaction  between Candy Kenya Ltd, the supplier of the goods and SGS,  the  consignee  and  importer of the  goods.  The  provisions  of section 229 (1) of the EACCMA provide in no uncertain terms that:

"A person directly affected  by the decision or omission  of the  Commissioner or any other officer on  matters relating to  Customs shall  within  thirty days of the date of the decision  or omission lodge an application for review of that  decision or omission."

What we discern from the above provision is that it is a person who is directly affected by the decision of the Commissioner or his officers who has the  right to file a  revision.  In  the case at  hand,  SGS was the  importer of the  goods and,  in  our view,  is the  one  who  was directly affected by

the  decision  of  the  Commissioner  to  impose  import  duty.  However,  the application for review was made by SGSL. That,  in our view, was improper and  the  application  was  incompetent  before  the  eyes  of  the  law.  The Tribunal thus  rightly decided  that the  respondent was in the  right track to impose the import duty against the importer; SGS.

With  regard to the  respondent's failure to  respond to the  review, we agree with the respondent that as the review was applied by a  person who was  not  directly  affected  by  the  decision  to  impose  import  duty  on  the goods  under  discussion, the respondent  was  justified to ignore  that application.

The  net  effect  of  the  above  discussion  is  that  the  appellant,  given that  she  was  not  the  consignee  and  importer  of  the  goods,  she  is  a different  entity  from  the  consignee  and  importer  of the  goods;  SGS.  The appellant  thus  had  no locus standi in  the  dispute  between  SGS  and  the respondent from the outset. The Tribunal,  therefore,  rightly dismissed the appeal against her.

The  above  said  and  done,  we  find  the  above  discussion  disposes of the appeal.  In the  premises,  we do  not find  any dire  need to consider and determine  the  rest  of  the  grounds  of  appeal.  Their  consideration  and determination, in our view, will not serve any useful purpose.

The  sum  total  of the  above  is  that  the  respondent  was justified  to impose import duty on the goods under discussion and the Tribunal  rightly so found. Consequently, we find no merit is this appeal and dismiss it with costs.
