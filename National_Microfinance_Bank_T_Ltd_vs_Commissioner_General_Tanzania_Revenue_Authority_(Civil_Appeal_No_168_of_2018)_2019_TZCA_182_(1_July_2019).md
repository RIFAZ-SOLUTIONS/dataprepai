## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

agreement  with  a  foreign  company,  namely,  Neptune  Software  PLC  of Carolyin  House,  22 -  26  Dingwall  Road, Croydon, surrey,  United  Kingdom. In the agreement which was titled "Software Licence Agreement" (the SLA), the Foreign Company (the licensor) and the appellant (the licensee), respectively,  agreed  to  supply  and  obtain  the  use  of  a  modern  banking software under the agreed terms and conditions contained in the SLA.  The provisions  relating  to  payments  were  spelt  out  in  the  SLA  -   extension agreement which was dated the  13t h  day of April,  2006. According to  it, the licensee agreed to pay the licensor investment costs amounting to USD 165,117.00  on  signing  of  the  extension agreement. Thereafter, the licensee agreed to pay the licensor a  lumpsum annual  licence fee equal to USD  29,716.20. There  is  little  doubt that the  prescribed  payments were made by the licensee to the licensor in consideration of the SLA.

In the  year  2009,  through  its  large  taxpayer's  department,  the respondent conducted an audit of the appellant's affairs covering corporate tax withholding tax, VAT, employment taxes and stamp duty for the period from 2004  to 2007. Consequently, on  the 12t h October, 2009  the respondent  issued  a  preliminary  audit findings  report  which  stated, inter alia, that the appellant made several payments to non-resident persons for

licence  fees  in  respect  of software  and  related  IT services  for  which  she (appellant) was obliged to deduct the appropriate non-resident withholding tax rate as required by section 83 (1) (b) of the Income Tax Act, 2004 (the ITA, 2004).

Upon  receipt  of  the  preliminary  audit  report,  on  the  13t h   October, 2009 the appellant wrote the respondent disputing the claim that payments for the acquired software and  related services were subject to withholding tax. On  the  22n d   December,  2009  a  meeting  was  held  between  the representatives  of  both  parties  in  which  the  disputed  audit  report  was featured. In the final  event,  on the  1 s t  June,  2010 the  respondent issued to  the  appellant a  withholding  tax certificate  showing  that the  appellant's tax  liability was to the tune of Tshs.  680,042,401/=  which was comprised of Tshs.  411,876,562/=  being  the  principal  tax  and  Tshs.  268,165,839/= being interest on the principal tax.

Dissatisfied,  the  appellant  lodged  a  statement of appeal  in  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  Board)  which  instituted  the  Income  Tax Appeal case No. 32 of 2010.  At the hearing before the Board, the thrust of the  appellant's  argument was that the  payments  she  made  in  relation  to the  software  do  not  represent  a  royalty  and,  thus,  the  same  were  not

subject to withholding tax.  A further argument was taken to the effect that the appellant's  payments  in  relation  to  IT services were  not a  service fee subject  to  withholding  tax,  the  more  so  as  the  services  were  performed outside Tanzania.

On the other hand,  it was the contention of the respondent that the right granted  by the  licensor to the appellant for the  use  of the software was  a  temporary  one  and,  thereby,  the  payments  made  to  acquire  it constituted a  royalty within the meaning of the term as defined by section 3  of the ITA,  2004. As regards the IT support and  maintenance services, the respondent  countered  that  the  same  were  not  entirely  rendered outside Tanzania and, hence, they were subject to withholding tax.

Upon its deliberations, the Board made a  unanimous finding that the lumpsum payment made by the appellants to the licensor did not constitute a  royalty and,  as  such,  the same was  not subject to withholding tax. On the issue as to whether or not the payment in relation to IT services were subject to withholding  tax,  the  Board,  again,  unanimously found  that the services  were  not  performed  in  Tanzania  be  it  wholly  or  partly  and,  as such,  the  payment could  not attract withholding tax. In  the  upshot,  in  a judgment that was handed down on the 17t h  February, 2011 the appellants appeal  was  allowed  with  an  order  that  each  party  should  bear  her  own costs.

The  respondent  was  discontented,  whereupon  she  instituted an Income Tax Appeal  No.  7  of  2011  in  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal (the Tribunal).  At the Tribunal, the respondent herein (the appellant there) lodged two grounds of appeal, namely that:-

"(a) the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board erred in law and in fact by holding that the lumpsum payment made by the Respondent (licensee) to the licensor is not a royalty under section 83 (1) of the Income Tax A c t 2004  and  is,  therefore,  not  subject  to withholding tax; and

- (b) the  Tax Revenue Appeals Board erred in law and in fact by holding that the service fees paid by the Respondent relating to the installation,  testing and maintenance of the supplied software are not subject to withholding tax ."

At  the  height  of  its  deliberations,  the  Tribunal  took  the  following position

- "...it is the Tribunal's  respectful view  that  the Agreement between  the Respondent and Neptune Software  PLC  was  a  lease  agreement;  that  the payment made pursuant thereto was a royalty; that the  services  rendered  to  the  Respondent  by  the suppliers irrespective of their location were performed on  an  asset in  Tanzania  and  that  the said  payment have a source in Tanzania ."

Consequently,  the  tribunal  allowed  the  respondent's  appeal  and,  in fine, the decision of the Board was overturned.

Dissatisfied,  the  appellant presently seeks to  impugn the decision  of the  Tribunal  upon  a  memorandum  of appeal  which  is  comprised  of four points of grievance, namely:-

- "(i) That the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law when it held that the Agreement between the

Appellant and Neptune Software PLC was a lease agreement;

- (ii) That the Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law  and fact  when  it  held  that payment  made pursuant  to the Agreement between the Appellant and Neptune Software PLC was a royalty;
- (Hi) That the Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in law in  holding that payments for services performed  outside Tanzania  in  relation to the software  agreement  between  the  Appellant  and Neptune Software  PLC are  payments  which  are sourced from  Tanzania  irrespective  of the  place where the services were performed; and
- (iv) That the  Tax Appeals  Tribunal erred in upholding the  respondent's  appeal  and  setting  aside  the judgment of  the Tax Revenue Appeals Board."

When the appeal was placed before us for hearing, the appellant was represented  by  Dr.  Kibuta  Ong'wamuhana  and  Mr.  Wilson  Mukebezi,  both learned Advocates, whereas the respondent had the services of Mrs. Joyce Sojo, also learned Advocate.

Dr.  Kibuta  who took the floor to argue the appeal, fully adopted the appellant's  written  submissions  as  well  as  the  memorandum  of  appeal which  he  highlighted  in  his  oral  submissions. From  the  memorandum  of appeal,  Dr.  Kibuta  formulated  three  issues  for  our  determination; first, whether  or  not  the  Tribunal  correctly  held  that  the  agreement  between Neptune  and  the  appellant  was  a  lease; second, whether  or  not  the payment  in  consideration  of  the  agreement  was  a royalty  subject  to withholding  tax;  and third, whether or  not the  service  fees  paid  by  the appellant are subject to withholding tax.

To  begin  with,  Dr.  Kibuta  submitted  that  the  first  two  issues  are intertwined  and  he,  thus,  proposed  to advance a  single argument in their support. In that regard, it was  his respectful contention that  the agreement between the appellant and  Neptune did  not constitute a  lease. The  terms  of the  agreement,  he  said,  are  categorically  clear  in  that  the same was a  purchase  agreement. The  learned  counsel  for the  appellant contended that the  recitals in the agreement clearly state the intention of the parties being to purchase/acquire the software from  Neptune which

words  leave  no  speculation  that the transaction  was  not  a  lease. In  her written  submissions,  the  appellant  contended  that  a lease  evisages  a cenario  where  a  person  uses  an  asset  belonging  to  another  person  or  a licence  to  use  it  temporarily. On  the  contrary,  she  further  submitted, clause  29  of the  SLA  makes  provision  to  the  effect  that  " the agreement shall continue  until terminated in  accordance  with  the provisions of the agreement". To  that  extent,  she  concluded,  there  was  continuity  and permanence in the terms of the agreement.  The appellant's payments, she added, represented the purchase price of the software which is a copyrighted article and, for that matter, such payments did not constitute a royalty.

To bolster her submissions, in this regard, the appellant referred the Court to  several  Indian  decision  which  are  apparently  unreported  - viz Civil  Appeal  No.  2582  of  1998  Tata  Consultancy  Services  vs  The State of Andra  Pradesh;  Motorola  Inc.  Ersson  Radio vs  Deputy C. I. T;  Velankani  Mauritius Ltd  vs  Assessee; and M/s  Infrasoft Limited India Branch vs Assistant Director of Income Tax.

As regards the third issue,  Dr.  Kibuta submitted that the services fee paid  by  the  appellant  to  non-residents  for  services  performed  outside

Tanzania  has  no source in Tanzania  hence  not subject to withholding tax. The dispute  in  point,  he  said,  is  not  new. In  the  unreported  Civil  Appeal No. 146  of  2015  Commissioner  General  (TRA)  vs  Pan  African Energy (T) Ltd the Court made the following observation:-

"The appellant (TRA) agrees that he services were not rendered in Tanzania but says the services were rendered  in  connection  to  samples  drilled  from Tanzania and payment made in  Tanzania. That is actually  what took place  but,  with  respect to  the learned advocates for the appellant-f we do not think that they have grasped the real meaning of  section 69 (0  0)  of the Income  Tax Act. The section  is dear that income tax is chargeable for service fee received for services rendered in Tanzania. What is stressed in the section is that the services must be rendered in Tanzania ."

In the upshot, the Court concluded that the payment for the services were not chargeable to withholding tax. Dr.  Kibuta  was  of the firm  view

that the  decision  in  the Pan African  Energy case  (supra)  was  a  correct exposition  of  the  law. He  was  aware,  however,  that  the  Court  decided differently in the unreported  Civil Appeal No. 24  of  2018  Tullow Tanzania  BV vs The  Commissioner  General  (TRA). In  her  written submissions,  the  appellant firmly  contends  that  the Tullow case  (supra) was erroneously decided and, accordingly, she invited  us to depart from it and,  in  lieu  thereof,  we  should  uphold  the Pan  African  Energy (supra) decision.  In sum, Dr. Kibuta urged us to allow the appeal with costs.

In  reply,  Mrs.  Sojo,  similarly,  fully  adopted  the  respondent's  written submission  which  were,  incidentally,  of  her  own  making. To  resist  the appeal, the learned counsel for the respondent commenced her submissions  with  the  contention  that the  appellant  did  not  purchase  the software from  Neptune but,  rather, she made payments to secure the use of the same.  To that extent,  Mrs. Sojo reaffirmed the Tribunal's finding to the effect that the transaction between  the appellant and Neptune constituted a lease agreement and that the payments made in consideration thereof was a royalty to which withholding tax is chargeable.

To  buttress  her  contention,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent sought to cull from the  preamble of the SLA itself. It is  provided therein, she said,  that "the licensee is desirous of acquiring and being licensed to use an  integrated software... "and  that  the licensee has agreed to buy from the licensor the right to use the software..." Additionally, she further submitted, the agreement is titled "SOFTWARE LICENCE AGREEMENT" to depict its true nature as a mere licence to use the licensor's software as distinguished  from  a purchase  agreement. To  that  end,  the  learned counsel  for  the  respondent  reiterated  her  contention  that the  transaction between the appellant and  Neptune was a  lease just as  her  payments  in consideration thereof constituted a royalty.

As  regards  the  service  fee, Mrs. Sojo painstakingly  faulted  the appellant  for  repeatedly  insisting  that  they  did  not  withhold  tax  because the  services  at  issue  were " performed ' outside the  United  Republic. The learned counsel for the respondent took strong exception to the appellant's use of  the word "performed" since performance, as such, is not  a determinant factor.  She referred to section 69 (i) (i) of the ITA 2004 which provides:-

- (i) Payment including service fee of any type not mentioned in paragraph (g) or (h) or attributable to employment exercised,  service  rendered or forbearance  from  exercising employment or rendering services-
- (ii) In the United Republic regardless of  place of  payment; or..."

Mrs. Sojo  then submitted that  the catch words  are: "Services rendered' as  distinguished  from "services performed'. Drawing from the foregoing, in her written submissions the learned counsel for the respondent concluded thus:-

"We strongly reiterate and insist that the question of whether the services  were performed inside  or outside  Tanzania is completely immaterial when in consideration (sic) of its taxability through withholding taxand the only criteria to look into, is to see if  the said  services were rendered meaning if were delivered or transmitted in  Tanzania and that was precisely the intention of  the legislature."

In  sum,  the  learned counsel  for the  respondent urged  us to dismiss the appeal with costs.

Having heard the learned rival submissions, we agree with  Dr.  Kibuta that this appeal involves three issues worth our consideration and determination.  The learned counsel for the appellant consolidated the first two  issues  and,  in  our  determination,  we  propose  to  do  the  same. In determining the first two issues we deem it instructive, as a starting point, to  be  clear  of the  terms "lease" and  "royalty" as  used  in  the  ITA,  2004. Under section 3 of the ITA, 2004 the term lease is defined to mean:-

"an  arrangement providing a person  with a  temporary right  in  respect of an  asset of another person,  other than money, and includes a licence, profit -a  - prendre, option, rental agreement, royalty agreement and tenancy."

Under the same provision the term royalty is defined to mean:-

' Royalty" means any payment made by the lessee  under a  lease of an intangible asset and includes  payments for -

- a) the  use  of,  or the right to  use,  a  copyrightpatent\  design,  mode, plan, secret formula or  process or trademark;
- b) the supply of know-how including information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific equipment or experience;
- c) the use of,  or right to use, a cinematography film,  videotape, sound recording or any other like medium;
- d) the  use  of, or  right  to  use, industrial, commercial  or  scientific equipment;
- e) the  supply  of  assistance  ancillary  to a matter  referred  to  in paragraphs (a) to (d); or
- f) a total or partial forbearance with respect to a matter referred to in paragraphs (a) to (e)."

We think it is also pertinent for us to just as well  reproduce sections 6  (1)  (b),  69  (i)  (i)  and  83  (1)  (b) of the ITA 2004. For a start, section  6 (1) (b) stipulates:-

"6  (1)  Subject  to  the provisions  of subsection  (2),  the chargeable income of  a person for a year of  income from any employment, business or investment shall be:-

(a) ........ N/A

- (b) In the case of  a non-resident  person, the persons income from the employment'  business or investment for the year of  the income, but only to the extent that the income has a source in the United Republic."

For its part, section 69 (i) (i) goes as follows:-

"69. The following payments have a source in the United Republic:-

- (a) ................ N/A
- (b) ................ N/A
- (c) ................

N/A

- (d) ................

N/A

- (e) ................ N/A
- (f) ................ N/A
- (9) ................ N/A
- (h) ................ N/A
- (i) Payments, including service fees, of  a type not mentioned in paragraphs (g)  or (h)  or attributable  to  employment

exercised, services rendered or for bearance from exercising employment or rendering service-

- (i) in  the  United Republic,  regardless  of the place  of payment; or..."

And, section 83 (1) (b) provides thus:-

"83 (1) Subject to subsection (2) a resident  person who-

- (a) ................ N/A
- (b) Pays a service fee or an insurance premium with a source in  the  United  Republic  to  a  non-resident person  shall withhold  income  tax  from  the  payment  at  the  rate provided for in paragraph 4 (c) of  the First  Schedule."

In  our consideration  and determination of the issues involved  in this appeal, we  shall throughout have in mind the foregoing extracted provisions.

As we  have already intimated, the first two  issues seek to fault the Tribunal for holding that the agreement  between Neptune  and  the appellant  was  a  lease  and  that  the  same  constituted  a  royalty. In  our

endeavour to resolve the issue of contention, we take the position that, of all the terms of the SLA, the most telling is the one comprised in article 2.0 which went thus:-

## "2.0 License

- 2.1 The  licensor  hereby  licenses, grants  and authorizes  the  licensee  at  all  times  during  the continuance  of  this  licence  and  so  long  as  the software  continues  to  exist  and  function  to  the satisfaction of  the licensee and\ subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter appearing, a non­ exclusive  and  non-transferrable  right  to  use  the following software for its internal use only:-

Description  of software:  Those  elements  of the  Equinox solution as defined in Schedule One hereto."

For  her  part  the  appellant  (licensee)  acknowledged  as  follows  in article 2.2:-

"2.2  The  licensee  hereby  accepts  to  be  licensed under the terms and conditions set forth herein the right to use on a non-exclusive and nontransferrable basis the software for its own internal use only ."

To  us,  it  is  clearly  discernible  from  the  foregoing  article  of the  SLA that  what  was  transferred  to  the  appellants  is  only  a  licence  to  use  the software  which  was  to  be  supplied  by  Neptune  under  certain  terms  and conditions.  To that extent, on a proper construction, we do not entertain a flicker of doubt that the SLA constituted a lease within the definition of the term under section 3 of the ITA,  2004. Likewise, we are just as well fully satisfied  that the  payment of the  licence fees was a  consideration for the right  to  use  software  which  is  within  the  definition  of  a  "royalty"  under clause (a) of its definition under section 3 of the ITA, 2004.

Thus,  all  said, with  respect to the first two issues,  we find ourselves unable to accede to the appellant's contention  that the SLA constituted  a purchase agreement and  not a  lease just as we do  not accept her further contention that the payments in consideration thereof did  not constitute a

royalty. We, accordingly,  uphold the decision of the Tribunal with  respect to the nature of the SLA.

Coming to the third  issue, the point of contention  is, whether or not the  service fees paid by  the  appellant  to Neptune  were  subject  to withholding  tax. As we  have already intimated, the  appellant thinks  not, her argument being that since the service were not performed in Tanzania as  required  by  section  69  (i)  (i),  then  the  payment  had  no  source  in Tanzania  and,  therefore,  withholding  tax  is  not chargeable. As we  have, again, also intimated, from the adversary's end, the respondent faulted the appellant  for  using  the  word  "performed"  with  respect  to  the  services rendered and,  in the  upshot,  she submitted that he question whether the services were rendered inside or outside Tanzania is completely immaterial.

On  our  part, we  entirely  subscribed  to  what  the  Court  set  as conditionalities  of  subjecting  payments  to  withholding  tax  in  the  case  of Tullow (supra) wherein the Court observed

'' Reading sections 6 (1), 69 (i) (i) and 83 (1) (b), all together gives two conditions a payment to a non­ resident to be subjected to withholding tax. These

are: (1) the services of which the payment is made must  be rendered  in the United  Republic of Tanzaniaand  (2)  the  payment  should  have  a source in the United  Republic of Tanzania."

Further down in its judgment, the Court also observed

"It is our strong view that the word rendered used under section  69  (i)  (i)  is  synonymous  to  words "supplied" or " devivered" In  this  regard a  non­ resident  who provides services  to  a  resident)   has delivered/supplied  services  to  a  resident  of  the United Republic of Tanzania. The recipient of the service  is actually  the payer for such  services,  in which  case, "source  of payment" cannot be  any other place  except  where  the  payer resides. In other words, as the services of which the payments were  made, were  consumed  or  utilized  by  the appellant in the United Republic of Tanzania for the purposes of earning income in the United Republic,

then payments made for such services had a source in the United  Republic of Tanzania and  the respondent had to withhold tax under section 83 (1) (c) of  the A ct"

In  arriving  at the foregoing  conclusion, their lordships were well  aware of the Pan African Energy case (supra) but distinguished it in the following words

"While the indian Act talks of  the source of  income, on the other hand section 69 (i) (i) talks of  source of payment The  case  of  Pan  African  Energy (supra) is  therefore  distinguishable  as it relied on the  interpretation  of section  9  (1)  (vii)  (c)  of the Indian Income  Tax Act to arrive at its finding that the  said provision,  as  it  was,  was  in  parimateria with section 69 (i) (i) of  the A ct "

We  just as well subscribe to the reasoning of the Court in distinguishing  from  it  the  case  of Pan  African  Energy (supra). That being the position, we find no cause to embrace the appellants invitation to

us  to  depart  from  the  decision  in Tullow. We  note  that,  of  recent,  a corresponding  stance  was  adopted  by  the  Court  in  the  unreported  Civil Appeal No. 123 of 2018  Shell Deep  Water  Tanzania BV. V. Commissioner General (TRA).

In  view  of  the  aforesaid,  we  similarly  uphold  the  decision  of  the Tribunal with respect to the service fees and, in the final event, we find the appeal to be bereft of merits and we, accordingly, dismiss it with costs.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 25t h  day of June, 2019.
