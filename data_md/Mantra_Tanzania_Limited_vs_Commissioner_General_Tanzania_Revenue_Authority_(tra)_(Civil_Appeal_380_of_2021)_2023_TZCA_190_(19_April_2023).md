## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

25t h  October, 2022 &amp; 1 9 A pril, 2023

## LILA. JA:

The  appellant  is  before  the  Court  disputing  the  liability  to  pay withholding tax imposed by the respondent under  Withholding Tax Certificate  No.  WHT/GST/02/12/14  of 4t h   December,  2014  for  the  years 2010-2012  (the  Certificate).  The  Certificate  required  the appellant to  pay TZS 157,194,288.00 as principal tax liability due and TZS 100,000.00 being interest  thereon  making  a  total  of  TZS  257,195,034.00.  The  efforts  to

challenge  it  before  both  the  Tax Appeals  Board  (the  TRAB)  and  the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the TRAT) bore no success.

The principal business of  the appellant included exploration of minerals in  Tanzania  and  in  the  year  2008  it  was  licensed  to  conduct  uranium exploration in areas of southern Selous Game Reserve. On the other hand, Tanganyika  Wildlife  Safaris  (TWSL)  was  licensed  to  carry  out  hunting activities  in  Hunting  Blocks  LU7,  LU8  and  MB1  whereas  Game  Frontiers Limited (GF) was licensed to carry out hunting activities in the Mbaran'gandu Wildlife Management Area.

The parties are not at issue that the respondent conducted a tax audit on the appellant for the years 2010 to 2012 which revealed that the appellant had effected payments to TWSL and GF (henceforth the hunting companies) of USD 150,000 annually for which the respondent was of the view that the appellant had an obligation under the law to deduct tax at the appropriate non-residential withholding tax rate in accordance with the requirement of section  83(l)(b)  of  the  Income  Tax  Act  (the  ITA)  but  failed  to  do  so. Similarly, the appellant does not dispute making such payments. Pursuant to

that,  the  respondent  issued  the  aforesaid  Certificate  which  the  appellant disputed its validity.

The dispute culminated into the appellant instituting an appeal to the TRAB contending that the payments made were not in the nature of rent but rather a  compensation for business disruptions which emanated from access agreements  entered  between  the  appellant  and  the  hunting  companies termed as Strategic Alliance Agreements (the SAAs). The appellant claimed that the agreements were aimed at ensuring a smooth co-existence on the land during the performance of their respective activities which overlapped in the Hunting Blocks LU7, LU8 and MB1 for TWSL and in the Mbaran'gandu Wildlife Management Area for the GF. In reply, the respondent maintained that by virtue of the SAAs, the compensation paid to the hunting companies by  the  appellant  constituted rental payments  hence  were  subject  to withholding tax under the provisions of section 82 of the ITA.

So as to set the roadmap in the determination of the dispute, the TRAB framed the following issues: -

- 1.  Whether payments made by the appellant to the hunting companies amount to rent.

- 2.  Whether the respondent has included in its tax demand the amount of USD. 6,430 of withholding tax already paid by the appellant.
- 3.  Whether the appellant is liable to pay any withholding tax based on the above
- 4.  To what reliefs are the parties entitled.

Hearing  of the  appeal  before  the  TRAB  proceeded  by  way  of written submissions and the appellant tendered four documentary exhibits; the Tax computation  prepared  by the  respondent (exhibit Al),  SAAs  (exhibit A2), advance  payment document (exhibit A3)  and Withholding Tax Certificate (exhibit A4). The respondent did not tender any document as exhibit.

Relying on clause 9(b) of the SAAs, the definitions of the words rent and lease as provided in the ITA and section 88(l)(a) of the Land Act Cap.  113 R.E. 2002, sections 95(l)(b)(c) and 96(30 of the Mining Act,  1998, Dr. Abel Mwiburi, learned advocate, who represented the appellant, strongly submitted before  the  TRAB  that  the  payments  made  to  the  hunting companies by the appellant do not translate to rent but a compensation for loss of business on the part of the hunting companies on which the liability to withhold tax does not arise.  In response,  Ms. Achimpota, appearing for the respondent, stoutly submitted that looking at the meaning of the term SAAs and  bearing in  mind the distinct activities each of the  parties to the SAAs had  in the area,  the agreements do  not suggest that parties to the SAAs were going to share the resources. Instead, she contended, the SAAs were cleverly drafted to avoid tax. She, further, contended that compensation is founded on the extent of injury or loss as would be assessed at a particular time and cannot therefore be a fixed amount as was the case between the parties to the SAAs. She had no qualm with the definitions of the words rent and lease and the imports of the provisions of the sections cited  by  Dr.  Mwiburi  but  she  insisted  that  the  SAAs  do  not  qualify  as payments in the form of compensation but were arrangements to facilitate tax avoidance.  Referring to clause 6 of the SAAs,  Ms. Achimpota,  pressed that each of the parties to the SAAs enjoyed exclusive possession of the area and it was apparent that the hunting companies leased their piece of land to be used by the appellant for access to its exploration site thus qualifying to be a lease.

The  TRAB,  after  a  full  trial,  answered  the  first  three  issues  in  the affirmative  and  dismissed  the  appeal  by  the  appellant.  In  essence,  and particularly in respect of the first issue which is very relevant in this appeal,

the TRAB decided in favour of the respondent that the appellant was liable to pay the withholding tax in terms of section  82(l)(a) of the ITA on the rental income and interest thereon.

The appellant felt aggrieved by the TRAB decision and sought to challenge it by lodging a four-point statement of appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the  TRAT).  The  first  two  grounds  touched  on  whether  the payments made by the appellant to the hunting companies were compensation or rental charges and faulted the TRAT for treating it as rental charges and hence subject to payment of withholding tax. The  remaining two grounds related to,  respectively,  about whether there was  proof that USD 6,430 was already paid and whether interest was payable in respect of the alleged withholding tax liability.

The TRAT was called upon to reconsider and determine the appeal basing on  similar  arguments  which  were placed  before the TRAB.  It allowed the appeal in  respect of USD 6,430 which it held was already paid. As for the first two grounds, for similar reasons given by the TRAB, it concurred with the finding of  the TRAB that the payments effected to the hunting companies

by the appellant constituted rent for which withholding tax was payable. It held that:

"As  correctly  held  by  the  board, if  the  payments were  Intended to  be  compensation  and not for lease  as  alleged by  the appellant in the true meaning thereof,  they would not occur on specific amounts as indicated in the agreement in each year, rather  in  staggering  amounts  based  on  actual  or estimated assessment of the damages caused as ordinarily risks as damages cannot be expected to be at constant levels each year ."

In respect of payment of interest on the withholding tax liability, the TRAT held it to be consequential.

Still, the appellant was not satisfied, hence the instant appeal against the TRAT decision. There are two grounds of appeal which read as follows:

- '1 .   The Tax Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  grossly erred  in law by holding that the payment made by the appellant to hunting companies  constituted  rent  for  which  withholding  tax  is payable.
- 2.  The Tax Revenue Tribunal  grossly erred in law by holding that the appellant  is liable to  pay  interest."

At the hearing of the appeal, the parties reinforced their representations. The appellant had the services of Dr. Alex Mwiburi who also appeared  before  the  TRAB  and  TRAT  and  was  assisted  by  Ms.  Anitha Kimario. For the respondent, Ms. Consolata Andrew, learned Principal State Attorney  appeared  and  was  assisted  by  Mr.  Hospis  Maswanyia  and  M r. Harold Gugami, both learned Senior State Attorneys.

We propose to begin by stating that the scope of the Court's mandate in appeals emanating from the TRAT is limited by law. The Court is precluded from dealing with issues of facts and to do so is a violation of the provisions of section 25(2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act (the TRAA). We therefore endorse the legal  proposition as advanced  by the  respondent in the reply written  submission.  We  are  compelled  to  state  so  on  account  of  the submissions  lodged  in  Court  by  both  sides and  the  respective  arguments before us in  which, a substantial  part of them tend to  move the Court to reconsider  the  evidence  on  record  so  as  to  determine  the  appeal.  This, however, does not in any way mean that we do not appreciate the lucid and detailed submissions filed by the parties. The opposite is the truth. We do not intend to, again,  recite the parties' submissions in details but we shall refer to them in the course of this judgment where such need would arise.

The epicenter of the dispute or crucial issue to be answered in ground one (l) of this appeal  is whether the money paid  by the appellant to the hunting companies  constitutes rent  which is subject  to payment  of withholding tax or constituted compensation hence not subject to payment of withholding tax.  The parties' stand points have not changed all along as stated above. Bearing the above in mind, it becomes clear that resolution of the above stated issue is mostly dependent upon the legal  impressions of the SAAs terms and conditions. Of great significance and relevance here, as argued  by  the  parties  and  considered  by  the  TRAB  and  TRAT,  are  the definition of what is meant by a Strategic Alliance Agreement and clauses E and  6   of the SAAs. We shall also consider what is rent and compensation and the distinction thereof. Like both the TRAB and TRAT, for easy reference, we reproduce the contents of the afore listed documents as hereunder:

Definition of the SAAs is provided to be: -

"The Strategic  Alliance  Agreement ("Agreement") is  an arrangement  between two companies who  have agreed  to  share  resources  in  a  specific  project. A strategic alliance can be forged  for  sharing  products, distribution channels, manufacturing capability, project

## fundingcapita! equipment, knowledge, expertise or intellectual  property. "(Emphasis added)

Clause E of the SAAs provides: -

"The Hunting Company and the Mining Company have agreed to cooperate so that each company is able to undertake its respective  functions,  hunting  and  exploration  and  mining, respectively, to achieve its objectives in the property."

And, Clause 6 stipulates that: -

"The Mining Company shall have full and unrestricted access onto and within the property to conduct mineral exploration and  mining activities including but  not  limited  to  ground work, drilling,  airbone surveys,  mining and mineral processing and the Hunting Company shall ensure that its activities do not disrupt  or  in any way  impeded  the Mining Company's  activities on the property, provided that the Mining Company shall  give reasonable notice  to  the Hunting  Company of its intended activities."

We now consider the grounds of appeal beginning with ground one (1) of appeal. As demonstrated above, at the hearing of this matter before the TRAB,  TRAT and  before  us,  it  was  common  ground  that the  appellant's principal  business included exploration of minerals in Tanzania  and  in the year 2008 was licensed to conduct uranium exploration in areas of southern

Selous Game Reserve. Tanganyika Wildlife Safaris (TWSL) was licensed to carry out hunting activities in  Hunting  Blocks  LU7,  LU8 and  MB1  whereas Game Frontiers Limited (GF) was licensed to carry out hunting activities in the  Mbaran'gandu Wildlife  Management Area.  It was further  not disputed that the activities of the appellant and the hunting companies overlapped as was  explained  by  the  appellant.  Likewise,  the  appellant  did  not  dispute entering  into agreements with the hunting  companies, the SAAs.  It is the contents of the SAAs and the nature of payments made by the appellant to the  hunting  companies  which  are  now  at  issue  whether  they  paid  in  an arrangement  which  amounted  to  a  lease  and  therefore  the  payment amounted to rent from which a liability arose to the appellant to withhold tax.

We have given due consideration to both oral and written submissions of both sides. In view of the undisputed facts above, we think, so as to have a  smooth  landing  in  resolving  the  issues  before  us,  we should  start with expounding  the  essential  features  of  a lease. Lease  agreements  are regulated by specific legal  provisions. Section  2 of the  Land Act,  Cap.  113 provides for the  definition  of various  terminologies  relevant  in  leases.  In terms of it, lease includes a sub-lease whether registered or unregistered of

a right of occupancy and includes a short-term lease and an agreement to lease.  It also defines a  lessor or grantor to be a  person  by whom  lease is granted and a lessee/grantee or tenant as a person whom lease is granted. A licensee is defined as the person granting or giving the licence.  Equally important is the definition of licence which is defined thus:

licence"means a permission given by the Government or an occupier of  land under  a right  of  occupancy or  a lessee which allows the person to whom the licence is given to occupy or use or do some act in relation to the land comprised in the right of  occupancy or the lease which would otherwise be a trespass but does not  include an easement"

In  the  light  of  the  above  definitions,  by  being  granted  licence  to conduct the aforesaid  activities,  the appellant and the hunting companies became  licensees.  They were simply granted  permission  to  conduct their respective  activities  on  the  land  comprised  in  their  respective  areas  as defined in their respective licenses. They were not leased that land. For lease to exist, these essential features must be apparent in the permission given. One, the lessee or tenant must have exclusive possession for a fixed period or term certain in consideration of rent Tenga R.W. &amp; Mramba S.I. in their

book Conveyancing and Disposition of Land in Tanzania, Law and Procedure, Second Edition, pages 149 and 150 elaborate that:

"The tenant must have the right to exdude all other persons from the premises demised. A right to occupy certain premises for a fixed period cannot be tenancy if the person granting the right remains in general control of the property. In addition, if  no defined  premises are in question, there cannot  be a lease... "(Emphasis added)

Elaborating on the essence of the above element, Lord Templeman in Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809, quoted in the book Property Law: Cases and Materials, Sixth Edition by Roger J. Smith (henceforth Roger's Book), page 471 stated that: -

". . . The traditional view that the grant of  exclusive possession for a term at a rent creates a tenancy is consistent with the elevation  of a  tenancy into  an  estate  in  land.  The  tenant possessing exclusive possession is able to exercise the rights of  an owner of  land,  which is in the real  sense his land  albeit temporarily  and  subject to certain restrictions. A tenant  armed with exclusive  possession can keep out  strangers  and  keep out the landlord unless the landlord is exercising limited rights reserved to him by the tenancy agreement to enter and view and repair."

Two, the  duration  of the  lease  must  be  clear  in  that  it  should  be defined  or  specific.  The  rent,  commencement  and  period  of  the  lease (length) must be certain. An agreement for an uncertain term cannot be a tenancy. Insisting on  this requirement, Lord Neuberger  in Mexfield Housing Co-operative Ltd v Berrisford [2012]  1   AC  955  cited  in  the Roger's Book, page 466 had this to say: -

"It seems to have been established for a long time that an agreement  for  uncertain term cannot  be  a tenancy  in the  sense of  being a term of  years. In Say v Smith (1563) Plowd  269, 272, Anthony Brown J. said that 'every contract sufficient to make  a  lease  for years  ought  to  have  certainty  in  three li mitations, viz  in  the  commencement of the  term,  in  the continuance of  it, and  in the end  of  it... and  words  in the lease, which don't make this appear, are but  babble ' "

In  circumstances  where  the  duration  of the  lease  is  uncertain,  the agreement or transaction  is  not a  lease.  Lord  Denning  MR:  in Harvey v Pratt [1965] WLR 1026 Cited in  Roger's Book at page 463, when dealing with  an  argument that the agreement should  be  presumed to commence within time where the agreement has no commencement date, provided this guidance:

"The first  point  is this: the  document  does  not  specify  any  date from which the iease is to commence. It has been settled  law for  all  time that, in order to have a valid  agreement for lease, it  is essential that  it  should  appear, either  in express terms or by reference to some writing which would make it certain, or by reasonable inference from the language used, on what  day the term is to commence...

I think the answer to that argument, however persuasive, is that the taw is settled on  the point...  It is settled beyond question that, in order for there to be a valid agreement for l ease, the  essentials  are  not  only  for  the  parties  to  be determined, the property to be determined, the length of  the term and the rent, but also the date of its commencement. This document does not contain it. it is not sufficient to say you can supply  it  by  an implied term as to reasonable time"

With regard to obtaining consequences in the event term of the lease is uncertain, Davies L J, on the same page, made it clear that, in the case of an agreement for a lease, if the length of the term and the commencement of the term are not defined, then the subject of the agreement or contract is uncertain too.

Three, lease  must  be  created  in  the  proper  way. Formalities  or procedures for creating a  lease should  be complied with for it to be valid. These may include registration and others.

It seems clear to us, from the reading of the above authorities that, existence of  a lease is dependent  upon the  three  essentials being conjunctively satisfied.  Simply  stated,  for  a   lease  to  exist,  the  agreement must explicitly show that the land was granted for a specific duration (must have a commencement date, continuation and the date it will end), specific rent should be pronounced and the tenant must have exclusive possession of the  land  during the tenancy period.  Writing on  leases and  licences and providing  the  distinction  between  lease  and  licence,  Kate  Green  &amp;  Joe Cursley in  the  book titled; Land  Law, Fifth  Edition  at  page  53  have the following to say: -

" Normally,if  a  person occupying another's  land  does not  have exclusive  possession (the right to keep the owner out), she is not a tenant under a lease but only a logger,  or a licensee. The word "licensee"  describes anyone who has a permission to be on the land, such as  readers  in a library; ...A licence can be created by contract, with a regular  payment of  what  looks li ke rent, and then it may closely resemble a lease. However,

leases are interests in iand while licences are merely  personal rights: they  cannot  usually  be transferred  and will  probably  not bind  a buyer of  the land."

After  laying  down  the  legal  foundation  we  now  revert to the  issues calling for  our resolutions  in  this  appeal. Dr. Mwiburi predicated  his contention  on  the  argument that the  SAAs  were  intended  to  facilitate  a smooth co-existence between the appellant and the hunting companies and the payments made to the later were compensation for interruptions caused by the appellant's mining activities to the hunting activities. This argument has  been  gallantly  disputed  by  the  respondent.  Based  on  the  foregoing stated essential features of a lease, the question to be answered is whether the  SAAs  bear  such  characteristics  for  them  to  qualify  to  be  leases  and consequently the payments made to amount to rent which would be subject to withholding tax.

We have carefully examined the SAAs, in particular the above quoted clauses.  While  doing  so,  we  were  alive  of  one  of  the  basic  rules  of construction  and  interpretation  of transactions  on  tax  liabilities.  It  states that: -

"Substance  not  form is the basis  of  interpretation of transactions.  The courts wiii  look  at  the real  substance not  the form of the transactions; for example, it does not make any difference whether, a tax-payer labels a payment  or consideration for  services  rendered  a salary, gift, commission, pension ; gratuity, emolument or  benefit."

(See the book: INCOME TAX  IN TANZANIA by  Paul  Joseph,

First  Published  in 1990, page 5)

This principle accords with the concern by the respondent that looking at the substance, the arrangement was intended to facilitate avoidance of tax.  According  to  the  principle,  nomenclature  is  of  no  essence  but  the transaction  or arrangement.  In the  present case,  the  respondent claimed payment of withholding Tax in terms of section 83(l)(b) of the ITA arising from  payments made by the appellant to the hunting companies pressing that the payments made annually amounted to rent. That section stipulates that: -

"83.-(l) Subject to subsection (2), a resident  person who-

(a) (not  applicable)

(b) pays a setvice fee or an insurance premium with a source in United Republic to a non-resident  person shall

## withhold  income  tax  from  the  payment  at  the  rate provided  for  in paragraph 49(c) of  the First  Schedule."

Both  the  TRAT and  TRAT  were  of the  concurrent  finding  that  the payments were rent, that is to say, they interpreted the transaction as lease and the payments made to be rental charges.

A reading of the clauses, in very clear terms, shows that the appellant and the hunting companies agreed to share the resources in the property and to conduct the respective activities in the property. The property under reference was the same. The only conditions were that the mining activities should not interrupt the hunting activities and the appellant's right of access to the mining areas was restrictive, that is upon giving notice to the hunting companies.  Neither the appellant  nor the  hunting  companies surrendered possession of the property to the other. That, definitely meant they had to co-exist, as was rightly argued by Dr. Mwiburi.

Our further examination of the SAAs shows that the agreements were intended to allow the appellant to have access to the hunting activities in areas where the mining and the hunting overlap as indicated above. At the very least, the agreements did satisfy the condition that the agreement must be specific as it stated clearly the specific areas of concerns.

It is, however, plain from the clauses of the SAAs that, the agreements did not satisfy the condition that the lease should have a clear and certain beginning  and a  certain  end.  The SAAs show that both  agreements were dated  17/8/2008 but executed on  26/8/2008 and they contained common conditions on commencement and termination which stipulated thus: -

" Clause 18. Any changes, modifications, revisions or amendments to this Agreement which are mutually agreed upon by  the Parties  shall  be  incorporated  by written  instrument and effective when executed and signed by all the Parties to this  Agreement

Clause.  19. This Agreement shall be  terminated upon  the expiry of the term of  Prospecting Licence or Mining Licences or  by  mutual  agreement  between the parties.

Clause 20.  The Agreement shall become effective upon the day and year first above written as witnessed by the Parties and  shall  remain in full force and effect until it is terminated pursuant to clause 18. "(Emphasis added)

We  do  not  accept  the  proposition by  the respondent  that  the transaction  satisfied  the condition for creating  a  lease.  The  above quoted Clause 20 is self-contradictory. It reveals that the date of commencement is  the  date  when  the  agreements  were  prepared  (17/8/2008)  and  at the

same time it shows that the agreements were to  become effective when witnessed  by  the  parties,  that  is  the  date  when  they  were  executed (26/8/2008). Even the end date is also not stipulated as it is dependent upon the occurrence of an event that may lead to its termination  as stipulated under clause 18 and 20.

The transaction, therefore, could not amount to lease for want of two of crucial features that the appellant (the lessee) did not have exclusive right over  the  leased  property  and  the  duration  of the  lease  was  not  certain (specific). Much as we agree with the respondent that we should look at the substance  of the transaction  and  not form,  we  are  also  enjoined  to give effect to the intention of the parties when they entered into the agreement as  reflected in agreements  (the  SAAs).  The  circumstances  should  be seriously examined. That accords with  the caution  given to the courts  by Arden  L.  I   in National  Car  Parks  Ltd  v  Trinity  Development  Co (Banbury) Ltd [2002] 2 P&amp;CR 253 quoted in Roger's Book (supra) at page 475 that:

". . . The court must, of  course, look at the substance but, as I see it, it does not  follow from that that what the parties have said  is totally irrelevant and to be disregarded. For my  part, I

would  agree with the  judge that  some attention must  be  given to the terms which the  parties  have  agreed. On the  other  hand it must be approached with healthy skepticism , particularly\ for instance, if the parties' bargaining positions are asymmetrical.

So the court must look to the substance and not form. But it may help, in determining what the substance was, to consider whether the  parties expressed themselves in a particular way. Of course I bear in mind in Street v Mountford that the apparent  effect  of an  agreement  which , it  was  common ground, conferred exclusive possession on the occupier,  was to create a tenancy on that  ground. It would  in my  judgment be a strong thing for the law to disregard totally the parties' choice of  wording and to do so would  be inconsistent with the general  principle of  freedom of  contract  and  the  principle that documents should be interpreted as a  whole.  On the other hand, I agree with Mr.  Furber's submission that it does not give  rise  to  any presumption.  At most it is  relevant as a pointer."

The  circumstances  in  this  case  negative  the  intention  to  create  a tenancy. That said, the payments made cannot amount to rent that would have  created  a  liability  on  the  appellant  to  withhold  tax  under  section

83(l)(b) of the ITA above or in terms of section 82(l)(a) of the ITA which provides that: -

"82-(l) Subject to subsection (2), where a resident  person-

- (a) Pays  a dividend, interest, natural  resource  payment, rent or  royalty; and
- (b) ............... (not  applicable)

The  person  shall  withhold  income  tax  from  the payment at the rate provided  for in paragraph 4(b) of the First  schedule. "(Emphasis added)

In the light of the above, we agree with the proposition by Dr. Mwiburi that, the SAAs were not leases and the payments made by the appellant did not  amount  to  rent.  The  clauses  in  the  SAAs  do  not  suggest  that  the appellant had exclusive possession of the overlapping areas to the extent of being able to keep out strangers and the Hunting Companies. They contain very  certain  and  express  terms  that  the  parties  were  to  co-exist  in  the overlapping areas and therefore the money paid was not rent as Dr. Mwiburi rightly  argued.  The  liability  to  withhold  tax  did  not  therefore  arise.  This finding renders consideration of ground two (2) of appeal superflous because

the substantive claim  having failed,  payment of interest cannot arise.  We allow that ground too.

For the reasons given above, we allow the appeal, quash the decisions by both the TRAB and TRAT and set aside the consequential orders made. In the circumstances of the case, each party shall  bear its own costs both here and before the tribunals below.

A. L. KALEGEYA DEPUTY REGISTRAR COURT OF APPEAL
