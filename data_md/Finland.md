The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.
- 2. Where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.
- 3. If an enterprise of a Contracting State, which has a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State, sells goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold by the permanent establishment, or renders services of the same or similar kind as those rendered by the permanent establishment, the profits of such activities may be attributed to the permanent establishment unless the enterprise proves that such sales or services are not attributable to the activity of the permanent establishment.
- 4. In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere, but this does not include any expenses which, under the law of that State, would not be allowed to be deducted by an independent enterprise of that State.
- 5.

The method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles laid down in this Article.
- 6. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.
- 7. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

- (b) the tax chargeable on such profits in that other State shall be reduced by 50%.
- 4. If the place of effective management of a shipping enterprise is aboard a ship, then it shall be deemed to be situated in the Contracting State in which the home harbour of the ship is situated, or, if there is no such home harbour, in the Contracting State of which the operator of the ship is a resident.
- 5. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits derived from the participation in a pool, in a joint business or in an international operating agency.

## Article 9

## Associated enterprises

## [Compare: OECD Model | UN Model]

- 1. Where
- (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or
- (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

- 2. Where profits on which an enterprise of a Contracting State have been charged to tax in that State are also included in the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State and taxed accordingly and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to that enterprise of the other State if the conditions made between the enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then the first-mentioned State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged on those profits in the first-mentioned State. In determining such an adjustment due regard shall be had to other provisions of this Convention in relation to the nature of the income, and for this purpose the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.
- 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State of which the company paying the State may be taxed in that other State.
- 2. However, such dividends may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 20% of the gross amount of the dividends.

## Article 10

Dividends

[Compare: OECD Model | UN Model]

The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.

This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

- 3. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subject to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the taxation law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.
- 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the recipient of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State professional services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.
- 5.
