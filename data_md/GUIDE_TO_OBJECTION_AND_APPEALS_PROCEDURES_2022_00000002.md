## 3.0 TAX REVENUE APPEALS

Tax  Revenue  Appeal  is  the  common  way  to  resolve disagreement between parties that relate to tax matters.

## 3.1 Appellant machineries

Basically there are three appellant machineries where a taxpayer may appeal in case he disagrees with Commissioner General's decision.

## a. Appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board

The law provides that, any person who is aggrieved by an objection decision of the Commissioner General made under the Tax Administration Act may appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board.

The Board shall accept the objection under the following conditions: -

- i. A notice of appeal is served upon the Commissioner General  within  thirty  days  following  the  date  on which a notice of final determination of assessment of tax is served on the appellant;
- ii. The appeal is lodged with the Board within fortyfive days following the date on which the notice of final determination of assessment of tax is served on the appellant; and
- iii. The notice should give all details relating to the tax assessment  and  further  correspondences  made between the Commissioner General and the taxpayer.

## b. Appeal to the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal

A party who is aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal against the decision to the Tribunal under the following conditions: -

- i.  The  appellant  shall  serve  the  opposite  party  the notice of intention to appeal within fifteen days from the  date  of  the  decision  and  appeal  against  that decision to the Tribunal within thirty days from the date of service of the decision and proceedings of the Board.
- ii. The Board or Tribunal, may extend the limit of time set by the law if it is satisfied that the failure by a party to give notice of appeal, lodge an appeal or to effect service to the opposite party was

occasioned by the following reason; absence from the United Republic, sickness or other reasonable cause, subject to such terms and conditions as to costs as it may consider just and appropriate.

## c. Appeal to the Court of Appeal

Any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the tribunal may refer an appeal to the Court of appeal. The appeal shall rely on matters involving questions of law only, the provisions of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act and the court of appeal rules made thereunder shall apply without affecting the main subject at issue (mutatis mutandis) to appeals from the decision of the Tribunal.

Where  an  objector  prefers  an  appeal  to  the  Tax Appeals  Board,  to  the  Tax Appeals  Tribunal  and the court of appeal, any tax deposited as required by the law, shall continue to remain deposited with Commissioner General pending the final determination of the appeal.
