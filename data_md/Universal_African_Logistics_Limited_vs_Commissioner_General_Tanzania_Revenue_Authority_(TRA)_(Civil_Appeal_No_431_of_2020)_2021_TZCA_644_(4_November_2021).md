Tax Appeal No. 21 of 2018

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

18th  October &amp; 4th  November, 2021

## NDIKA, J.A.:

The  essence  of  this  matter  is  the  question  whether  the  appellant, Universal African Logistics Limited, is liable to pay TZS.  1,617,932,388.00 as additional value added tax ("VAT") and  interest thereon amounting to TZS. 411,972,225.00  for  the  years  2011,  2012  and  2013  as  assessed  by  the respondent,  the  Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority.  The question  was  determined  in  the  affirmative  by  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Board  ("the  Board")/  at  the  first  instance,  and the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  ("the  Tribunal"),  on  appeal.  Still  discontented,  the  appellant  now appeals to this Court.

The essential facts of the case, as summarized by the Tribunal, are as follows: the appellant is a company incorporated in Tanzania and headquartered  in  Mwanza.  Trading  in  the  name  of  Kilimanjaro  Aviation Logistics Centre, the appellant engaged  in the business of coordinating and organizing permits for landing and navigation for private aviation within the African  continent.  In  doing  so,  the  appellant  used  her  local  expertise  and continent-wide network of proven suppliers to enable her clients obtain the correct permits, clearances and permissions for their entire trips.

On 24t h  August,  2010,  Deloitte Consulting  Limited, the appellant's tax advisors,  submitted  a  letter  to  the  respondent  (Exhibit  A-l)  seeking  the interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the Value Added Tax Act, Cap.  148 R.E.  2002 ("the VAT Act").  It is noteworthy that this law was repealed by the Value Added Tax  Act, 2014, now Cap.  148 R.E.  2019. The respondent replied vide a letter dated 1s t  September, 2010 (Exhibit A-2) confirming,  based  on the facts from the scenario  presented  in  Exhibit A-l, that  the entire business  activities  are made  outside  Tanzania, " these transactions are falling outside the ambit of the  VAT  Act and therefore will not be considered as a taxable supply as [far as] the VA  T  law is concerned."

In  the  year  2014,  the  respondent  conducted  a  tax  audit  on  the appellant's  affairs  for  the  years  of  income  2011,  2012  and  2013.  It  was

realized that the appellant had  not paid VAT in respect of the supply of the aforesaid  services  on  the  ground  that  the  said  services  were  zero-rated. Consequently, the respondent issued assessment for additional VAT of T7S. 1,617,932,388.00 and interest thereon amounting to TZS. 411,972.225.00.

The  appellant  resented  the  assessment  and  hence  filed  a  notice  of objection disputing the assessed amount by providing  her operational chart and  brief explanation  of  her  business  and  the  nature  of the  transactions involved.  Furthermore,  the  appellant  submitted  that  she  was  acting  as  an agent  of  her  affiliate,  a  non-resident  principal  company  called  Universal Weather  and  Aviation,  Inc.  ("UWA"),  to  coordinate  the  logistics  across different countries in Africa.

The  respondent  replied  vide  her  letter  of  20t h   July,  2015  that  the services rendered by the appellant were VAT chargeable at the prevailing rate of 18% and that the assessment for additional VAT and interest thereon was correct.  The  appellant's  initial  appeal  to  the  Board  against  the  aforesaid decision bore no fruit. Her further appeal to the Tribunal too came to naught, hence the present appeal predicated on three grounds thus:

- 1. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal grossly erred in  law by holding that the appellant is not an agent of  Universal Weather and Aviation, Inc.

- 2.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal grossly erred in  law by holding that the appellant was supplying standard rated services.
- 3.  That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  grossly  erred  by  holding that the  respondent  was justified to  impose  interest on  the  disputed amounts.

At  the  hearing  of  the  appeal  before  us,  Dr.  Abel  Mwiburi,  learned counsel,  stood  for  the  appellant  whereas  Messrs.  Juma  Kisongo,  Harold Gugami, Thomas Buki and Hospis Maswanyia, learned Senior State Attorneys, teamed up to represent the respondent. In their respective oral arguments, the learned counsel  highlighted their written submissions for or against the appeal along with the list of authorities filed.

We begin with the first ground of appeal contending that the Tribunal grossly  erred  in  law  by  holding  that  the  appellant  was  not  UWA's  agent. Certainly, this ground assails the Tribunal's decision, at pages 491 and 492 of the record of appeal, upholding the Board's finding against the appellant. The impugned holding reads thus:

"We therefore agree with the findings of the Board that the appellant failed to produce sufficient evidence  to  prove  that  there was  agency relationship  (implied)  between  the  appellant and Universal Weather and  Aviation.

As correctly submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent in reaching its decision , the Board did not

rely  only  on  the  absence  of  the  written  agency agreement It reviewed the totality of the arrangements between  the appellant and Universal Weather and Aviation  as  reflected in  documentary evidence that was made available to the Board.

We  do  not  subscribe  to  the  submission  of  the appellant's counsel that the act of the appellant to issue tax invoices to  jet operators through the care of Universal  Weather and Aviation and not directly to Universal  Weather and Aviation  is an  admission  or evidence that there is  a relationship which is  principa / -agent relationship. As correctly held by the Board, in normal circumstances if  the appellant  is the agent of  Universal Weather  and  Aviation  it  was expected that those invoices were to be sent directly to Universal Weather and  Aviation as a principal and in return Universal Weather and Aviation had to pay commission to the appellant as his agent but unfortunately this was not the case. "[Emphasis added]

Dr.  Mwiburi  started  off  arguing  that  the  above  holding  was  a   total misapprehension of the facts and the law. Citing sections 138 and 139 of the Law of Contract Act, Cap. 345 R.E. 2002 he contended that the authority of an  agent could  be  either  express  or  implied  and  that the  existence  of an agency could be proved  not just by documentary evidence but it could also

be  inferred  from  the  conduct  of the  parties.  The  Tribunal,  it  was  further argued, concentrated on the nomenclature used in the appellant's financial statement instead of examining and considering the totality of the arrangements  between the appellant and  UWA to determine  if the alleged principal-agent relationship existed.

Elaborating on the alleged arrangements,  Dr.  Mwiburi stated that the process of delivery of the services by the appellant was initiated by a business jet owner communicating  his flight plan to  UWA.  UWA would then engage the  appellant  to  provide  the  necessary  logistical  support  services  to  the business jet owner on  behalf of UWA in  respect of the flights over Africa's airspace as the best option for logistics. The appellant would pay all requisite navigation  fees  on behalf  of  the business  jet  owners  and  that  upon completion of the services, the appellant would issue tax invoices (sampled invoices admitted as Exhibit R-l) to UWA in respect of the services rendered by her to UWA's customers acting as UWA's agent. Each invoice would contain two  cost  elements:  first,  navigation  fees  and  charges  paid  to  different authorities on behalf of the jet owners, which, then, are reimbursable without any mark up; and secondly, fees for logistical services covering indirect and direct costs plus a profit margin.  It was, therefore, argued that based  upon this business  operations  model,  the  appellant  had no  direct business

interactions  with  the  jet  owners  but  was  used  as  a  conduit  of  UWA  for delivering services to her customers flying over Africa's airspace.

Referring  to  Pollock  &amp;  Mulla's  book, The  Indian  Contract  and Special  Relief  Act, 14t h Edition,  2012,  as  well  as  the  case  of Babulal Swarupchand  Shah  v.  South  Satara  (Fixed  Delivery)  Merchants Assan Ltd (1960) Bom 671 AIR 1960 Bom 48, 62 Bom LR 304,  Dr. Mwiburi posited that the test of agency is whether the person is purporting to enter transactions on behalf of the principal. That the relationship of principal-agent may  be  constituted  either  by  express  appointment  by  the  principal  or  by implication of law or  by subsequent ratification  by the  principal  of the acts done on  his  behalf.  That the  law  does  not ordinarily  require  a  contract of agency to be created except where the statute specifically requires that the authority  should  be  conferred  not orally  but  in  writing.  The  Tribunal  was, therefore, faulted for failing to scrutinize the true nature of the relationship as well as the functions and responsibilities of the appellant as UWA's agent.

Replying  for  the  respondent,  Mr.  Gugami  conceded  that  a  principalagent relationship may be express or implied and that an implied agency can be inferred from the conduct of the parties. However, he countered that the appellant  presented  no  documentary  or  other  evidence  proving  that  UWA used to secure customers and instruct the appellant to give services to the

said customers on behalf of UWA. That the alleged arrangements on delivery of services only came from the mouth of the counsel for the appellant.

Mr.  Gugami  supported  the  concurrent finding  by  the  Board  and  the Tribunal that the appellant did not issue the tax invoices (Exhibit R-l) to UWA upon completion of the services but that they were issued directly to the jet operators  care  of  UWA.  Based  on  Exhibit  R-l,  it  was  contended  that  the appellant  had  direct  interaction  with  the jet  operators  except that the  tax invoices were sent to the operators through UWA.

It is common ground that the appellant did not produce any document showing that she was appointed or given express authority by her affiliate, UWA, to act as  her agent.  On that basis,  both the  Board  and  the Tribunal were  cognizant  that  the nature  of  the relationship between  the  two companies could only be inferred from the conduct between them. Certainly, the main, if not the only, piece of evidence portraying their relationship was constituted by the sample of tax invoices (Exhibit R-l), at pages 53 to 56 of the record of appeal, issued by the appellant. Looking at the invoice at page 53 of the record as an illustration,  it is discernible that it was issued  by the appellant  in  respect  of  the  operator  named "Flicape  (Pty)  Limited,  C/O Universal  Weather and Aviation,  Inc v 8787 Tally  ho Road,  Houston,  Texas USA 77061 , Phone: 713-944-1622." As we understand the phrase "care of"

to mean "at the address of", we uphold the view that the invoice was issued directly to the Flicape (Pty) Limited and that it was dispatched at the address of the UWA.

We recall that Dr. Mwiburi reviewed the various aspects of the invoices including  the  payment  options  and  the  components  of the  charged  fees, submitting that the invoices proved the alleged agency. It is noteworthy that as  regards  payment  options,  the  invoices  instructed  the  jet  operators  as follows:

PAYMENT OPTIONS: Please remit funds to Company Name using one of the following options:

## Payment Instructions per agreement with:

Universal Weather and Aviation, Inc.

While acknowledging that each  payment was supposedly made to the appellant,  Dr.  Mwiburi  argued that the detail "Payment Instructions per agreement with: Universal Weather and Aviation,  Inc." was an  indication that the jet operators against whom the invoices were issued were customers of UWA with whom they had agreements and, therefore, the appellant dealt with the jet operators through  UWA supposedly as an agent.  Dr.  Mwiburi's submission  seems  attractive  and  forceful.  However,  the  appellant  did  not produce  any  such  agreements  between  UWA  and  the  jet  operators  to illustrate the underlying relationship. It is our respectful view that the failure

to do so entitled any prudent tribunal of fact to draw an adverse inference against the appellant's case. This view is particularly reinforced  by the fact that  the  appellant  produced  no  evidence  to  prove  the  substance  of  her relationship with UWA, on the one hand, and the jet operators, on the other, except the sampled invoices. On this basis, we agree with  Mr.  Gugami that the invoices apart, the characterisation of the appellant as UWA's agent was mostly  based  on  the  appellant's  word  of  mouth  as  opposed  to  cogent evidence that would  have established that the appellant acted  in the name and on  behalf of UWA in delivering the services.  Under the circumstances, we do not detect any apparent misapprehension of the evidence on  record and  the  law  in  respect  of  the  Tribunal's  finding  that  the  alleged  agency relationship was unproven. The first ground stands dismissed.

We now turn to the second ground of appeal that the Tribunal grossly erred  in  law  by  holding  that  the  appellant  was  supplying  standard  rated services.

Submitting  on  the above ground,  Dr.  Mwiburi  essentially argued that the appellant's services were zero-rated. Citing sections 4 (1), 7 (4) and 9 (1) of the VAT Act together with Paragraph 9 (2) (b) (ii) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act on  supply of ancillary transport activities such  as  loading  and unloading handling and similar services, he argued  that  the physical

performance  of such  services  after  landing  is  done  pursuant  to  a  landing permit  secured  by  the  appellant  connotes  that  the  service  was  rendered outside  Tanzania  and,  therefore,  such  service  must  be  zero-rated.  The learned  counsel  maintained  that  although  the  services  of  organising  the landing  permits  are  carried  out  in  Tanzania,  the  underlying  transaction  in relation to these services is flying over the Africa's airspace, which happens and  is  supplied  outside  Tanzania.  Hence,  such  services  are  zero-rated  in terms of section 9 (1)  of the VAT Act and  Item  2   Note  (b)  (v) of the  First Schedule to the VAT Act. According to Dr. Mwiburi, Item 2 Note (b) (v) reads thus:

"2 . For  the  purposes  of this  Schedule,  goods  or services  are  treated  as  exported  from  the  United Republic of Tanzania if:

(b) in the case of  services, the service is supplied  for use or consumption outside the United Republic of Tanzania as evidenced by documentary proof acceptable by the Commissioner."[ Emphasis added]

The  learned  counsel  specifically  urged  the  Court  to  determine  what services were supplied by the appellant and where they were consumed. On the services supplied,  he maintained that the appellant supplied services of securing landing permits  across  Africa  and  that  such  services  became complete when landing of the jet was done in the country for which  permit was issued. As to where the services were consumed, it was submitted that the  place  of consumption  is "the  place  where  the  airspace  and  landing  is made."

Replying,  Mr.  Gugami  agreed  that  Tanzania  applies  the  destination principle in charging VAT on supplies of goods or services but that the law imposes a  restricted  or deeming approach with  respect to the treatment of exportation and zero-rating of supplies of services to the extent that a service may  be  consumed  or  enjoyed  outside  Tanzania  but  fail  to  qualify  for treatment  as  exported  supply  and  hence  deemed  by  law  to  have  been destined in Tanzania.  For this proposition, section 7 (4) of the VAT Act read together with Note (b) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act and Regulation 6 (1) of the Value Added Tax (Export of Goods and Services) Regulations, 2009, G.N. No. 91 of 2009 ("the VAT Export Regulations") were cited.

Elaborating further, Mr.  Gugami submitted that zero-rating of supplies of goods of services is governed  by section 9 of the VAT Act read together with the First Schedule to that Act  and the VAT Export Regulations. That the relevant  provision  for  the  present  purposes  is  Note  (b)  (v)  of  the  First Schedule to the VAT Act as amended by the Finance Act No.  13 of 2008 and Regulation  6  (1)  of the  VAT  Export  Regulations  both  of which  are  in pari

materia. These  provisions stipulate that the supply of services rendered  by an intermediary acting for another person, shall be treated as being exported only when the underlying transaction is supplied outside Tanzania.

The phrase "underlying transaction", it was submitted, refers, according to Regulation 2 of the VAT Export Regulations, to principal business, deal or matter. Thus,  Mr.  Gugami  argued that the appellant's  principal  business of coordinating,  organising,  arranging,  processing  and  obtaining  landing  and navigation permits is what constitutes her underlying business as opposed to flying over Africa's airspace as alleged by the appellant's counsel. Relying on section  6   of the  VAT Act that a  service  is  supplied  when  it  is  rendered  or performed,  it  was  stressed  that  the  appellant  performed  her  services  of organising  permits at  Mwanza  in Tanzania.  As such,  the services were  not zero-rated but standard-rated.

The learned counsel went on submitting that the text to Item  2   Note (b) (v) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act cited by his learned friend as the basis for the claimed zero-rating of the appellant's services was dead law as it  was  amended  successively  by the  Finance  Act,  No.  15  of 2003  and  the Finance Act, No.  13 of 2008. He argued that following the amendments, the law  at the  material  time  was  that all  supplies  of services  were  treated  as supplied in Tanzania where the supplier belongs except supplies of services

which  may  be treated  as exported  meeting  the export conditions set forth under Note (b) (i) to (vii) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act.

It was Mr.  Gugami's further contention that even  if the appellant had complied with the requirement under Note (b) (v) of the First Schedule to the VAT Act which was identical to the requirement under Regulation 6 (1) of the VAT  Export  Regulations,  Regulation  6  (2)  of the  VAT  Export  Regulations qualifies Regulation 6 (1) by providing that services qualifying for zero-rating are those for which the intermediary receives commission from the principal. So far as the instant matter is concerned, the learned counsel contended that it was established  before the  Board that the appellant did  not  receive any commission from  UWA,  meaning that her services did  not qualify for zerorating.

We find it convenient to note that in terms of section 4 (1) of the VAT Act,  VAT was  chargeable  on  any  supply  of goods  or  services  in  Mainland Tanzania where it is a taxable supply made by a taxable person in the course of or furtherance of any business carried on by him. Section 7 (4) of the VAT Act defined "place of supply" of services as follows:

"(4) Services  shall  be regarded  as  supplied  in Mainland Tanzania if  the supplier of  the services(a) has a place of  business in Mainland Tanzania and no place of  business elsewhere;

(b) has no place of  business in Mainland Tanzania or elsewhere  but  his  usual  place  of residence  is  in Mainland Tanzania; or

(c) has places of  business in Mainland Tanzania and elsewhere but the place of  business most concerned with the supply  of  the services is the  place of  business in Mainland Tanzania."

It was  common  ground  that  paragraph  (c)  of section  7  (4)  above  is applicable to the matter at hand in view of the appellant's arrangements and operations at Mwanza as well as with its affiliate, UWA, in the United States.

So far as zero-rating of goods and services is concerned, section 9 (1) of the VAT Act provided that:

"A supply of  goods or services is zero-rated by virtue of this sub-section  if the supply is of a  description specified in the First  Schedule to this A ct "

Item  1  of the First Schedule to the VAT Act specified that exportation of goods and taxable services from the United Republic of Tanzania as zero­ rated  provided evidence of exportation was produced to the satisfaction of the  Commissioner. However,  the  zero-rating  treatment  was  subject  to following notes, which, as rightly argued by Mr. Gugami, were introduced by an amendment made by section 49 of the Finance Act, Act No.  13 of 2008:

## "Notes:

For  purposes of  items 1  and  2 -

- (a) [Not relevant]
- (b) all  supplies  of services  are  treated  as  being supplied in the place  where the supplier belongs as defined in subsection (4) of  section 7 except supplies of  services which may be treated as being exported only  when  such  services are physically carried out outside the United Republic of Tanzania , subject to documentary proof acceptable to the Commissioner as follows -
- (i) to (iv) [Not relevant]
- (v) the supply of  services rendered by an intermediary acting in the name and on behaif of  another  person shall  be treated  as  being exported only when the underlying transaction is supplied outside the United Republic of Tanzania;

(vi) to (vii) [Not relevant]"[Er(\phdiS\s added]

In view of the above clear provisions, we would agree with Mr. Gugami that Note (b)  (v),  as worded  above,  is  relevant to the  present dispute and that  the  text  cited  by  D r.  Mwiburi  as  being  the  letter  of the  said  note  is incorrect.  Thus, pursuant  to  Note  (b)  (v),  which  is  in pari  materia to Regulation 6 (1) of the VAT Export Regulations, it is clear that the supply of services rendered  by an intermediary in the name and on behalf of another is  treated  as  being  exported  when the  underlying  transaction  is supplied

outside the United Republic of Tanzania. As rightly argued  by Mr.  Gugami, Regulation  6  (2)  of  the  VAT  Export  Regulations  also  stipulated  a  further condition  that the  service claimed  to  have  been  exported  must  be one for which the intermediary received commission from the principal.

We have upheld the Tribunal's finding that the appellant did not act as UWA's agent when delivering the services. However, as did the Tribunal, we would assume that the appellant acted as UWA's intermediary in delivering the services so as to determine whether the two conditions above were met.

Beginning with whether the underlying transaction was supplied outside the  United  Republic  of Tanzania,  with  respect  we  do  not  agree  with  Dr. Mwiburi that the supplied services of securing navigation and landing permits across Africa that became complete upon the jets concerned landing in the country for which the permits were issued amounted to exported services. It is  undisputed  that  all  activities  of  organising,  arranging  and  securing  the navigation and landing permits as the appellant's principal business in terms of Regulation 2 of the VAT Export Regulations were done at the appellant's centre  in  Mwanza.  We  think  once  the  required  permits  had  been  sought, obtained and delivered to the jet operators, the services would be completed. The flying over the Africa's airspace or landing at an airport upon a  permit secured by the appellant is not,  by any yardstick, a service rendered by the

appellant. Consequently, we endorse the concurrent finding by the Board and the Tribunal  that the  services  in  this  matter  were  rendered  in  the  United Republic of Tanzania.

The issue whether the appellant as an assumed intermediary of UWA received commission for the services rendered  poses no difficulty.  Both tax courts  below were concurrent that there was no  proof of such  payment to the appellant by UWA. This is yet another ground disqualifying the appellant's services from zero-rating. That said, the second ground of appeal fails.

Finally,  we deal with the complaint that the Tribunal grossly erred  by holding that the respondent was justified to impose interest on the disputed amounts of tax.

Dr. Mwiburi premised his submission on the principle that interest would be payable if liability to pay tax is legally established and that it was not paid at the time  it was due.  In  the  instant case,  it  was  his  argument that the alleged  VAT liability  was  factually  and  legally  misconceived.  He  contended further that since the  appellant structured  her  operations  acting  upon  the respondent's advice  (Exhibit A-2) confirming that the envisaged  underlying transactions would not be considered as a taxable supply on the ground that they fell outside the ambit of the VAT Act, the imposition of interest on the allegedly delayed tax was unjustified.

The learned counsel  went on to  recall that the Tribunal  relied on the decision of the Supreme Court of Kenya in Income Tax Commissioner v. AK [1964]  EA  648  at  652  as  well  as  this  Court's  decision  in Roshani Meghjee  &amp;  Co.  Ltd.  v.  Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  49  of  2008  (unreported)  for  holding  that  no estoppel whatever its nature can operate to annul statutory provisions and a statutory person cannot be estopped from  performing  his statutory duty or from  denying  that he entered  into an  agreement which  was  ultra vires for him to make.  However,  he countered that the respondent being a statutory organ  vested  with  the  power  to  administer  the  tax  laws  is  duty  bound  to advise its customers (taxpayers) correctly and diligently. Any advice given by the respondent should not operate against the taxpayer if the taxpayer acted on it.  He added that the advice given constituted a private ruling which was binding on the  respondent. To bolster his submission,  he  referred  us to an article by Martin Atlas, The Doctrine of Estoppel in Tax Cases, Tax Law Review, Vol. 3, No.  1  (October/November),  1947, p.72-81.

Replying,  Mr.  Gugami  submitted  that the  appellant was  liable to  pay VAT on the services she rendered for the years 2011 through 2013 because the said  services were  not zero-rated supplies and, therefore,  her omission to pay the tax due rendered herself liable to pay interest on the unpaid tax.

Refuting the claim that interest was unwarranted  because the delay to pay the tax arose from the respondent's advice that the services were zero-rated, he made two points.  First,  he submitted that the opinion in Exhibit A-2 was given by the respondent to Deloitte Consulting Limited who had requested it for  a  client  dubbed  as  ABC-Tanzania, not  the  appellant. Secondly,  he contended that the said opinion could  not override the law and that on the authority of Roshani Meghjee {supra) cited by the Board and the Tribunal, the respondent could  not be estopped from applying the law correctly and departing from a wrong opinion given by its officer. He added that the advice was, in terms of the applicable at the material time, not a private ruling for it to be binding.

In a  brief rejoinder,  Dr.  Mwiburi  conceded that Exhibit A-2 was  not a binding "private ruling", a concept created and governed by sections 1 1  and 12 of the Tax Administration Act,  2015,  now Cap.  438 of 2019,  which was enacted  in  2015  almost  five  years  after  the  opinion  in  dispute  had  been issues.  However,  he went on distinguishing the case of Roshani Meghjee {supra) on the ground that it concerned an opinion issued by the respondent that  was  subsequently  withdrawn  which  was  not  the  case  in  the  instant dispute.

We examined the appellant's request for the  respondent's opinion on VAT on exported  agency services (Exhibit A-l)  and  the  respondent's  reply thereto (Exhibit A-2)  in the  light of the written and oral  submissions of the learned counsel for the parties. To begin with, we note that the request for opinion  by  the  appellant's  tax  consultants  (Exhibit  A-l)  contains  a  full disclosure  of  the nature  of  the proposed  services  and  the  underlying arrangements.  We  further  note  from  Exhibit  A-2  that  in  response  to  the request for opinion, the respondent confirmed that the proposed transactions fell outside the ambit of the VAT Act and that they would not be vatable.

However, we would agree with  Mr.  Gugami that Exhibit A-l does not mention  the  appellant  as  the  taxpayer  for  whom  the  advice  was  sought. Instead, the said opinion was clearly intended for an unidentified client of the tax  consultants  simply  codenamed  as  ABC-Tanzania,  a  subsidiary  of  a company assumed to have been formed in the United Kingdom, called XYZ (UK)  Ltd.  In  the  premises,  the  claim  that the  opinion  in  issue  should  not operate against the appellant as a taxpayer on the ground that it was acted upon  by the appellant does not arise.  It negates the appellant's claim that she relied upon the respondent's opinion given to her to her detriment.

Specifically on  the  question  of estoppel,  we  are  unpersuaded  by  Dr. Mwiburi's submission that the respondent being a statutory organ vested with

the power to administer the tax laws should  be estopped from denying the commanding  adherence or bindingness on it of its opinions to taxpayers. It is our respectful view that our decision in Roshani Meghjee {supra) settled the law that there is no estoppel against the performance of a statutory duty. By  way  of emphasis,  we  wish  to  extract  a  quotation  from Income Tax Commissioner {supra), which  was the  basis  of our  decision  in Roshani Meghjee {supra)'.

7 understand  the  law  to  be  that  no  estoppel whatever its nature,  can operate to annul statutory provisions and  a statutory  person cannot  be estopped from performing his statutory duty or from denying that he entered into an agreement which  was ultra vires for  him to make. A statutory  person can only perform acts which he is empowered  to perform. Estoppel cannot negative the operation of  a statute and it is a public duty to obey the law. "[Emphasis added]

We have read Martin Atlas' article referred to us by Dr.  Mwiburi in  his oral argument. It is on the application of the doctrine of estoppel in tax cases within the context of the laws of the United States.  How Atlas' commentary could advance the appellant's submission in this matter is unclear. We say so as it is notable that while he observes at page 87, after reviewing a string of

authorities  on  the  subject,  that  estoppel " comes  into  play  against  the taxpayers  with  great  frequency and in  a  myriad of circumstances '' he concludes at the same page, that:

"[t]he largest area where estoppel will not come into effect against Government is with respect to opinions or rulings issued by the Treasury."

The  above  position  would  hold  true  in  respect  of  the  respondent's opinions at time material to this dispute. We would, therefore, reiterate that the position in Roshani Meghjee {supra) on estoppel against the government remains settled.

However, we would  hasten to acknowledge that the procedure under sections 1 1  and  12 of the TAA by which the respondent is empowered, upon application,  to  render  a  private  or  class  ruling  setting  out  position  on  the application of a tax law to an arrangement proposed or entered into will allow taxpayers to hold the respondent to its position on a question upon which a ruling  is  given.  This  procedure  clearly  provides  a  major  inroad  into  the doctrine of estoppel against the government as it seeks to give protections to taxpayers. Nevertheless, so far as this matter is concerned we uphold the Tribunal's finding  that the  interest imposed  on  the  appellant was justified. The third ground of appeal falls apart.

In the final analysis, we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed from was right and must be affirmed. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal with costs.
