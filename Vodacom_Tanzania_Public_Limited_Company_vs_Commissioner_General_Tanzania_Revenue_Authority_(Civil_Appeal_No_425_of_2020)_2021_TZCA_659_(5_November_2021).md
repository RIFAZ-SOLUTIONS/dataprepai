## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

28th  October &amp; 5t h  November, 2021.

## MWAMBEGELE, J.A.:

Vodacom  Tanzania Public Limited Company, formerly known  as Vodacom  Tanzania Limited, appeals  against  the decision of  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  (the  Tribunal)  in  Tax  Appeal  No.  22  of  2015 handed  down  on  10.11.2017  in  which  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) was upheld. In that decision, the appellant was ordered  to  pay  the  Commissioner  General  of Tanzania  Revenue  Authority (the respondent) the sum of Tshs. 1,028,644,778/87 and Tshs.

1,917,171,792/=  as,  respectively,  withholding  tax  and  penalties  on  the services and royalty for the years of income from 2001 to 2004.

The  background  to the appeal  before  us can  be  stated  in  brief.  The appellant is a company registered  under the laws of Tanzania dealing with telecommunication  network  and  wireless  services.  The  respondent  is  a revenue  collector  for  the  Government  of  Tanzania.  On  10.11.2006,  the respondent served on the appellant preliminary audit findings after he had conducted  a  tax  audit  earlier  on.  A  meeting  between  the  parties  was convened  to  consider  the  appellant's  misgivings  on  the  preliminary  audit findings  after  which  the  respondent  revised  the  preliminary  audit  findings on  24.04.2007.  The  revised  preliminary  audit  findings  did  not  make  the appellant  happy.  Another  meeting  was thus  reconvened  and  the  issues of complaint  by  the  appellant  with  regard  to  the  revised  preliminary  audit findings were addressed. As a result, on 29.12.2007, the respondent issued a  final  audit  report,  which  did  not  make  the  appellant  happy  either.  She thus appealed to the  Board.  Her  main  complaint before the  Board,  as can be gleaned from the statement of appeal appearing at p.  119 of the record of appeal,  was that the  respondent ought not to  have  required  her to  pay withholding  tax  on payments  made  for  acquisition  of  software  licence granted to her exclusively for her data transmission purposes.

The  Board  disagreed  with  the  appellant.  It  held  that the  respondent was entitled to withholding  tax for payments she  made to  her supplier for the  software  licence.  Aggrieved,  the  appellant  appealed  to  the  Tribunal which,  though  for somewhat different  reasons,  upheld  the  decision  of the Board. Still aggrieved, the appellant has lodged this appeal on five grounds of complaint, namely:

- 1.  The  Honourable Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  grossly  misdirected itself and erred  in  law in  holding that payments for the  right to  use software should attract royalty;
- 2.  The Honourable  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in arriving  at  its  decision  by  holding  that  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Board  had  determined  and  well  settled  that  payments for the  right to use the software constituted a royalty;
- 3.  The Honourable  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in holding that payments  for  the right to use the software are chargeable to  tax  in  the  form  of withholding  tax  under  section  34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act,  1973;

- 4.  The  Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  by  its failure  to  give effect  to  the  correct  interpretation of  the  word 'royalty' as use under section 2 of the Income Tax Act,  1973; and
- 5.  The  Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  erred  in  law  by  its failure to strictly interpret a taxing  provision contrary to the cardinal principle governing interpretation of taxing statutes.

At  the hearing  of  the  appeal before  us,  the  appellant  appeared through  Mr.  Yohanes Konda  and  Dr.  Erasmo  Nyika,  learned advocates.  On the  other hand, Mr. Juma  Kisongo, learned Principal State  Attorney, assisted  by  Messrs.  Harold  Gugami  and  Marcel  Busegano,  learned  Senior State  Attorneys,  joined  forces  to  represent  the  respondent.  Both  parties had  earlier  on  filed  written submissions  in  support  of  their  respective positions  which  they  successfully  sought  to  adopt  as  part  of  their  oral arguments before us.

It was Dr.  Nyika who submitted for the appellant.  He argued grounds 1,  3   and  4  conjointly  and  the  remaining  grounds  2   and  5   were  argued separately.

The essence of the appellant's  arguments on  grounds  1 ,  3   and  4  in the written  submissions and the oral  arguments  by  Dr.  Nyika  before  us,  is that  it was  an  error for the Tribunal  to  hold  that  payment for the  right to use  software  constitutes  royalty  and  thus  subject to  withholding  tax.  It  is the  appellant's  contention  that  the  Tribunal  wrongly  interpreted  the  term "royalty"  under  section  2   of the  Income  Tax  Act,  1973.  Dr.  Nyika  was  of the contention that acquisition of software is different from acquisition of a copyright  in the software. In the former, he submitted,  a  person  only  obtains  the  permission  to  use  the  software  in running computers  of  the purchaser. He argued that software is a commodity  and  its  use  expires  upon  the  expiry  of  the  licence.  It  was submitted  that  in  this  appeal  the  appellant  acquired  the  right  to  use  the software,  she did  not acquire the  right to  use  a  copyright of the software. According  to  him,  the  right  to  use  the  software  does  not  attract  tax  as distinct from the right to use a copyright of the software which does.

In  the circumstances,  it was argued, the Tribunal  improperly defined the  term  "royalty"  under  section  2  of  the  Income  Tax  Act, 1973  and improperly applied  the  provisions of section  34  (1)  (c)  of the  Income Tax Act,  1973.

The  respondent's  answer  to  the  appellant's  submissions, in the written submissions and the oral address through  Mr. Juma  Kisongo before us, is essentially  that  the payment  on  the  purchase  of  the  software constituted  a  royalty  which  attracted  payment of withholding  tax  on  it  as

per section  34  (1)  (c)  of the  Income Tax  Act,  1973. It was submitted  by the respondent that most software purchase agreements are titled software  licence  agreement  rather  than  software  purchase  agreement.  It was  argued  that  as  per  section  34  (1)  (c)  of the  Income  Tax  Act,  1973, payment made for acquisition  of computer software  is  payment for  lease, therefore  royalty  subject  of  withholding  tax. He  added  that  the  issue whether  such  payment  for  the  purchase  of  software  is  a  royalty  is  not novel as it was  traversed by  the  Court  in Celtel  Tanzania Ltd  v. Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal No.  56 of 2018 (unreported) in which the Court took the view that payment for  using  a  software  is  a  royalty  thus  subject  to  withholding  tax.  The respondent added that the position was reiterated in National Microfinance  Bank  Tanzania  Limited  v.  Commissioner  General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 168 of 2018 (unreported).

Rejoining,  Dr.  Nyika  reiterated  his  stance  in  the  submissions-in-chief and  added  that Celtel  Tanzania  Ltd (supra)  was  distinguishable  in  that the Court relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal  of Kenya  in Kenya Commercial Bank Limited v. Kenya Revenue Authority [2016] eKLR,

which  dealt with  a  different  provision  of law;  not in pari materia with  the section under discussion.

We  have  considered  the  rival  arguments  by  the  learned  counsel  for the  parties.  Having  so  done,  we  think  the  issue  we  are  called  upon  to decide that arises from  grounds  1 ,  3   and  4  is whether the  payment made by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd for purchase of  computer  software  constitutes  royalty.  We  find  it  appropriate,  at  the very outset of our determination, to define the meaning of the term as can be gleaned from our legislation. The term "royalty" is defined  by section  2 of the Income Tax Act,  1973 which was applicable then as under:

""royalty" means any payment made as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use-

- (a)  any  copyright  of literary, artistic  or  scientific work; or
- (b)  any cinematograph  film ; including  film  or tape for radio or television broadcasting; or
- (c)  any patent ; trademark , design  or model,  plan, formula or process; or
- (d) any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment;

or for information concerning industrial,  commercial or scientific equipment or experience,  and includes

## gains  derived  from  the  sale  or  exchange  of any right or  property  giving rise to such royalty [Emphasis supplied].

The appellant  placed  emphasis  on  the words "for the  use  of,  or the right to  use" shown  in  the  bold  expression  above.  We  shall  revert to  this point later in this judgment.

The Tribunal  agreed  with the finding of the Board.  However,  despite the  fact  that  the  Tribunal  observed  that  it  agreed  with  the  Board  on  its reasoning  and  verdict,  we  are  afraid,  the  verdict  of the  Tribunal  and  the Board's were the same  but not the reasoning thereof.  We say so because, while  the  Board  held  that  the  payment  made  by  the  appellant  to  M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd for purchase of computer software is taxable in terms of section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act,  1973, that is, as "any rent, premium  or  like consideration for the use or occupation  of property", the  Tribunal  held  that  the  same  was  taxable under,  purportedly,  the  same  section  34  (1)  (c)  of the  Income  Tax  Act, 1973, as "royalty". To unveil the somewhat contradiction  by the Board and Tribunal  in  their  reference  to  the  same  paragraph  and  sub-section  (1)  of section 34, we find it apt to reproduce section 34 (1) (c) of the Income Tax Act,  1973, which was applicable then. It reads:

"34.-(1)  Every person  shall ' upon payment of any amount  to  any  non-resident person  not  having  a permanent establishment in  the  United Republic in respect of-

- (a) any management or professional fee;

## (b) any royalty;

## (c)  any  rent,  premium  or like  consideration for the use or occupation of  property;

- (d) any dividend;
- (e) any interest; or

(f) any  pension or retirement annuity, which is chargeable to tax,  deduct therefrom tax at the appropriate non-resident withholding tax rate."

## [Emphasis supplied].

After a  close  look at the  provisions of the  law  referred  to,  we think, the  Board  and  the  Tribunal  used  different  vehicles  to  arrive  at  the  same destination. Likewise, having closely looked at the judgment  of  the Tribunal, especially when it observed at p.  565 of the record of appeal that "the  issue  related  to  royalty was  well  settled"  by  the  Board,  with  respect, we think the Tribunal  misconceived  the  reasoning  of the  Board.  What the Board  held,  in  our  view,  was  that the  payment  made  by  the  appellant to M/S  Siemens  Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd for purchase  of  computer software  is taxable  in  terms  of section  34  (1)  (c)  of the  Income Tax  Act,

1973, that is, as "any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property". It did not mean to refer to "royalty" which is under paragraph (b) of that version of the Income Tax Act. We think the Tribunal  used  the  2002  Revised  Edition  of the  Income  Tax  Act  while  the Board  used the Income Tax Act,  1973 as it was before the Revised  Edition of 2002. For easy reference, we reproduce the 2002 version of the Income Tax Act. It reads:

"34.  (1)  Every person  shall,  upon payment of any amount  to  any  non-resident person  not  having  a permanent establishment in  the  United Republic in respect of-

- (a) any management fee;
- (b) any professional fee  which is not a  fee for the provisions of  technical services;
- any royalty; (c)

any royalty;

- (d) any rent, premium or like consideration  for  the  use  or  occupation  of property;
- (e) any dividend;

any dividend;

- (f) any interest;
- (g) any pension or retirement annuity;
- (Ii) [Repealed by Act No. 25 of 1997 s. 28.];
- (i) business insurance claims;

- (j) the provision  of technical services  to  a person carrying on mining operations;
- (k) annual fees payable  to a  director other than a  whole time service director of a corporation for serving as a member of  the Board\ which is chargeable to tax,  deduct therefrom tax at the appropriate non-resident withholding tax rate."

[Emphasis supplied].

Thus, the "any rent, premium or like consideration for the use or occupation of property" used  by the  Board to hold that the payment made  by  the  appellant  to  M/S  Siemens Telecommunication  (Pty)  Ltd  was taxable, appears in para (d) of the 2002 Revised Edition whereas it appears in  para (c) in the  1973 version.

Be  that  as  it  may,  both  the  Board  and  the  Tribunal  arrived  at  the same conclusion  that  payment  made  by  the  appellant  to  M/S  Siemens Telecommunication  (Pty)  Ltd was taxable.  The appeal  before  us  is  against the  decision  of the  Tribunal  which  held  that  the  payment  was  taxable  as royalty  in  terms  of section  34  (1)  (c)  of the  Income Tax  Act,  Cap.  332  of the Revised Edition, 2002.

As rightly put by the Tribunal, the issue whether payment made by a person for the purchase of computer software is taxable in terms of section

34  (1)  (c)  of  the  Income  Tax  Act,  is  not  a  virgin  territory;  it  has  been traversed  before.  In Celtel  Tanzania  Ltd (supra),  referred  to  us  by  the respondent and  whose facts are in  all  fours with  the facts  in  the  case the subject of the appeal  at hand, we were confronted with a similar scenario. In Celtel Tanzania Ltd, like in the present, the appellant, Celtel Tanzania Limited, currently known as Airtel Tanzania Limited, made two payments to two  foreign  companies,  Alcatel  France  and  Ericsson  AB  for  purchase  of software and software licence at an amount not relevant for the determination  of this  appeal. In  2008,  Tanzania  Revenue Authority,  after conducting  a  tax  audit  in respect  of  the  appellant's  accounts  for  the relevant years  in  which  the  above  payments were  made,  demanded, inter alia ,   Tshs.  217,905,341/=  as withholding  tax  in  the form  of royalty arising from the payments made to the two foreign companies for the purchase of the software and  software  licence. The appellant objected to the demand on the ground that the payments did not constitute royalty.  We subscribed to the position taken by the Court of Appeal of Kenya in Kenya Commercial Bank Limited (supra) in which it was held that payment for the  right to  use  a  computer  software  constitutes  royalty.  At  p.  26  of the judgment, we recited the following excerpt from the Kenyan case;

" . . . the  agreement  between  the  parties  was  for grant  of  a  licence  to the  bank  to use  Infosys computer software program and for provision of other services.  The agreement specifically provided, inter alia that Infosys would at all times retain all title, copyright  and other  proprietary rights in software and that the bank  would not acquire any rights other than  those specified in  the agreement ....   It is plain from the agreement that the payment of licence fees was a consideration for the right to use  Infosys  intellectual  property  in  the  form  of computer  software  program  which  is  within  the definition of royalty under clause (c) of S.  2 of the Act."

We subscribed  to  the  position  taken  in  our  neighbouring  jurisdiction in Kenya  Commercial  Bank  Limited (supra)  as  depicting  the  correct position of the law in our jurisdiction as well.

In  our another decision of National  Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited (supra) we took the same view that payment for software and to use the software  is a  royalty and  therefore subject to withholding tax.  We observed at p.  19 of the typed judgment:

". . . what was transferred to the appellants is only a licence to use the software which was  to be

supplied by  Neptune under  certain terms  and conditions.  To that extent , on a proper construction , we do not entertain a flicker of doubt that the SLA constituted a lease within the definition of the term under section 3 of the TTA,  2004.  Likewise,  we are just as  well fully satisfied that the payment of the licence fees was a consideration for the right to use software which is within the definition of  a  "royalty' under clause (a) of its definition under section 3 of the TTA, 2004."

In  the  case  the  subject of this  appeal,  the "Agreement for  Purchase and  Sale"  between  the  appellant  and  M/S  Siemens  Telecommunications (Pty) Ltd stipulates at clause 2.2 thereof appearing at p.  53 of the record of appeal reads:

"2.2 The Purchaser shall have the option to renew this  Contract  for  such  further  periods  as  it may require from time to time,  until the expiry of its  License,  provided  that  the  Purchaser shall give  written  notice  to  the  Seller  o f its intention  to  exercise  such  option  not  later than 3 months prior to the expiry o f  the initial period or any extension  thereof,  as the  case may be."

What  we  discern  from  the  above  clause  is  that  the  appellant  was accorded the  right to  use the software. That right was  non-exclusive and non-transferable.  That,  in  our  view,  is  a  hallmark  of a  royalty  subject  to withholding  tax and  the Tribunal  was justified  to so  hold.  And,  as if clinch the matter, the clause is similar with such clauses in Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra)  and National  Microfinance  Bank  Tanzania  Limited (supra). Guided  by  the  position  we  took  in Celtel  Tanzania  Ltd (supra)  and National  Microfinance Bank Tanzania Limited (supra), we do not see any  legal  justification  to  depart from  that  position.  We  are  not  persuaded by the argument advanced by Dr.  Nyika that Celtel Tanzania Ltd (supra) is  distinguishable,  for  the  obvious  reason  that  we  took  the  same  view  in National  Microfinance  Bank  Tanzania  Limited (supra)  without  even referring  to Celtel  Tanzania  Ltd (supra)  which  Dr.  Nyika  would  have  us hold is distinguishable. We are of the settled view in our mind that the two cases depict a  correct  position  of the  law  in  this jurisdiction  and  thus  see no sound  legal  reason  why we  should  depart from  that sound  standpoint. In the premises, we find and  hold that the payment made by the appellant to  M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd for the purchase of computer software was in the nature of, and is taxable as,  royalty in terms of section 34  (1)  (c)  of the  Income Tax,  Cap.  332  of the  Revised  Edition,  2002.  The

Tribunal  rightly  so  held.  We  find  no  legal  justification  to  meddle  with  its decision. The three grounds of appeal, that is grounds  1 , 3 and 4 therefore collapse.

Next  for  consideration  is  ground  2  which  seeks  to  challenge  the Tribunal  for  holding  that  the  Board  had  determined  and  well  settled  that the payment by the appellant to M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd constituted a  royalty. The determination of this issue should  not detain  us, for  we  have  partly  discussed  it  when  considering  grounds  1 ,  3  and  4 above.  We  have  made  ourselves  clear  that  the  Board  found  that  the payment under reference fell  within  the scope of section  34  (1)  (c)  of the Income Tax Act,  1973; "any rent,  premium  or like consideration for the  use  or  occupation  of  property". It  did  not  determine  it  as  falling under section  34 (1)  (b) of the Income Tax Act,  1973; "any royalty". For clarity we will  let the Board speak for itself through  p.  369 of the record of appeal:

"The  respondent  insists  that  the  payment  on  the purchase  of the  software  constitutes  a  royalty  .... This honourable Board by looking at section 2 of  the same Act [the Income Tax Act,  1973] which defines the  word royalty,  it goes  without saying  that  the purchase of software does not constitute a royalty.

For a payment to qualify as a royalty the asset for which usage is paid has to be copyrighted which is not the case in this instant appeal."

Then the Board analysed the contents of clause  16 of the Agreement and went on:

"... the Honorable Board still has the findings that the payments amount to a license fees as he  was given  royalty free  license  by the Seller. Therefore, the  payment made  by  the  appellant  to  the  seller does  not  constitute  a  royalty  as  alleged  by  the respondent."

In  view  of the  above,  it  is  our  considered  opinion  that  the  Tribunal slipped into error when it stated at p.  565 of the record of appeal that "it is obvious  that  the  issue relating to royalty  was  well settled"; that  the payment  by  the  appellant  to  M/S  Siemens  Telecommunication  (Pty)  Ltd constituted  royalty.  On the contrary,  as we  have already stated,  the  Board did  not find  the  payment under reference to constitute  royalty but to be a consideration for the use of the property of M/S Siemens Telecommunication (Pty) Ltd. We have already explained the source of the confusion as being brought about by using different versions of the Income Tax  Act.  There  is  merit  in  this  complaint  in  the  second  ground  of appeal and we so find.

The  last ground  of appeal  seeks to fault the Tribunal  that  it did  not strictly  interpret  a  taxing  provision,  which  was  contrary  to  the  cardinal principle  governing  taxing  statutes.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant argued  that  the  Tribunal  ought  to  have  interpreted  the  word  "royalty" without according  to  it an  adulterated  meaning.  On  strict interpretation  of taxing  statutes,  counsel  referred  us  to  the  principle  enunciated  in Cape Brandy Syndicate v. Inland  Revenue Commissioner [1921]  1   KB  64, wherein it was held at page 71:

"In a  taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said.  There is no room  for any intendment. There is no equity about tax. There is no presumption as to tax.  Nothing is to be read in and nothing to be implied."

On the other hand, the  respondent argued that the Tribunal  did  not offend any principle of interpretation of taxing statutes.

We  have  read  the judgment of the Tribunal  and  fail  to  comprehend the  appellant's  complaint  in  this  regard.  As  we  have  stated  above  when considering grounds  1 ,  3 and 4 of the grounds of appeal, the Tribunal well interpreted the statutes under consideration. We do  not see any intendment, presumption, equity nor  interpolation on the  part  of the Tribunal. If anything,  the  Tribunal  looked  at the statute  as  clearly said  by

the  relevant  provisions.  We  find  this  ground  of  appeal  lacking  merit  and dismiss it.

For  reasons that we  have endeavoured to assign  above  in  which  we have found all grounds of appeal, except the second, as lacking substance, this appeal is,  ultimately, wanting in merit. It stands dismissed with costs.
