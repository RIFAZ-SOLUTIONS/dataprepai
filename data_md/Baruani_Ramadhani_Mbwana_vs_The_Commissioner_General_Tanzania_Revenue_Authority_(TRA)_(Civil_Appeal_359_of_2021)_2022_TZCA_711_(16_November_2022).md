## RULING OF THE COURT

26t h  October &amp; 16t h  November,  2022

## MAKUNGU. J.A.:

The appellant, Baruani Ramadhani Mbwana, is challenging the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 23r d  October, 2018 which sustained the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board).

From what can be discerned in the record before us, the background to the  present appeal  is  briefly as follows: the  appellant  is  a  Tanzanian national residing and doing transportation business in Tanzania, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo.

On 20t h  December, 2014 the appellant imported [temporarily] a motor vehicle with registration No. 7584 AB 19 Scania registered in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a trailer with registration No. R.L. 0317 registered in Rwanda through the customs frontier port at Kabanga. He was issued with form C32.

On 7t h  July,  2015 the appellant was intercepted  by the respondent's officers at Kasulu, Kigoma while heading to Nyarugusu 29 kilometers before reaching Mabamba customs frontier port on allegation that he had violated customs laws hence he was returned to Kigoma where his motor vehicle was put in customs warehouse and he was issued with notice of goods deposited in customs warehouse number 36474 and 36475 dated 7t h  July, 2015.

The  appellant  applied  to  the  Commissioner  for  extension  of  the temporary  importation  permit  and  release  of  his  motor  vehicle. There followed exchange of communications between the appellant's attorneys and the respondent without success.  On 7t h  October, 2015 the respondent gave her final  decision  on  the  matter  refusing  to  release the appellant's  motor vehicle on the ground that it had overstayed.  The appellant appealed to the Board which dismissed his appeal.

Undaunted,  the  appellant  unsuccessfully  lodged  an  appeal  to  the Tribunal which sustained the decision of the Board and this is what made the appellant to lodge the present appeal.

The appellant's dissatisfaction is vividly demonstrated  by six grounds of appeal contained in the memorandum of appeal.  However, for the reason which  shall  come  to  light  shortly,  we  do  not  intend  to  reproduce  the respective grounds of appeal herein.

The appeal was initially called on for hearing on 24t h  October, 2022 in the presence of the appellant in person, unrepresented and Messrs.  Marcel Busegano  and  Hospis  Maswanyia,  learned  Senior  State  Attorneys  for the respondent.

At the very outset, before we commenced the hearing of the appeal, we wanted to satisfy ourselves on the competence of the appeal before us. Thus, we invited the parties to address first.

In addressing on the question which was raised by the Court that the certificate of delay was not included  in the record of appeal, the appellant informed the Court that he followed all the procedures regarding the filing of  his  appeal. He  further  told  the  Court  that this  Court  allowed  him   to proceed with  his appeal  after it had granted  leave to amend  his  notice of

appeal.  He believed that the appeal is competent before the Court and urged us to proceed with the hearing of the appeal.

On his part,  Mr.  Maswanyia submitted that having gone through the record  of  appeal  there  is  no  indication  that  the  appellant  received  the certificate of delay from the Registrar of the Tribunal before he lodged the instant appeal.  He explained that the decision of the Tribunal was issued on 23r d   October,  2018 and the  notice of appeal  was  lodged  on  29t h  October, 2018 but the memorandum of appeal was filed on  12t h  October, 2021. He went further to submit that in terms of Rule 90 (1) and (2) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules, 2009 (the Rules), the appellant was not entitled to rely upon the exemption of time if the certificate of delay was not  obtained.

In the circumstances, the learned Senior State Attorney submitted that as  there  is  no  certificate  of  delay  that  was  sought  and  obtained  by  the appellant, the appeal is incompetent.  He concluded his submission by urging the Court to strike out the appeal.

Having heard the learned Senior State Attorney for the respondent and the appellant, there is no doubt that the instant appeal  is incompetent for being lodged out of time.

Our starting point would be restating what the law provides in relation to the institution of the appeal and certificate of delay. Rule 90 (1) of the Rules, provides as follows:

"(1) Subject to the  provisions of  Rule 128, an appeal shall  be  instituted  by  lodging  in  the  appropriate registry, within  sixty days  of the  date  when notice of  appeal was fodged with -

- (a) a memorandum of  appeal in quintuplicate;
- (b) the record of  appeal in quintuplicate;
- (c) security for costs of  the appeal.

Save that where an application fora copy of  the proceedings in the High Court has been made within thirty days of the date of the decision against which it is desired to appeal,  there shall in computing the time within which the appeal is to be instituted  be excluded such  time  as  may be certified by the Registrar of  the High Court as having been required for the preparation and delivery of  that copy  to the appellant." (emphasis added).

It is instructive to recapitulate that the provisions of Rule 90 (1) of the Rules as cited above makes it mandatory for the appellant to lodge a record of appeal as well as memorandum of appeal within sixty days of filing of the notice of appeal. However, that requirement is subject to the proviso for

exemption of time required for seeking and obtaining from the High Court a copy of the proceeding from that Court as may be certified by the Registrar where an application for such copy is made within thirty days of the delivery of the decision sought to be challenged.

There is no dispute that the appellant was aggrieved by the Tribunal's decision and decree dated 23r d  October, 2018.  As already indicated herein, he lodged a notice of appeal on 29t h  October, 2018 and the record of appeal shows that he received copies of proceedings, judgment and decree on 19t h November, 2018 (at page 50 of the record of appeal).  This means that he received the necessary documents for purposes of appeal twenty seven (27) days from the date of judgment and twenty one (21) days from the date of notice of appeal. He was supposed to institute his appeal within sixty days after lodging the notice of appeal. The appeal was supposed to be lodged on or before 29t h  December, 2018.  Unfortunately, however, the appeal was lodged on  12t h  October, 2021, inordinate delay of three (3) years. Our view is that the appellant was not entitled to be issued with the certificate of delay but  he  was  required  to  seek for  extension  of time which  he  did  not do, instead he lodged a Civil Application No. 573/20 of 2018 for leave to amend

notice of appeal which on 18t h  August, 2021 was granted by this Court.  The said leave has nothing to do with the lodging of appeal out of time.

Given  the  circumstances  obtained  in  this  appeal  therefore,  we  are settled that the appeal before us is incompetent for being time barred.  We accordingly strike it out. We order each party to bear its own costs, since the point was raised by the Court, suo motu. It is so ordered.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 14t h  day of November, 2022.
