## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

20'"  &amp; 29th  October, 2021

## MAIGE, 3.A.:

Until 2008, income tax  in Tanzania Mainland was chargeable for each year of income to every person who earned total  income for a year of income or he who received a final withholding payment during the year of income.  Unrelieved  loss of the  year of income  and  of a previous year of income was, under section  19(1)  (a) and  (b) of the Income Tax Act of 2004  (the Act),  deducted  in  calculating  income without  any  discrimination.  In  2008,  section  4(1)  of  the  Act  was amended  by  the  Finance  Act  No.  13  of  2008  so  as  to  introduce alternative minimum tax (the AMT) in respect of a corporation which has a  perpetual  unrelieved  loss for the year of income  and  previous two years of income attributable to tax  incentives.  In  2012,  the Act was further amended, by the Finance Act No. 8 of 2012, with the effect of among others, omitting the phrase "attributable to tax incentives" in  the respective provision. The equity behind the introduction of the AMT, it would appear to us, was to reduce the possibility of business establishments avoiding income tax payment by using tax preferences available  under the  regular tax system. The main question that we are called upon to determine in this appeal is whether the respondent rightly applied these  two  amendments  in  imposing  AMT  to  the appellant in respect of her unrelieved perpetual loss for 2012 and 2013 years of income.

The appellant, it is undeniable, is a strategic investor in terms of the  Tanzania  Investment  Act, 1997  and  is,  on  that  account, in possession  of  a  Certificate  of  Incentive  No.  060031  issued  by  the Tanzania Investment Centre (the TIC) on 24t h  May, 2001 under section 17 of the Tanzania Investment Act. It is equally irrefutable that, under the respective certificate, the appellant which was operating a chain of

retail stores in Arusha and Dar Es Salaam, enjoyed special incentives on import duties, withholding taxes and eligibility of capital allowances. Further not in dispute is the fact that, the appellant though utilized the tax  incentives  in  the  initial  two  years  of  investment,  she  did  not, throughout the  period  of her operation,  declare any  profit.  As  such, the appellant had been a loss-making business establishment from her inception to the closure of her business.

In 2014, the respondent, having conducted a tax audit in respect of  2012  and  2013  years  of  income,  made  assessments  number  F. 13730 for 2012 and F.  13731 for 2013 and subjected the appellant to AMT at the rate of 0.3% on her turnovers for the respective years of income.  Aggrieved,  the  appellant  preferred  objections  against  the aforesaid  assessments on  the  common  ground  that,  her  perpetual unrelieved loss in the respective years of income was not attributable to  tax  incentive  but  normal  operational  loss.  The  objections  were refused  and  the  appellant  preferred  appeals  to  the Tax  Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) against each of the decisions.

In  the  Tax  Appeal Nos. 133  and  136  of  2016,  the  Board consolidated the two  appeals  and  framed  two main issues  for

determination  namely; whether the respondent's decision to subject the appellant to AMT was correct in law and whether the imposition of interest on the assessed tax was correct in law. In respect of the first issue,  the  Board  was  of the  opinion  that,  since  losses  are  ordinarily cumulative  and  always  hard  to  demarcate  a  line  for  causes  of the same, and, in so far as there was no profit for the whole period of the investment, the AMT was  rightly imposed. Justifying  its finding,  the Board observed as follows:-

"Our finding is based on the fact thatwhereas the  certificate provided special incentives  on import duties,  withholding taxes and eligibility of  capital allowances, no evidence was adduced on part of the appellant that she did not utilize the incentives, or that she paid the taxes  referred  to in condition 12  of  the certificate. We  neither  received  evidence  of failure  to  commence  implementation  within two years of the grant of the certificate  that would  have  invalidated  the  certificate. The appellant was duty bound to report her failure to operate the investment to Tanzania Investment Centre if at all there  was such a failure. The  appellant  never  reported. That

## goes  to  negate  the  appellant's  argument of nonuse of  the certificate of  incentive".

On the second issue, the Board took the view that, in as long as the imposition of the AMT was correct, the decision to impose interest on the assessed amount was equally correct.  The consolidated appeal was henceforth dismissed.

Once  again  displeased,  the  appellant  appealed  to  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) on three grounds. One, the Board  erred  in  law  and  fact  in  holding  that  in  circumstances  where there was no profit for the whole period of the investment, it was right for the appellant to be subjected to alternative minimum tax. Two, the Board erred  in  law  and  facts  in  holding  that,  the  appellant failed  to adduce evidence that she  paid  taxes  referred  in  condition  12 of the certificate. Three, the Board erred in law and fact in holding that the imposition of interest by the respondent was correct in law.

In  its  reasoned decision, the Tribunal was of the view that, the undisputed appellant's perpetual unrelieved loss throughout  her business operation  was attributable to tax incentives.  In  reaching to such a conclusion, the  Tribunal  considered the fact that, despite being

a  loss-making company from 2001 when she procured the certificate of incentives until the closure of her businesses, the appellant did not adduce  any  evidence  demarcating  between  loss  attributable  to  tax incentives  and  that  which  was  not.  Neither  did  she  adduce any evidence of non-utilization  of the  incentives or failure to commence implementation of the investment within two years. In its own words, the Tribunal  observed as follows:-

"Therefore in the absence of  such certification, it  proves  that  the  Appellant  enjoyed  investment incentives as  the  certificate  was  operational and  the  Appellant  as the holder  of  the certificate must  pay tax  accordingly. Moreover, in the absence of evidence to separate losses that were caused by incentives or not before July  2012, there is no way  that the Respondent and  later  the  Board  could  exonerate  the Appellant from the disputed tax liability.  Thus the  Board  was  correct  in  holding  that  the Appellant failed to adduce evidence that she did not utilize the incentives or that she paid taxes referred  in condition 12  of  the certificate"

On the issue of interest, it was the opinion of the Tribunal that, the respondent correctly imposed the same pursuant to section 101(1), (2) and  (3)  of the Act. The Tribunal, therefore, dismissed the appeal and  upheld  the decision  of the  Board  and  hence  the  instant appeal wherein  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal  is  faulted  on  the  following grounds:-

- 1.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in  law in  failure  to address the issue whether the Board was correct in holding that the Respondent's decision to subject the Appellant to alternative minimum  tax which was  one  of  the issues framed  for determination.
- 2.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the Appellant was supposed to separate the losses and prove beyond  reasonable doubt that  he had utilized  tax  incentive or  not as required by section 18 (2) (b) of the  Tax Revenue Appeals Art â–  Cap. 408.
- 3.  The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the appellant was supposed to bring evidence on deductions on import  duties, withholding  taxes, and  eligibility  of  capital allowances and  on capital  expenditures of  a plant  and  machinery incurred in the respective year of  income for it to be exonerated from being subjected to alternative minimum tax under Income Tax Act, 2004.

- 4.  The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in iaw by holding that the Board was correct  in its  holding that  the  Respondent  correctly subjected the appellant to alternative minimum tax because the appellant failed to provide evidence that she did not utilize tax incentive or that she paid taxes referred under the certificate of incentive.
- 5.  The Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred  in law by failing to hold that  the  Board  was  wrong  to  hold  that the  respondent  was correct to impose interest on the assessed amount

At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was represented by a team of three learned advocates namely,  Mr. Wilson  Mukebezi, Mr. Alan  Kileo  and  Mr,  Stephen Axwesso.  The  respondent  was  also represented  by a  team  of three  States Attorneys  namefy;  Mr.  Juma Kisongo,  learned  Principal  State  Attorney,  Ms.  Gloria  Achimp  ota, learned Senior State Attorney and Ms. Samia Nyakunga, learned Senior State Attorney.  In their oral submissions which for the appellant was submitted by  Mr. Axwesso and for the respondent Mr.  Kisongo, each of the parties adopted its written submissions earlier on filed with some clarifications.

In address of the first ground, Mr. Axwesso submitted in the first place that, since the amendment omitting the phrase "attributable to

tax incentives" was made in 2012, it could not operate retrospectively as to affect the loss in respect of 2012 and 2013 years of income. The basis  of  his  argument  was that,  in  accordance  with  the  relevant provision,  it is not only the turnover of the respective year of income which is taken  into account in determining liability to  pay AMT but unrelieved  loss for previous two years of income as well.  In  his view therefore, for the unrelieved  loss of 2012 and  2013 years of income, it is the turnover  of 2015's years of income which would be taxable.

In the second  place,  it was  M ir.  Axwesso's submission that, to establish that the loss was attributed to tax incentives, it was necessary for the respondent to produce empirical evidence to that effect. In his further submissions, Mr. Axwesso was of the contention that, contrary to the Tribunal's expression, there was ample evidence on the record to the effect that the loss in question resulted from other factors such as  poor sales, theft,  insufficient parking  lot for customers and wrong business cites.

The  complaint  in  the  second  ground  of  appeal  is  that,  the Tribunal  introduced  a  new  principle  of  law  when  it  held  that  the appellant had  a  burden to  prove  beyond  reasonable doubt that,  she

did not utilize tax incentives. Nonetheless, when we requested him to show where such a finding appears in the judgment of the Tribunal, Mr. Axwesso was quick to admit that the same is not in the judgment. Our  reading  of the judgment also  suggests so.  In the circumstance, the second ground of appeal is dismissed for being misplaced.

In support of the third and fourth grounds, Mr. Axwesso criticized the  Tribunal  for  determining  the matter  basing  on  an incorrect assumption  that,  once  a  holder  of a  certificate  of incentives  suffers loss,  the  same  is deemed  to  have  been  attributable  to tax  incentive unless proved otherwise.  In his understanding of the law,  the burden to establish that the unrelieved loss was attributable to tax incentives was  on  the  respondent.  The  respondent,  he  submitted,  completely failed to discharge the duty. To the contrary, he submitted further, the appellant  adduced  sufficient  evidence  to  disassociate  the  loss  in question from tax incentives.

On the fifth ground, it was his submission that, since the principal tax was wrongly imposed, interest was consequently wrongly imposed. The appellant therefore urged the Court to allow the appeal  and  set aside the judgment and decree of the tribunal.

In opposition to the first ground of appeal, it was Mr. Kisongo's submission that,  in as much as there was no proof of non-use of the tax  incentives throughout the years of her unrelieved  perpetual  loss, the appellant was properly subjected to AMT. On whether or not the 2012 amendment was applicable, it was his argument that, the same has  been  misconceived  as the  imposition  of AMT by the  respondent was based on the 2008 amendment. It was submitted further or in the alternative that if, which is not, the AMT was imposed basing on 2012 amendment, the decision of the Tribunal would remain correct because ATM was charged on the appellant's turnovers for 2012 and 2013 years of income. The unrelieved perpetual loss for the previous two years of income,  he submitted, was only the precondition for the imposition of the same.

On  whether the  respondent was  required  to  adduce  empirical evidence to establish that the loss was attributed to tax  incentive,  it was his submission that, the same was a pure factual issue which did not qualify as a  ground of appeal  at this  level. In  the  alternative,  it was submitted that, under the express provision of section  18 (2) (b) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, [ Cap. 408 R.E. 2019] the burden of

proof lies on the appellant. In the further alternative, it was submitted that,  the  issue  cannot  be  relevant  because  it  is  being  raised  for the first time in this appeal.

On the fifth  ground,  it  was the  submission  for the  respondent that,  since the  imposition of AMT was correct, the charge of interest was in the same way correct.  Finally, the counsel  urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  his rejoinder submission, Mr. Axwesso did not raise any new issue apart from reiterating his submissions in chief.

We have taken time to carefully study the rival submissions and examine the record. With all respects to the counsel for the appellant, we are of the view that this appeal  is devoid of any  merit.  We shall rationalize our opinion gradually as we go on.

The  subjects  of this  appeal  are  tax  assessments  numbers  F. 13730  for year  2012  and  F.  13731  for  the  year  2013.  These were apparently made under section 4 (1) (a) of the Act as amended by the Finance Act No.  13 of 2008 which provides as foliows:-

"4-(1)  Income  tax  shall  be  charged  and  is payable for each year of  income in accordance with the  procedure in Part VII  by  everyperson-

- (a) Who  has  total income  for  the  year of income or is a corporation  which has a perpetual unrelieved  loss determined under section 19 for the year of  income and the previous two consecutive years of  income attributable to tax incentives."

For  a  corporation  to  be  subjected  to  AMT  under  the  above provision, two conditions must be established. First, the unrelieved loss must have been accumulated for three consecutive years of income. Two,  the  said  loss  must  be  attributable  to  tax  incentives.  We  have noted  from  the  record  that,  whether  the  first  condition  has  been established  has  never  been  doubted.  Neither  has  there  been  any dispute that, the appellant has since her inception been the holder of a certificate of incentives in terms of the Tanzania Investment Act. The line of contention is whether the unrelieved loss in the respective years of income  was attributable to tax incentives.

As apparently revealed in the record, the appellant was subjected to AMT because despite enjoying tax incentives in the initial years of her investments,  she  had accumulated  unrelieved  loss for the whole period of her business operation. The respondent maintained the same position  in  its  decision  refusing  the  objection.  Just as  it was  for the

Board,  the  tribunal,  in  its  decision, was  of the  considered  opinion that,  in  the  absence of concrete evidence demarcating  between  loss attributed to tax incentive and that which is  attributed by other factors, it cannot be said that the appellant has  proved that the same was not attributable to tax incentives. The appellant complains in the first and third grounds that, it was the respondent who was required to adduce empirical evidence that the loss was attributable to tax incentives.  In our considered view the appellant is quite wrong because in accordance with  section  18(2)  (b) of the Tax Appeals Tribunals' Act, the burden of proof in tax matters lies on the tax-payer. The equity behind  the  law  was  explained  in  details in  the  case  of Insiginia Limited  vs.  The  Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  14 of 2007 (unreported)  in the following words:-

The burden of  proof in tax matters has often been placed on the  tax-payer. This indicates how critical the burden rule is,  and reflects several competing rationales: the vital interest  of  the  government  in  getting  its revenues; the tax  payer  has easy access to the relevant  information  and  the  importance  of

encouraging  voluntary  compliance  by giving tax-payers incentives to self-report  and  to keep adequate records in case of disputes". [Emphasis added)

In this case, the appellant though does not dispute the fact that she was in  possession of a certificate of incentives and that she had utilized the tax incentives at least in the initial years of her investment, she  did  not  adduce  any  evidence  that  during  the  entire  life  of  her business operation, she either ceased using the incentives or paid the taxes referred to in condition 12 of the certificate. Considering the fact that the unrelieved loss was perpetual from the inception to the closure of the business, evidence of non-use of the tax incentive or payment of the relevant taxes, was inevitable in drawing a line of demarcation between  loss  attributable  to  the  incentives  and  that attributable  to other factors.  We do  not think that,  in taking  such  an  approach,  the two Board and the Tribunal misdirected themselves on any principle of law.

There was yet a complaint that because the amendment deleting the words "attributable to tax incentives" came into operation in July 2012,  it could  not  retrospectively operate  as to cover the  loss  under

discussion. The contention appears to have been misplaced since the tax  in  question  was  imposed  under  section  4(1)  (a)  of  the  2008 amendment.

In view of the foregoing discussions therefore, the first and third grounds of appeal are devoid of any substance and they are henceforth dismissed.

The correctness of the concurrent decision of the Board and the Tribunal  on the attribution  between the loss and  incentives was also questioned in the fourth ground of appeal. In the view of the counsel for the appellant, there was  both oral and documentary evidence on the record to establish that the  loss in question was  related to other factors. Whether the Tribunal was right in holding that the appellant failed  to  prove  connection  between  the  loss and  tax  incentive  is,  as rightly submitted for the respondent, a pure point of  fact. In accordance with section 25(2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap. 408, R.E., 2019, (the TRAA),  the decision of the Tribunal on that issue was final and conclusive. It could  not be open for a further appeal to the Court. Therefore, in Bulyanhulu  Gold  Mine  Limited  vs. Commissioner General,  TiRA, Consolidated  Civil  Appeals  Nos.  89

and 90 of 2015 (unreported), this Court made  the  following pronouncement which we entirely associate with:-

"We agree  with  the  Tribunal that this was a question of fact  In terms of  section 18(2) of the  Tax Revenue Appeals Act,  the burden of proof was on the Appellant to prove that the said equipment were used wholly and exclusively for purposes of  mining operations. In the finding of  the Tribunal, the  Appellant  had failed to discharge that burden.  This being a question of  fact, it ends there.  This is because section 25(2) of  the Tax Revenue Appeals Act (Cap 408 R.E.  2002) appeals to this Court He only on matters involving questions of  taw. So, we  find  that  the  fifth  ground  is  devoid  of substance and we dismiss it"

Applying the above principle therefore, we hold that, since under section 25 (2) of the TRAA appeals to this Court lie only on  points of law,  the  finding  of  the  Tribunal  under  discussion  in  so  far  as  it constitutes a pure point of fact, cannot be a subject of appeal to this Court.  The fourth ground of appeal is thus dismissed.

The  contention  by  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  on  the  fifth ground was based on the presupposition that, the imposition AMT was

incorrect. With  rejection  of  the presupposition in our  first  four grounds, the fifth ground of appeal  remains with  no leg on which to stand. It is consequently dismissed.

In  the  final  result,  the  appeal  is  dismissed  in  its  entirety  with costs.
