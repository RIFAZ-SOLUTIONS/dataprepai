## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

18th   July &amp; 22n d  September, 2022

## WAMBALI. JA.:

The  appellant,  Commissioner  General  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority, issued to the respondent, Geita Gold Mining Limited a demand notice dated 23r d  September, 2013 for payment of TZS. 1,208,568,508.00 for the months

of July and August, being excise duty and fuel levy on gasoil fuel consumed by persons other than the respondent.  It is on record that initially the said demand notice was not received by the respondent.

In the premises, on  7t h  August,  2017 the appellant re-sent the same demand notice to the respondent. Upon receipt of the said demand notice the  respondent instructed  its bank,  Ms.  ECO BANK TANZANIA LIMITED to transfer the demanded sum, that is, TZS. 1,208,568,508.00 from its account number 0040015401701406 to the appellant's account held with the Bank of Tanzania.

On 22n d  August, 2017 the respondent notified the appellant concerning the  payment. However,  later the  respondent noted  that through  a  letter dated 17t h  July, 2017, the appellant had informed the respondent that after the said  demanded  payment was delayed, she deducted the amount from her Escrow Deposit Account.  It was further revealed through that letter the appellant also deducted from the said account TZS. 1,470,620,536.00 being settlement of the demand notice dated 29th April, 2014. In the circumstances,  the appellant notified  the  respondent that since the stated transactions amounted to double payment, it was advisable to lodge a formal application for refund of TZS.  1,470.620.536.00 which was paid twice.

Noteworthy, on her letter dated 22n d  August, 2017 the respondent had notified the appellant that the payment of TZS. 1,208,568,508.00 was made under protest arguing that the recovery of TZS.  1,470,620,536.00 from her Escrow Deposit Account was unjustified and amounted to double taxation. She thus demanded an immediate refund.  That letter was not replied by the appellant.  As a result, the respondent lodged Custom and Excise Tax Appeal No.  18  of 2017  at the Tax  Revenue Appeals  Board  (the TRAB)  at  Dar es Salaam.

The grounds of appeals before the TRAB were: one, that the appellant erred in fact and law for demanding cash deposit of TZS.  1,208,568,508.00 while  she  had  already  recovered  the  amount  from  her  Escrow  Deposit Account. Two, that the appellant erred in law by refusing to offset the unpaid amount  against  the  double  payment. Three,  that  the  appellant  acted contrary to the law by disregarding the settled  position that she is entitled from claiming remission of excise duty and fuel  levy that she enjoys under the  law  by  requesting  her  to  pay  the  demanded  tax  and  then  apply for refund.  Four, that the appellant acted contrary to the law to demand double taxation from the respondent.

Ultimately, the respondent prayed the TRAB to direct the appellant to offset the demanded amount against the amount already recovered from her

Escrow  Deposit Account  and  to  refund  the  amount  that  was  paid  under protest.  The said appeal was strongly contested by the appellant who prayed that the same should  be dismissed and the respondent be ordered to pay the excise duty and fuel levy previously demanded by her.

The TRAB  heard  arguments  by the  parties  and  in  the  end,  it decided in favour of the respondent.  Particularly, it ordered the appellant to offset  the  demanded  amount  already  recovered  from  the  respondent's Escrow  Deposit  Account  which  is  TZS.  1,470,620,536.00  and  refund  the amount that was paid under protest by the sum of TZS.  1,208,568,508.00. Apparently, though the appellant admitted that the  respondent paid TZS. 1.208.568.508.00 on  11th  August, 2017 as outstanding excise duty and fuel levy for the diverted fuel as per the demand notice dated 23r d  September, 2013,  she  maintained  that  she  could  not  offset  that  amount  from  TZS. 1.470.620.536.00 as the two amounts were distinct and the procedure for claiming refund of duplicated or overpaid taxes required the respondent to make a formal application as the law does not allow offsetting of figures in two distinct transactions. Therefore, the appellant strongly emphasized that the said amount paid by the respondent was legally justified and that it did not amount to double taxation.

Aggrieved  by that decision,  the appellant unsuccessfully appealed to the Tax  Revenue Appeal Tribunal (the TRAT) in Appeal  No.  24 of 2020 as the decision of the TRAB was upheld, hence the present appeal premised on the following grounds:

- "1.  That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by wrongly construing the Provisions of  section 71  (1) and (2) of the tax Administration Act (Cap. 438),  which provided for proper procedure for the taxpayer to apply  for  refund  of  any  tax  paid  in excess to the Commissioner General.
- 2.  That,  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the appellant should refund the amount that was settled and which was paid under protest in  the absence  of a  formal application  for refund to the Commissioner as required by law.
- 3.  That the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the Board was correct when it held that the appellant should offset the demanded tax  amount  against  the amount  already  appropriated from the respondents escrow deposit account".

However,  during  the  hearing  of the appeal  before  us,  Mr.  Moses  Kinabo, learned Senior State Attorney who appeared for the appellant, acknowledged and conceded to the fact that the crucial  matter in determining the appeal revolves around the complaint in the first ground.  He therefore compressed the three grounds into one.

Submitting  in  support of the  appeal,  Mr.  Kinabo contended  that the decision of the TRAT is legally wrong  because it did  not conform with the requirement of the law. He argued that by confirming the decision of the TRAB,  the  TRAT  utterly  disregarded  and  misconstrued  the  provisions  of section  71  (1)  and  (2)  of the Tax Administration Act  [Cap 438  R.E.  2022] ("Cap. 438") which sets the procedure and requirement for a taxpayer who claims refund for the amount of money paid in excess or double payment to apply formally to the Commissioner General within the prescribed time.  He argued further that though the appellant does not dispute the fact that the respondent had paid the demanded amount of TZS.  1,208,568,580.00 and that TZS.  1,470,620,596.00 had also been deducted from the respondent's Escrow  Deposit  Account  in  which  the  earlier  demanded  amount  was inclusive,  the  truth  remains  that  the  tax  was  paid  in  excess  to  bring  the provisions of section 71 (1) and (2) into play.  In essence, he submitted that following the excess payment, the respondent was bound to comply with the requirement therein by applying to the Commissioner General for refund.  He added that it was in compliance with that provisions that according to exhibit A-3  contained  in  the  record  of  appeal,  initially  the  respondent  made  an attempt to apply for refund of  T7S. 1,470,620,596.00 from the Commissioner General on 12t h  July, 2018, but it was not completed on account of not being supported by tax calculations and documentary evidence as required by the law.

He added that though there is no evidence that the respondent also attempted to apply for the refund of TZS. 1,208,568,580.00, there is no way that the claimed money could be offset or refunded automatically as ordered by the TRAB and  confirmed  by the TRAT. This is so  because,  he argued, there  is  no  law  which  authorizes the  Commissioner  General  to  offset the payment  as  his  power  is  only  to  refund  the  excess  payment  of  tax  as provided under section 71 (1) and (2) of Cap. 438 upon application by the taxpayer showing correct calculations supported by documentary evidence.

Besides,  he  argued,  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  collected  the claimed  tax  in  excess  cannot  be  a  guarantee  for  an  aggrieved  party  to disregard the clear provisions of the law requiring her to apply for refund by substantiating his claim with credible evidence.

The learned Senior State Attorney therefore submitted that in view of the clear provisions of section 71 (1) and (2) of Cap 438, the TRAT wrongly confirmed the finding and order of the TRAB that required the appellant to offset the demanded tax amount against the already appropriated amount from the respondent's  Escrow  Deposit Account in the absence of a formal application for refund by the respondent to the appellant. He emphasized that it is settled law that tax statutes should be strictly interpreted, citing the decision  of  the  Court  in Commissioner  General  Tanzania  Revenue Authority v. Ecolab East African (Tanzania) Limited, Civil Appeal No. 35  of  2020  (unreported). In  the  premises,  he  urged  us  to  construe the provisions of section 71 (1) and (2) of Cap. 438 strictly and thereby reverse the  TRAT's  decision  and  hold  that  the  respondent  is  bound  to  apply  for refund  because it is legally improper for the appellant to proceed to offset the  overpaid  tax contrary to  the  requirement of the  law.  In  the  end,  Mr. Kinabo pressed us to allow the appeal with costs.

In response, Ms. Jackline Kapinga, learned advocate who appeared for the respondent, contested Mr. Kinabo's submissions and fully supported the decision of the TRAT. She argued that the complaint of the respondent at the TRAB, whose decision was confirmed by the TRAT on appeal, was not about tax paid in excess or erroneously paid as contended by the appellant's

counsel, to necessitate the application of the provisions of section 71 (1) and (2)  of Cap.  438. On  the  contrary,  she  argued,  the  appropriation  of the respondent's money amounted to double payment of tax which is contrary to the law.  In her submission, as correctly found by the TRAB and confirmed by the TRAT, the said  money was illegally taken  despite the fact that the demanded amount had been correctly paid by the respondent.

In this regard, she argued that the provisions of section 71 (1) and (2) of Cap. 438 cannot be invoked by the respondent to apply for refund to the Commissioner General as it only applies where the demanded tax is paid in excess, which  is not the case, in the appeal at hand. She maintained that as per the evidence on  record, the  respondent paid the demanded tax by the appellant which  was,  TZS.  1,208,568,508.00  and  thus  the amount of TZS.  1,470,620,536.00  which  the  appellant  admits  to  have  appropriated from the Escrow Deposit Account cannot amount to excess payment as they were illegally taken without initial notice.

Ms. Kapinga therefore submitted that the provisions of section 71 (1) and (2) of Cap. 438 should be interpreted by its plain meaning with regard to tax paid in excess which does not include double payment as contended by Mr.  Kinabo. More importantly, she argued, the decision of the Court in Ecolab  East  African (Tanzania) Limited (supra) referred by the

appellant's counsel to support his submission is distinguishable with the facts of the appeal at hand. She asserted that the facts in that appeal related to the dispute on Value Added Tax (VAT) claim and that the language used in the respective provisions under consideration is quite different with the one used under the provisions of section 71 (1) and (2) of Cap. 438.

In  the  circumstances,  she  strongly  submitted  that  the  respondent cannot be forced to apply for refund under the said provisions because her claim  is  not  based  on  the  amount  of tax  paid  in  excess  but  on  illegally appropriated  money. In  the event,  she implored  the  Court to  uphold the decision of the TRAT and dismiss the appeal with costs.

We have carefully heard the submissions of the counsel for the parties and  thoroughly scrutinized  the  materials  in  the  record  of appeal.  We  are satisfied that though the respondent responded to the demand notice from the appellant and paid TZS. 1,208,568,508.00 through its bank account, it is equally undisputed that the appellant had collected the same amount from the  respondent's  Escrow  Deposit  Account  as  acknowledged  in  her  letter (exhibit A-3) dated 17t h  July, 2017.  It is further noted from the evidence on record that in the said account, the respondent had a total deposit of TZS. 4,685,000,000.00 from which the appellant deducted TZS. 1,208,568,508.00 and TZS.  1,470,620,536.00 respectively, which brought the balance to TZS.

2,005,810,957.00. Parties are therefore  not in dispute with  regard to the exposed facts.  However, they sharply disagree on whether the appropriated amount falls into the category of tax paid in excess to bring the provisions of section 71(1),  (2) and (3) of Cap. 438 into play. For clarity, the section provides as follows:

"71(1)  A  person  may  apply  to  the  Commissioner General for  refund  of  tax  paid  in excess.

- (2) The application for refund shall be in writing, indicating the correct tax calculation and  be supported by the documentary evidence to support the claim.

(3) An application  under this section shall,  except where a tax law  provides otherwise, be made within a period not exceeding three years from the date of payment of  tax in excess".

It is plainly clear from the provisions of subsection (1) of section 71 of Cap.  438  that  an  application  for  refund  is  for  the  "tax  paid  in  excess". Admittedly, there is no definition in the statute on the meaning of tax paid in excess. Nonetheless, it is generally acknowledged  among  other circumstances that excess payment of taxes occurs as a result of erroneous calculations/assessment rendering the tax payer to  pay excess tax against

the required tax. Moreover, according to the book on Law and Practice: A Digital eBook, found at www.taxmanagementindia.com;  excess payment of tax refers to the situation where the taxpayer has made excess payment of tax either by mistake or by inadvertence resulting in more payment of tax than due to the Government.

Considering the above stated situation in which excess payment of tax may occur, we are of the view that the facts of the case at hand do not bring the respondent's appropriated amount by the appellant into the category of tax paid in excess.

In  this  regard,  we  are  of  the  considered  view  that  where  the  tax authority  appropriates  the  taxpayer's  money  who  has  already  paid  the amount of tax as per the demand notice, as is the situation in the case at hand,  that  cannot  constitute  tax  paid in excess,  to  trigger  a  formal application for refund as envisaged  by the provisions of section 71 of Cap. 438. We hold this firm view  because a  close reading of subsection (2) of that  section  pre  supposes  that  in  the  wake  of  the  dispute  between  the taxpayer and the taxing authority with regard to tax paid in excess because of erroneous calculations/assessment, mistake or inadvertence, the applicant for the refund of the tax paid in excess must clearly indicate in the

application  the  correct  tax  calculations  and  support  it  with  the  requisite documentary evidence.

In the appeal at hand, parties are not in dispute concerning the correct tax calculations/assessment of the tax which was paid by the respondent at all. There is also no contention that the respondent paid the tax by mistake or  inadvertence.  The  dispute  is  whether  despite  the  settlement  of  the demanded payment, the respondent's appropriated funds from her Escrow Deposit Account by the appellant falls into the category of tax paid in excess as envisaged by the provisions of section 71(1) of Cap 438.

It is on record that the respondent did not dispute the correctness of the calculations/assessment of the claimed  tax  which  she  readily  paid  as demanded by the appellant without reservation. We are therefore of the settled  view  that,  as  the  appropriated  amount of funds from  the  Escrow Deposit  Account  was  not  the  tax  paid  in  excess  by  the  respondent  as envisaged  by subsection  (1)  of section  71  of Cap.  438, she cannot validly apply  to  the  Commissioner  General  for  refund  by  showing  correct  tax calculations supported by documentary  evidence  as required by the provisions of subsection (2) of section 71. This is so because as per evidence on record, the respondent does not dispute the correct tax calculations/assessment which led to the demand notices from the appellant.

Basically,  she  has  nothing  to  show  in  the  application  with  regard  to  the correct  tax  calculations  and  the  supporting  documentary  evidence  as required  by  subsection  (2)  of section  71  of the  same  Act.  It  is  thus  not surprising that the respondent's initial attempt to apply for refund as shown by exhibit A-3 was not completed for lack of supporting correct calculation of tax and documentary evidence.

In the circumstances, considering the material on record with regard to the respondent's claim at the TRAB, we are settled that the provisions of section  71(1)  (2)  and  (3) of Cap.  438 cannot apply in the matter at hand contrary to the appellant's contention.

We are further settled that the provisions of section 71(1), (2) and (3) is  very  clear on  the  issue  of tax  paid  in  excess  and  the  procedure  to  be followed and therefore, it requires no further interpretation.  On the contrary, it  has to  be  interpreted  in  its  plain  meaning  as to do otherwise may bring ambiguity, more so, when applied in the circumstances of the case at hand. To this end,  we wish to  reiterate what we stated in Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited  v. Commissioner  General  Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No. 81 of 2019 (unreported) thus:

- "  ...in the familiar canon of  statutory construction of plain  language,  when  the  words  of a  statute  are

unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete because courts  must presume  that a  legislative  says  in  a statute what it  means and  means  in a statute what  it says  there. As  such,  there  is  no  need  for  the interpolations, test we  stray  into the exclusive preserve of the legislature under the cloak of over zeal interpretation."

Indeed, in Ecolab East Africa (Tanzania) Limited (supra) cited to us by Mr. Kinabo in support of his submission, the Court clearly emphasized the need of adhering to the plain meaning when it stated that:

"if  the words  of  a taxing  statute  are  dear, effect  must be  given to them irrespective of  the  consequences . . . "

From  the  foregoing,  we  are  settled  that  the  circumstances  of  the dispute  between  the  parties  in  this  appeal  cannot  fall  squarely  into  the provisions of section 71(1), (2) and (3) of Cap. 438 as the appellant would like us to so hold. We are satisfied that the appropriation by the appellant of the funds amid the correct tax payment made by the respondent cannot amount to tax paid in excess envisaged under that provision.

In the end, we are settled that the appellant has not sufficiently and legally convinced us to fault the decision of the TRAT which confirmed that

of the TRAB.  We therefore reject the consolidated three grounds of appeal.

Consequently, we dismiss the appeal with costs.
