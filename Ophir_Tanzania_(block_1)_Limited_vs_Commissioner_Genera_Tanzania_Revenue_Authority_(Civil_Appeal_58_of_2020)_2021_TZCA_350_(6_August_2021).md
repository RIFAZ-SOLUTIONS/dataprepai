Tax Appeal No. 43 of 2018

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

29th  June &amp; 6t h  August, 2021

## WAMBALI, J.A.:

This  appeal  emanates  from  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals  Tribunal  (the  TRAT)  delivered  on  1 s t   November,  2019  in  Tax Appeal  No.43 of 2018. The impugned decision confirmed the decision of the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (The TRAB)  in  Tax Appeal  No. 104  of 2014 in respect of withholding tax on payment made by the appellant for services rendered offshore by non-residents in the years 2010 -  2012.

The dispute  between  the  parties  emanated  from  the  audit which was conducted  by the respondent, the Commissioner General, Tanzania

Revenue  Authority  (the  CG-TRA) in March 2014  on  the  appellant covering the years of income 2010 - 2013.  It is in the record of appeal that in the said audit the respondent found, among others matters, that there  was  a  difference  between  the  appellant's  figures  on  imported services  reported  in  the  Value  Added  Tax  (VAT)  returns  compared  to those  reported  in  the  withholding  tax  returns  for  the  requisite  years under the audit.  Noteworthy, after several communications between the parties, it seemed that efforts to sort out the dispute on the findings did not yield fruits.  Consequently,  on  30t h  September,  2014 the  respondent issued the appellant  with a withholding tax certificate demanding payment of TZS. 18,368,593,534.00 being principal tax and interest due.

Aggrieved by the decision of the respondent, the appellant filed an appeal  before  the TRAB,  which  was  however,  dismissed  in  its entirety. The appellant's further appeal to the TRAT was equally dismissed, hence the present appeal.

Particularly, the TRAT held among others that; Firstly, the services the appellant imported from the non-resident persons were rendered  in Tanzania and the payment of service fee paid  by the appellant to non­ resident  persons  had  a  source  in  Tanzania.  Secondly,  the  place  of performance  of the  services  or  place  of  rendering  of services  is  not  a

determinant factor of the source of payment of service fees. Thirdly, the appellant had  obligation  to withhold tax for payments  made to its non­ residents service providers or suppliers in  respect of service rendered to its non-resident  service  providers  or  suppliers  outside  Tanzania but utilized in Tanzania.

It  is  based  on  the  above findings of the TRAT that the  appellant has approached the Court armed with a memorandum of appeal stuffed with two grounds, which we take liberty to reproduce hereunder: -

- 1.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law  in holding  that  irrespective of  place of rendering services as the payment in this appeal was made by the appellant,  who is a resident in Tanzania ; for  services  utilized  in the United Republicthen the payments made are subject to withholding tax under the provisions of sections 6(1)  (b),  69(0  0) and 83(1)  (b) of the Income Tax  Act, 2004.
- 2.  The  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by confirming the decision of the Board that the appellant's  company had obligation  to  withhold tax for the payments made  to its non-resident service provider outside  the  United Republic of Tanzania for  services utilized in the United

Republic under the provisions of  section(s) 6 (1) (b),  69 (i) (ii) and 83 (1) (b) of the Income  Tax

Act, 2004."

It is worth pointing out that at the hearing, the appellant's counsel argued  the  appeal  generally  much  as,  essentially,  the  epicenter  of the complaints in both grounds  of  appeal rest on the alleged wrong interpretation  by the TRAT of the  provisions of section  69  (i)  (ii)  read together with  sections 6  (1)  (b)  and 83  (1)  (b)  of the Income Tax Act, (the ITA) which resulted in the alleged erroneous finding with regard to payment of withholding tax.

During the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was duly represented  by a  consortium  of learned  advocates,  namely;  Mr.  Wilson Kamugisha  Mukebezi,  Mr.  Alan  Kileo,  Ms. Emma  Lyamuya  and  Ms. Catherine Mokiri, all from B  &amp; E Ako Law in Dar es Salaam.

Submitting  in  support  of  the  grounds  of  appeal,  M r. Mukebezi strongly and spiritedly criticized the holding of  the  TRAT  on the interpretation of  the respective alluded to provisions of  the ITA. Particularly, he described the TRAT's interpretation as utterly misconceived  on  the  ground  that  it  focused  on  the  place  where  the recipient resides and  where the services are consumed  contrary to the

intended  meaning  of  the  respective  provisions  of the  law.  He  argued further that the source rule in Tanzania has its root in section 6 (1) (b) of the ITA and that the said provision imposes tax liability to non-resident person's income only to the extent that it has a source in Tanzania.  He also made reference to the provisions of section 69 (i) (ii) of the ITA and argued that the key condition for the payment of service fee to have a source in Tanzania is that it must be attributable to services rendered in Tanzania.

To this end,  he categorically submitted that the place of rendering services  is therefore  paramount.  He further emphasized that the thrust of his argument is supported  by paragraph  (ii) of section  69 of the ITA which  provides  that  where  the  payer  is  the  Government,  the  place  of rendering the services becomes irrelevant.

The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  then  made  reference  to section  83(1)  (b)  of the  ITA and  argued  that the  said  provision  entails that the obligation to withhold tax on service fee arises only if the source requirement  under  section  69  (i)  (ii)  of  the  ITA  is  satisfied.  In  this regard,  he  maintained  that  the  said  provisions  should  not  be  read  in isolation from  section 6 (1)  (b) of the ITA regarding the liability of non­ resident  persons  to  pay  tax  in  Tanzania. Indeed,  in his  view,  the

combined reading of those provisions leads to the interpretation that the withholding tax obligation is not triggered if the service fee paid does not have a source in the United Republic of Tanzania.

Ultimately, Mr. Mukebezi submitted that in the instant case therefore,  the  service  fee  payment  could  only  have  had  a  source  in Tanzania  if it was attributable to services  rendered  in Tanzania.  On the contrary,  he  argued,  in  the  instant  case,  the  services  were  rendered outside Tanzania. To support his argument, Mr.  Mukebezi, relied on the decision of  the Court  in  The  Commissioner  General,  Tanzania Revenue Authority v. Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited, Civil Appeal No. 146 of 2015 (unreported).

It is however,  significant  to  state  that  though Mr. Mukebezi acknowledged  the  fact  that  the  decision  of  the  TRAT  was  heavily influenced by the decision of the Court in Tullow Tanzania BV v. The Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No.24 of 2018, which was also followed in Shell Deep Water Tanzania BV v. The Commissioner General, Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal No.  1 2 3 of 2018 and The  Commissioner  General, Tanzania  Revenue  Authority v.  Aggreko  International  Projects Limited,  Civil  Appeal No.  1 4 8 of  2018  (all unreported),  he  strongly

criticized that decision on the argument that the Court wrongly relied on improper definitions of the word "rendered" to arrive to the conclusion that withholding tax is applicable for payment made to non-resident for services rendered outside Tanzania.

The  learned  counsel  also  criticized  the  Court  in  relying  on  its decisions  in  BP  Tanzania  Limited  v.  The  Commissioner  General Tanzania Revenue Authority,  Civil Appeal No.  1 2 5 of 2015 (unreported) because it dealt with the interpretation of section 69 (e) of the ITA and that of Barrick Gold PLC v. The Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority,  Civil Appeal No.  1 6 of 2015 (unreported),  in  which  the  issue  involved  a   tax  avoidance transaction scheme.  That  reliance therefore,  he argued,  led  the  Court  to  wrongly conclude that withholding tax  is  payable for payment made for service rendered by non-resident persons while out of Tanzania.

Mr.  Mukebezi  further faulted  the  holding  of the  Court  in   Tullow Tanzania BV {supra) for holding that the word "rendered" used under section 69 (i)  (ii) of the ITA is synonymous to the words "supplied" or "delivered".

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the appellant sought to rely  on a book  by  Reuven  Avi  Yonah  on  International  Tax  as

International  Law:  Analysis  of International  Tax  Regime which discusses  at  length  the  problem  of territorial  jurisdiction  (source)  and how the  international  community  has formulated  rules to avoid  double taxation,  which  rules  have acquired  international  norm  status.  In  short, he emphasized that the said rules provide that in assessing the payment of  services  rendered,  the  place  where  the  service  provider  is  located prevails.

In  this  regard, Mr. Mukebezi  implored  us  to  depart  from  the decision in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra) and follow the decision in Pan African  Energy  Tanzania  Limited {supra) resulting  in  allowing  the appeal  with  costs.  Noteworthy,  the  prayer  of the  learned  counsel  was premised on the contention that: -

Firstly, in relation to service  "perform"  is the most  natural meaning  of the word  "render" as  used  in  section  69  (i)  (ii)  of the  ITA which  speaks of "employment exercised" and "service  rendered" in the same breath in relation to service fees.

Secondly,  in  its  plain  English  meaning  the  word  "render"  (in relation  to  employment  or  the  giving  service)  means  to  perform  as defined  in  Oxford  Advanced  Learner's  Dictionary,  8t h   Edition  at  page 1248. In addition,  Mr.  Mukebezi  made reference to the online dictionary

(www.dictionarv.com) on the definition of the word "render" in its widest connotation.  To  this  end,  he  concluded  that  those  trusted  dictionaries define  the  word  render  (rendered,  rendering)  as  perform  (performed, performing). Consequently, he submitted that payment made to the non­ resident service providers by  the appellant  were not  so paid for delivering  of the  said  services  and  thus they were  paid  for  performing the services.

Thirdly, in the learned counsel's view, the holding of the Court in Tullow  Tanzania  Bv {supra) that  if  the  service  is  rendered  "TO"  a resident of Tanzania then withholding tax is applicable is wrong because the law provides that for withholding tax to apply, the service should be rendered "IN" Tanzania. In this regard, Mr.  Mukebezi made reference to the  definition  of  the  words  "IN"  and  "TO"  in  the  Oxford  Advanced Learners  Dictionary,  8t h   Edition  in  which  "IN" is  defined  to  mean  "at a point within  an  area  or  space" and  "TO" to  mean  "in  the  direction  of something  or  toward  something"  as  reflected  at  pages  56  and  1569, respectively.

In addition, he  made  reference  to  the  Collins  Dictionary  and Thesaurus in which the word "IN" is defined to mean "inside or within"

while the term "TO" as a preposition is used to indicate the destination of the subject or object of an action.

In the premises, relying on those definitions, he submitted that the phrase "rendering services in the United Republic of Tanzania will plainly mean  to  render  service  inside  or  within  Tanzania  whereas  "rendering services to  a  resident of Tanzania",  will  plainly  mean  to  render service directed  to  or to  which  the  destination  is Tanzania.  In  his  submission, therefore, the two words do not mean the same thing.

Fourthly,  the reliance by  the Court  on the  decision of BP Tanzania  Limited {supra) was  plainly  wrong  because  in  that  appeal, the Court dealt with the interpretation of the provisions of section 69 (e), while  in  Tuliow  Tanzania  Bv {supra) the  decision  revolved  on  the interpretation  of  section  69  (i)  (ii)  of  the  ITA  which  provisions  have different objectives.  Moreover,  in  his view, the  reliance by the Court on its  decision  in   Barrick  Gold  PLC  (supra)  was  equally  wrong  because there  was  no  tax  avoidance  scheme  to  influence  the  Court to  observe that there was a modern approach in interpretation of tax statutes.

In essence,  he emphasized that in Tullow Tanzania Bv (supra), the  main  issue  which  the  Court  had  to  consider  and  determine  was whether the appellant was required to withhold tax for payments it made

to its non-resident consultants for the services rendered off shore as far as section 69(i) (ii) of the ITA is concerned. In the end, pressing reliance on the decision of the Court in Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited (supra) he urged us to allow the appeal with costs.

On the adversary side, the attendance of the respondent was duly expressed by the presence of Ms. Gloria Achimpota, learned Senior State Attorney assisted  by  Mr.  Noa  Tito,  M r.  Harold  Gugami  and  M r.  Marcel Busegano, all learned State Attorneys.

As  a  lead  counsel  for  the  respondent,  Ms.  Achimpota  strongly resisted  the  appeal.  Notably,  she  fully  adopted  the  written  submission lodged by the respondent in Court earlier on.

Upon being invited to address the Court, she out rightly supported the decision of the TRAT and its reliance on the decision of the Court in Tullow  Tanzania Bv {supra) which was  followed by  two other decisions,  namely;  Shell  Deep  Water  Tanzania  Bv  and  Aggreko International Projects Limited {supra).

In her further submission, she characterized the appellant's counsel stand that withholding tax obligation is not triggered if service paid does not have a source in the United Republic of Tanzania and that service fee payment  has  source  in  Tanzania  only  if  it  is  attributable  to  service

rendered  in  Tanzania  as  misconceived.  On  the  contrary,  she  supported the  TRAT's  holding  that  the  appellant  had  an  obligation  to  withhold income tax from  the  payments  made to  non-residents for the  services rendered. She maintained that the payment made by the appellant had a source  in Tanzania. Particularly, the learned Senior  State  Attorney argued  that  as  the  services  for  which  the  payments  were  made  were consumed or utilized by the appellant in the United Republic of Tanzania for purpose of earning income in Tanzania, the payments made for such services had a source in the United Republic and thus the appellant had to withhold  tax  under section  83(1)  (b)  of the  ITA.  In  this  regard,  she argued that the word  rendered under section 69 (i) is synonymous with the words "supplied" or "delivered".

On the other hand, she submitted that the reliance by the TRAT on the decision of the Court in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra) was made in accordance  with  the  law  and  the  evidence  that  the  services  were rendered  and  performed  in  Tanzania  and  the  appellant failed  to  prove the contrary when the payment was made to a non-resident. In her firm view,  the  desire  of the appellant to  question  the  legality of the  Court's decision  in  Tullow  Tanzania  Bv {supra) in favour  of  that  in  Pan African  Energy Tanzania  Limited {supra) is  unfounded.  She  firmly

submitted that the Court rightly distinguished that decision holding that it could not apply in the circumstances of the appeal in Tullow Tanzania Limited (supra), and so is the present appeal.

In  her  further  submission,  she  stated  that  since  payments  were made in Tanzania they are subject to withholding tax under section  83 (1) (c) of the ITA read together with section 6  (1) (b) of the same Act. In the  circumstances,  she  urged  the  Court  to  reject  the  proposal  of  the counsel for the appellant to adopt the definitions of the word  rendered contained in the  dictionaries  alluded  to  above because  in  Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra) the Court correctly construed the proper intent of the  legislature on the  meaning of the said term as it was influenced  by the  interpretation of the  law as it were before the amendment effected by the Finance Act, No. 2  of 2016 and the Finance Act, No.8 of 2020.

Moreover, Ms. Achimpota submitted that the alluded to international jurisprudence concerning the definition and explanation on the  rules  on  the  word  source  described  in  the  book  by  Reuven  Avi Yonah, cannot in anyway supersede or overrule the definition of the term source as interpreted  by the Court in Tullow Tanzania  Bv {supra). In this regard, she urged us not to depart from that decision as it is a good

law. In conclusion, the learned Senior State Attorney implored the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

At this juncture, we wish to preface our deliberation on the merits or otherwise of  the appeal by making reference  to  the relevant provisions  of the  law,  the  subject of the  instant appeal,  as  they  were before the amendments.

Section  6(1)  (b)  of the ITA concerns the  chargeable  income to a non-resident person. It provides as follows: -

"6 (1) subject to the provision of  subsection (2), the chargeable income of  a person for a year of  income from any employment business or investment shall be: -

- (a)  N/A
- (b) In  the  case  of a  non-resident person,  the person's income  from  employment\  business or investment for the year of  income, but only to the extent that the income has a source in the United Republic."

On the other hand, section 69 (i) (ii) of the ITA states that: -

"69 The following payment have a source in the United Republic.

- (a) -(h) N/A

- (i) Payments,  including  service  fees  of a type not mentioned in paragraphs (a) or (h)  or attributable  to  employment exercised\ service rendered or a forbearance from exercising employment or "rendering service".
- (it) In  the  United Republicregardless  of the place of  payment, or..."

Moreover, section 83(1) of the ITA specifically provides as follows:-

"83 (1) subject to sub-section (2), a resident  person who: -

(a)  N/A

(b) Pays  a  service  fee  or  an  insurance  premium with a source in  United Republic to a non-resident person shall withhold income tax from the payment at the rate provided for in paragraph  4(c)  of the First  Schedule."

Admittedly,  the  Court  in  Tullow  Tanzania  Bv {supra) made thorough  discussion  concerning  the  above  stated  provisions  and  made reference to other decisions in BP Tanzania Limited and Pan African Energy Tanzania  Limited {supra) and  then  it  extensively  stated  as follows: -

" Reading sections 6 (1) (b),  69 (i) (ii) and 83 (1) (b), all together  gives two conditions for a payment

to  a  non-resident  to  be  subjected  to  withholding tax.  These are: -

- (I) the service of  which the payment is made must be rendered in the United Republic of Tanzania, and
- the  payment should  have  a  source  in  the
- (2) United Republic of Tanzania.

The withholding obligation under  section 83(1) (b) of the Act applies to a payment for service  fee with a  source  in the United Republic of Tanzania and  section 69 stipulates what payment have a  source in  the  United Republic of Tanzania."

## The Court then reasoned: -

"It is our strong view that the word rendered used under section  69  (i)  (i)  is  synonymous  to  words "supplied" or  "delivered".  In  this  regard,  a  non­ resident  who provides services  to  a  resident,  has delivered/supplied  services  to  a  resident  of  the United Republic of Tanzania.

The recipient of  the service is actually the payer for such services,  in  which  case,  "source  of  payment" cannot be any other place except where the payer resides. In other words, as the services of  which the payment were made were consumed or utilized by the appellant in the United Republic of Tanzania for purposes of earning income in the United Republic,

then payments made for such services had a source in the United  Republic  of  Tanzania &gt; and  the respondent had to withhold tax under section 83(1) (c) of  the  A ct"

It is also not out of place to point out that in the said decision the Court  considered  the  Indian  Income  Tax  Act, 1961  for  purpose  of relating  to  the  decision  in  Pan  African  Energy  Tanzania  Limited (supra) and stated thus: -

"As  opposed  to  the  Indian  Income Act  1961  (as amended in 2010),  where its section 9 provides for Income deemed to have a source in India . " Section  69 of the  Tanzania Income  Tax Act deals with "source of  payment. " These are two distinct concepts  and it is  our  considered  view  that  one cannot rely on an interpretation of  section 9 of the Indian Income Tax 1961 (as amended) in interpreting section 69 of the Tanzania Income Tax Act, 2004.  While "income is earned,""Payments are made,"in which case the rules for determination of where a particular income is earned cannot be the same as the rules in determining where a particular payment  originates.  Payment  ordinarily  originates from  where the payer is, regardless of where such payments are effected."

The  Act  imposes  a  withholding  obligation  on  a service  fee  based  on  the  source  of payment  of such fees, this being the case therefore,  we see no ambiguity on section  69 (i) (ii).  The key question that  the  Court is  invited  to  look into  is  not  the nature  of  the  payment,  but  rather,  the  source where the payment originated.

In our view,  the Court's finding in respect of the case of Pan African Energy (supra)  was much influenced by findings of  the Tribunal that section 9(1) (vii) (c) of the Indian Income  Tax Act is in parimateria with section 69  of  the Tanzania Income Tax".

Most significantly, the Court then reproduced the said provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 and concluded as follows: -

"It is dear from the wording of  the  provisions above that  they  are  substantially  different  from  section 69(i) (ii).  While the Indian Act talks of  the source of income, on the other hand section 69 (i) (i) talks of source  of payment The  case  of Pan  African Energy (supra)  is  therefore  distinguishable  as  it relied on the interpretation of  section 9(1) (vii) c) of the Indian Income Tax  Act to arrive at  a finding that the said  provision, as it was, was in parimateria with section 69(i) (ii) of  the  Act."

We  have  deliberately  extensively  reproduced  the  reasoning  and holding  of  the  Court  in  Tullow  Tanzania  Bv {supra) in order  to appreciate  the  substance  of  the  position  of  the  law  as  expounded concerning the interpretation of the complained of respective provisions of the ITA.

Indeed,  it is appreciated that at the hearing of the appeal counsel for the parties, conceded, both in their written and oral submissions, that the  decision  of  the  Court  in  Tullow  Tanzania  Bv {supra) on  the interpretation  of  the  said  provisions  of  the  ITA  was  followed  later  in Shell Deep  Water  Tanzania Bv and Aggreko  International Projects Limited {supra) decided on  11t h  April  2019 and 4t h  July, 2019 respectively.  Particularly,  in  the  latter decision,  the  Court expressed  its concurrence with the decision  in Tullow Tanzania  Bv {supra) when  it stated thus: -

"We firmly subscribe  to  the position  held by this Court as expounded in Tullow Tanzania Bv case (supra)  a  position  also  adopted  in Shell  Deep Water Tanzania Bv (supra) on the issue o f"the source" and "services rendered" and also where it was stated that as the recipient of the service is the  actual  payer  for  such  service, the "source payment"  has to be where the payer resides."

It is thus  not surprising,  in our view that,  as the dispute  between the  parties was on the  interpretation  of the complained  of provisions, the  decision  of the TRAT,  the  subject of this  appeal  was  greatly  and correctly  influenced  by the decision  of the Court in  Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra). We however take cognizance of the fact that in his spirited submission at the hearing the appellant's counsel bitterly contested that decision  on  the argument that it is  bad  law  and  thus,  it could  not  be relied upon by the TRAT to hold as it did.

On our part, we must state that we have thoroughly scanned the record of appeal and we are satisfied that the facts and circumstances of  the  case  in  the  present  appeal  are  similar  with  that  obtaining  in Tullow Tanzania  Bv {supra). In  the  circumstances,  we  are  settled that  the  TRAT  correctly  decided  as  it  did  and  properly  followed  the decision of the Court in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra).

Moreover, we are alive to the invitation of the learned counsel for the  appellant  to  us  to  depart  from  that  decision  in  favour  of  Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited (supra) on the contention that the former is bad law.

Nevertheless, we must make it clear that the respective argument is not novel. Our research indicates that the same argument was made before the Court by the appellant's counsel in National Microfinance

Bank  Limited  (NMB)  v.  The  Commissioner  General,  Tanzania Revenue  Authority,  Civil  Appeal  No. 168  of  2018  (unreported). However,  in  the  end  the  Court  followed  what  it  stated  and  held  in Tullow Tanzania  Bv {supra). Most  unfortunately,  this  decision  was not brought to the attention of the Court by the learned counsel for the parties at the  hearing  of the instant appeal, though the same counsel for the appellant acted for NMB.  Apparently, in NMB {supra) reference was  also  made  to  the  decision  of  the  Court  in  Shell  Deep  Water Tanzania  Bv {supra). However,  no  reference was  made to Aggreko International  Projects  Limited {supra), notably  because  it  was decided later, that is, on 4t h  July, 2019.

Be that as it may, the crucial  point is that in  NMB {supra), after considering the invitation of the appellant's counsel to depart from the decision in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra), the Court stated as follows: -

"We just as well subscribe to the reasoning of the Court  in  distinguishing  from  it  the  case  of Pan African Energy (supra).  That being  the position' , we  find  no cause to embrace  the  appellant's invitation to  us  to  depart  from  the  decision  in Tullow. We note  that,  of recent,  a  corresponding stance was adopted by the Court in the unreported Civil Appeal No.  123  of 2018 Shell Deep  Water Tanzania Bv. v. Commissioner General (TRA)."

Similarly,  in   the  instant appeal,  having  regard to factual  setting  in the record of appeal on the dispute between the parties and the settled position  of the  law on  the  interpretation  of the  respective  provisions of the ITA stated  above, we reaffirm the holding that the decision  in  Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited {supra) was correctly distinguished in  Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra).

In  the  circumstances,  we  respectfully decline the  invitation  of the appellant's  counsel  to  hold  that  the  decision  in  Pan  African  Energy Tanzania  Limited {supra) applies to the  circumstances of the  instant appeal.  We  do  not  also  think that the  interpretation  of the  respective words  proposed  by the appellant's counsel as described  in the referred dictionaries can apply in the circumstances of this appeal  in view of the decision  in  Tullow Tanzania  Bv {supra). On  the  other  hand,  we  are mindful of the invitation of the appellant's counsel to the Court to depart from that decision as alluded to above. Nevertheless, we respectfully find the  invitation  misplaced.  This  is so  because apart from  not finding  any patent error in  the  said  decision,  it is  not within  the jurisdiction  of the Full  Court  to  depart  from  the  decision  of  the  same  Court,  however erroneous it might be.

At this juncture,  it is instructive to make reference to the decision of  the  Court  in  Abually  Alibhai  Aziz  v.  Bhatia  Brothers  Limited, Miscellaneous Civil Appeal No.l of 1999 (unreported) in which the Court earlier on in Civil Appeal No. 42 of 1995 (unreported) involving the same parties followed  the  procedure of referring  such  kind  of prayers to the Full  Bench of the Court as per the procedure laid down by the erstwhile Court of Appeal for East Africa in P.H.R. Poole v. R [1960]  E.A.  62. In that appeal it was specifically stated that: -

"A   Full  Court of Appeal has no greater powers than  the division  of the  Court,  but if it is to be contended that there  are  grounds,  upon  which the Court could act, for departing from a previous decision of  the Court, it  is obviously desirable that the  matter should,  if practicable,  be  considered by a bench of  five  judges."

It  is  in   that  regard  that  in   Freeman  Aikael  Mbowe  and  the Hon. Attorney General v. Alex O. Lema, Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2001 (unreported) the Court stated categorically that: -

"...In the practice of  this Court, a Full Bench may overrule an earlier  precedent in one of  two ways. In  the first place it may do so in  the process of resolving a conflict in the decisions of the Court. This is the traditional way and does not require

elaboration. However, in appropriate circumstances a Full Bench may, when so required depart from a previous decision  of the Court without there being conflicting decisions on the matter at  issue..."

## More importantly, the Court stated further that: -

"Admittedly where the Full Bench departs from a decision of three judges the effect is to overrule that decision because it cannot stand side by side with and in competition to the decision of  the Full Bench, "[see. also Mussa Arbogast Mutalemwa v.  The  Republic,  Criminal  Application  No.  5   of 1996 (unreported)].

From the foregoing, with profound respect, we hold the firm view that  the  invitation  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  to  us  to depart from the decision of the Court in Tullow Tanzania Bv {supra) is totally  misplaced.  Besides,  it  is  our  settled  position  that  in   view  of the settled position of the law by the Court on the complained of interpretation  of the  provisions  of  ITA  with  regard  to  withholding  tax obligation,  the  TRAT  properly  followed  the  respective  decision  to  hold that  the  appellant  was  duty  bound  to  withhold  tax  on  payments  that

were made to non-residents. Therefore, we find that the TRAT properly and correctly confirmed the decision of the TRAB.

Consequently, we hold that the two grounds of appeal are without substance.  In the circumstances, considering our deliberation above, we find  that the  appeal  is  devoid  of  merit,  and  we  hereby dismiss  it with costs.
