## RULING

15th  &amp; 17t h  June, 2022

## MWANDAMBO. J.A.:

Before  me  in  this  ruling  is  an  application  for  extension  of  time  to serve  of  a  copy  of  notice  of  appeal  on  the  respondent.  The  notice  of appeal emanates  from  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Tribunal  at Zanzibar made against the applicant on 26/02/2021 in Tax Appeal No.  lof 2019.

The  tale  behind  the  instant  application  is  told  by  the  affidavits  of Salum  Ali Mussa  and  Osward  Rusibamayila  annexed  to  the  notice  of motion.  It  goes  thus:  following  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal,  M/s  East

Africa  Law  Chambers,  a  law  firm  of  advocates  based  in  Dar  es  Salaam prepared  a  notice  of  appeal  which  was  lodged  before  the  Tribunal  at Zanzibar  on  03/03/2021  by  Salum  Ali  Mussa;  the  applicant's  Principal Officer.  In  terms  of  rule  84  (1)  of  the  Tanzania  Court  of  Appeal  Rules, 2009 (the  Rules),  the  applicant  had  an  obligation  to  serve  a  copy of the notice of appeal before or within  14 days after lodging it. According to the affidavit of Salum Ali  Mussa,  he  inadvertently left all  copies of the  notice of  appeal  with  the  Tribunal's  registry  on  the  mistaken  understanding  of the  relevant  procedure  after  the  lodgement.  By  the  time  the  applicant's advocate  realised  that  a  copy  of  the  notice  of  appeal  had  not  yet  been served  on  the  respondent  in  April  2021,  time  for  doing  so  had  already elapsed. All the same, the applicant's advocates went ahead and lodged a record and memorandum of appeal in the Court on 28/04/2021 and had a copy  served  on  the  respondent  on  06/05/2021. Five days  later, on 11/05/2021, to be exact, the applicant served the respondent with a copy of  the notice  of  appeal followed by  the instant  application filed on 21/05/2011.

The applicant has premised her application on three grounds set out in the notice of motion to wit;  misunderstanding of the instructions by Mr.

Salum  Ali  Mussa  from  his  counsel  on  the  procedure  to  serve  a  copy  of notice of appeal,  the  respondent  has already  been  served  with  the  copy and,  the  delay  in  serving  the copy  has  not  prejudiced  or occasioned  any injustice on the respondent.

Resisting  the  application,  the  respondent  has filed  two  affidavits  in reply noting most  of  the averments in the founding affidavits but disputing just a few of them.  In  particular, the respondent avers that the misunderstanding of the  instructions to  serve  a  copy  of notice of appeal notwithstanding,  the  applicant  had  an  obligation  to  serve  it  within  the prescribed period and since this was not done, the applicant was bound to explain away the delay.

At  the  hearing  of  the  application,  Mr. Lulinga  Jonathan  Lulinga, learned advocate  represented  the  applicant. Essentially, Mr. Lulinga's submissions were a repeat of the grounds in the notice of motion and the averments  in  the  affidavit  all  boiling  down  to  the  averments  made  by Salum Ali  Mussa  stated  in  his  affidavit  stating  that that  he  left  copies  of the notice of appeal with the Tribunal's registry on a mistaken understanding  that  a  copy  will  be  served  on  the  respondent  by  the Tribunal's staff.  The  learned  advocate  referred to the affidavit of Osward

and Rusibamayila  regarding the discovery that a  notice of appeal was not served  on  the  respondent  and  the  efforts  taken  thereafter  to  serve  the copy,  albeit  belatedly  on  11/05/2021,  five  days  after  the  service  of the record and  memorandum of appeal on the respondent and subsequently, lodging  the  application  for  extension  of  time.  By  those  averments,  the learned  advocate  impressed  upon  the  Court  to  find  that  the  application has exhibited good cause warranting the exercise of discretion  under rule 10 of the Rules.

According to  Mr.  Lulinga,  the applicant has advanced a valid  reason for  the  delay  in  serving  a  copy  of  the  notice  of  appeal  and  had  fully explained  away the  delay  in  line with the  principles set out in Lyamuya Construction  Co.  Ltd  v.  Board  of  Registered  Trustees  of  Young Women's Christian  Association  of Tanzania, Civil  Application  No.  2 of 2010 (unreported).

Besides,  Mr.  Lulinga  contended  that the granting  of the application will  not prejudice the  respondent and  referred  me to the Court's decision in Registered  Trustees  of  Evangelical  Assemblies  of  God  (T) (EAGT) v.  Reverend  Dr. John  Mahene, Civil  Application  No.  518/4 of 2017 (unreported) stressing that proposition. The learned advocate urged

the Court to exercise  its discretion  in the applicant's favour  by extending time to serve a copy of notice of appeal on the respondent.

Mr.  Hospis  Maswanyia  learned  Senior  State  Attorney  appeared  for the respondent, assisted by Ms. Fatma Abdallah also Senior State Attorney to resist the application. Predicating his submission on Lyamuya Construction (supra) and  Ngao Godwin  Losero v. Julius Mwarabu, Civil  Application  No.  10  of  2015  (unreported),  Mr.  Maswanyia  urged  the Court  to  dismiss  the  application. However,  the  learned Senior  State Attorney  did  not  appear  to  challenge  the  reason  behind  the  delay  in serving  a  copy  of  the  notice  of  appeal  but  argued  that  the  affidavit  of Salum  Ali  Mussa  has  not  fully  accounted  for  each day  of  delay  which militated  against  the  exercise  of  discretion  in  her  favour. According  to him, the delay in question was inordinate enough to be condoned.

As to whether the respondent will  be prejudiced  by the grant of the application,  Mr.  Maswanyia was emphatic that the  respondent will  indeed be  prejudiced  because  he  has  now  been  placed  in  a  position  to  halt collection  of the tax.  He  made that argument even though  by  para  21  of the  affidavit  in  reply  deponed  by  Fatma  Abdallah  Hassan,  the  deponent had  averred  that  no  tax  collection  measures  had  been  taken  or  being

contemplated other than reminding the applicant of the tax debt obligations.  On the whole, the learned Senior State Attorney charged that the applicant cannot be talking of prejudice  in  a  case where she  has  not been  diligent  in serving a  copy  of  the  notice  of  appeal  within  the prescribed  period or,  at best, filing  the  application  for extension  of time immediately  upon  discovery  that  the  respondent  had  not  been  served with such copy. He invited me to have regard to the decision of the Court in Karibu  Textile  Mills  Ltd  v.  Commissioner  General  (TRA), Civil Application No.  192/20 of 2016 (unreported) on the principle that exercise of  discretion  in  favour  of  the  applicant  is  conditional  upon  existence  of some  material before the Court  which were lacking in the instant application.

With  the  foregoing  background  and  the substance  of the  learned counsel's submissions,  I will  now turn  my attention the discussion on the merits of the application which  requires the court to satisfy itself whether sufficient material  has been  placed for the exercise of discretion  in favour of the applicant.

For a start,  although  it may not be entirely necessary,  I propose  to highlight the rationale behind service of notice of  appeal on the

respondent provided by rule 84 (1) of the Rules; a replica of rule 77 (1) of the revoked Court of  Appeal Rules, 1979. The rationale has been underscored by the Court  in its decisions and stated to ensure that the respondent  is  made  aware  of the  intended  appeal  against  him.  See  for instance; National  Microfinance  Bank v.  Muyodeso, Civil  Appeal  No. 289 of 2019  referred  subsequently in Grumet Reserves Ltd v.  Morice Akiri, Civil Appeal  No.  334  of  2019  and Raphael  Andrea  Ologi  v. Musoma  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  468  of 2020  (all  unreported).  It  has  been  held that failure to serve a copy of notice of appeal timeously or at all is fatal omission to the appeal for it amounts to failure to take one of the essential steps in the appeal warranting an order striking out the notice of appeal  under rule 89 (2)  of  the  Rules. See  the  Court's  decisions  in Kantibhai  M.  Patel  v. Dahyabhai F. Mistry [2003] T.L.R. 437, Francis Itengeja v. Kampuni ya  Kusindika  Mafuta  Ltd [1997] T.L.R.  148 cited  in John  Nyakimwi v.  The  Registered  Trustees  of Catholic  Diocese  of  Musoma, Civil Application No. 85/08 of 2017 (unreported). See also: Boniphace Anyisile  Mwabukusi  v.  Atupele  Fredy  Mwakibete  &amp;  Others, Civil Appeal No. 46 of 2021  (unreported). This would explain why the applicant had  to  seek the  Court's  indulgence through  this  application  even  though she had served the respondent with a record and memorandum of appeal within  a period  of  slightly  above two  months  from  the  date  of  the impugned decision.

I  need  not be detained on what it takes for the Court to exercise its discretion,  for the law is so settled that one need not cite any authority in that  regard.  I  will  only  cite Lyamuya  Construction  Co.  Ltd (supra) which  summarizes  the  factors  to  be  taken  into  account  in  considering whether time should  be extended. However,  it should  be  borne  in  mind that such factors are only a guide rather than fixed formular to be applied with  mathematical  precision in each and every case it being trite law that each case has to be decided on own peculiar  facts.

One  of  the  factors  to  be  considered  is  the  reason  for  the  delay. There  is  hardly  any  dispute  on  that  and  indeed,  Mr.  Maswanyia  did  not offer  any  contrary  argument  against  that. I would  thus  accept  the applicant's  reason  for the  delay that  it  was  due  to  failure  to  understand the nature of the instructions Salum Ali Mussa got from Osward Rusibamayila  regarding  requirement to  serve  a  copy  on  the  respondent after lodging the notice of appeal  before the Tribunal  registry in Zanzibar.

This  is  more  so  considering  that  the  applicant's  advocates  are  based  in Dar es  Salaam  and  hence the  instruction  to  Salum  Ali  Mussa,  a  Principal Officer  and  presumably  a  layperson  to  lodge  which  it  which he  did  but failed  to  serve  a  copy  on  the  respondent  on  a  mistaken  understanding that the service would be done by the Tribunal staff.

Next for my consideration  is the length of the delay.  Mr.  Maswanyia impressed  upon  me to  accept that a  delay of more than  one  month  was too  inordinate  to  be  condoned. That  may  be  so  depending  on  the peculiar circumstances. However,  Mindful of the  rationale behind service of a  notice  of appeal  on  the  respondent can  it  be  said  that the  delay  in this  application  is  inordinate?  As  indicated  earlier,  the  respondent  has noted  most of the averments in the founding affidavits including the fact that the applicant's advocate based in Dar es Salaam, discovered the want of service late in  April,  2021  at the time of compiling  a  record  of appeal. In  my view,  mindful  of the  rationale  behind  service  of  notice  of appeal, there  can be no  doubt  that  the respondent  became  aware  of  the existence of the appeal as opposed to an intended appeal on 06/05/2021 upon  being  served  with  a  record  and  memorandum  of appeal. By  that time,  it was obvious that the applicant had  not complied  with  rule 84 (1)

of the Rules which would  have triggered  in  an application  for striking out the  notice  of appeal  under  rule  89  (2)  of the  Rules.  The  respondent did not  wish  to  pursue  that  and  if  he  had  such  an  intention,  he  was  pre­ empted  by the  application  lodged  on  21/05/2021,  ten days  after  being served with a copy of the notice of appeal, albeit belatedly and mistakenly since there was no order extending time within which to do so.  Viewed in that context,  I cannot say with  any degree of certitude that the applicant was  not  diligent  as  Mr. Maswanyia  urged  me  to  hold. Neither  am  I prepared  to  accept  that  the  delay  was  so  inordinate  to  be  condoned.  I agree that the applicant engaged herself in efforts to serve the respondent  with  a  notice  of  appeal  on  11/05/2021  instead  of  filing  an application  for  extension  of time  but that can  only  be viewed  from  poor judgment rather than lack of diligence; one of the factors to be considered in considering applications for extension of time,  as it were.

Having held that the length of the delay was not inordinate and that in  the  circumstances  the  applicant  did  not  exhibit  lack  of  diligence,  it seems  to  me  that,  taken  in  its  totality,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  the applicant  has, on balance  of  probabilities, explained  away  the  delay warranting  the exercise of discretion  in  her favour. That takes  me to yet

another factor to  be  considered  in  applications  such  as this one;  will  the respondent  be  prejudiced  if  the  time  sought  is  extended? The  word prejudice  is defined  by the Black's  Law  Dictionary/ 8th   Edition,  Bryan A. Garner to mean:

"Damage  or  detriment  to  one's  legal  rights  or claims" [At  p.  1218]

In  paragraph 21 of the affidavit in reply deponed by Fatma Abdallah Hassan  responding  to  para  20  of  the  affidavit  of  Saium  Ali  Mussa,  the deponent  denied having commenced  or  harboring any intention to commence execution  of the decree of the Tribunal. During  the  hearing, Mr.  Maswanyia  was  adamant  that  the  grant  of  the  application  will  be prejudicial  on the  respondent because it will  impact on  his right to collect the tax due. The  learned  Senior State Attorney did  not say anything  on the kind of prejudice or detriment likely to  be suffered  in  relation  to the appeal  or  the  hearing  of  it. Be  that  as  it  may,  it  is  trite  that  through section  24(4)  of the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Act  [Cap  408  R.E.  2019]  the mere  notice  of  appeal  does  not  bar  the  execution  of the  decree  of the Tribunal.  That  is  the  same  position  of  the  law  under  rule  11  (3)  of  the Rules.  It  defeats  logic  and  commonsense  for  the  respondent  who  has

denied  taking  any  tax  recovery  measures  following  the  decision  of  the Tribunal to contend  as  he does that the grant of the application to serve on her a copy  of  the notice of  appeal will be detrimental to the enforcement of  his  right to  collect the  tax  due  following  the  decision  of the Tribunal made in his favour.

At  any  rate,  it  has  not  been  suggested  that  the  applicant  delayed service of  the notice of  appeal on  the respondent  with  a view  to benefiting from  such  course considering  that the  lodgment of a  notice of appeal  is  not  a  bar to  execution.  Neither  has  it  been  suggested  that the respondent has been prejudiced from the hearing of the appeal by reason of the delay in serving a copy of the notice of appeal considering that the appeal has not yet been scheduled for hearing.

In the upshot, guided by the Registered Trustees of Evangelical Assemblies  of  God  (T)  EAGT (supra)  that  taken  in  their  totality,  the facts  in  this  application  warrant  the  Court's  exercise  of discretion  in  the applicant's  favour. In  my view,  doing  otherwise  will  militate  against the warning sounded  in VIP  Engineering  and  Marketing  Limited  v. Salim  Said  Bakhressa, Civil  Application  No.  47  of  1996  (unreported)

thus;  not  every  procedural  sins  shall  result  in  the  death  of justice.  The following excerpt will serve to express the warning:

" While the importance of  litigants complying with the rules of procedure cannot be overemphasized\  it must not  be  forgotten  that there  is  danger  of consumers  of justice  losing confidence  in  the  courts  if judicial  officers  are obsessed more with strict compliance with procedural  rules  than  what  the  merits  of  the disputes  before  them  are. To  stray  into  that ■ error is to aid the  judicatures grave diggers."

Whilst I do  not condone the non-compliance with  rule 84 (1) of the Rules, I am far from  being persuaded that, viewed on its own facts, the delay in this application,  was so grave a sin resulting into refusing the application for enlargement of time.

In the  event, guided by  the  Court's  decision on  the  effect  of applications  for  extension  of  time  to  be  retrospective  in  their  nature underscored in Tanzania Harbours Authority v. Mohamed R. Mohamed [2003] T.L.R.  76,  I  grant the application  and extend the time sought to  11/05/2021, the date on which the applicant served  a copy of

notice of appeal  on the respondent Costs shall abide the outcome of the appeal.

It is so ordered.

DATED at ZANZIBAR this 17t h  day of June, 2022.
