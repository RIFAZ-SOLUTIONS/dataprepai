(Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal of Tanzania at Dsr es Salaam )

/Hon.  H.  Mataka, Vice Chairman,  Mr. W.  Nyetabula and Prof. 3.  Derive, Members)

dated  the 30th  day of April, 2.014 in Tax Appeal No. 52 of 2013

## RULING OF THE COURT

16th   February, &amp; 2 2 nd August,  2016

## OTBMAN, CJ.

The  respondent,  relying  on  Rule  21  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  Rules,  2001  (the Rules)  raises a  preliminary objection to the effect that  the  appellant's  appeal  is  bad  in  law  as  neither  the  decision  nor  the decree incorporated in the record of appeal were signed by all the members of the Tribunal who heard the appeal.

Mr. Juma  Beleko,  learned Advocate for the respondent submitted that the  words "Sgn" appearing  after  the  name  of each  of the  members  of the Tribunal in the copy of the decision contained in the record of appeal did not amount to the decision  having  been signed  by them.  For a decision to be a proper decision in law, it must bear the signature of the members. The words " Sgif ,  he  urged, were insufficient to constitute a signature under Rule 21.

Furthermore,  Mr.  Beieko submitted that a valid decree of the Tribunal is also one that must bear the signatures of all the members who heard the appeal. The decree  in the  record  of appeal  only contained  the  signature of the Vice-Chairman. As the  record of appeal  must contain a decree, the one included was invalid for lack of the members' signatures. This rendered the purported  appeal  incompetent and  it ought to  be struck out with  costs.  He relied  on Mbeya  Intertrade  Company  Limited  v.  The  Commissioner General, Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  68 "A" of 2010 and SCB Tanzania Limited v. The Commissioner General of Tanzania Revenue  Authority, Civil Appeal No. 32 of 2007; and Ami Port Operations  (T)  Limited  v.  The  Commissioner for  Income Tax, Civil Appeal  No.  28 of 2005 (All CAT,  unreported).

Resisting, Mr. Ayoub  Mtafya, learned  Advocate  for  the appellant submitted that the words "Sgn" on the certified copy of the decision  meant that it was properly signed by the members. He pointed out that the decision was also signed by all the members as indicated in the stamp that was affixed on  it,  titled  "Certified  Copy  of the  Original  proceedings,  Judgment,  Ruling, Order"  which  beared  the  signatures  of  the  Vice-Chairman  and  the  two members who heard the appeal. That Rule 21 was complied with.

On the impugned decree,  Mr.  Mtafya  referring to section  25(1) of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal Act,  Cap.  408,  R.E.  2010  (the Act) and  Rule 24(1),  strenuously  submitted  that as  an  appeal  lies  to the  Court of Appeal against a  decision  or judgment of the Tribunal,  it was sufficient to  appeal only against a decision. There was, he contended, no requirement to appeal to the Court against a decree.  He submitted that Rule 21, strictly read, only covers a decision,  not a decree.  If the Rule had  intended to cover a decree, it should  have  clearly  said  so.  That  in Mbeya  Intertrade  Company Limited  case, the learned  Advocate  for  the  respondent  had  misled  the Court in  relying  on  Rule  21  and  importing  under  Rule  24(3),  the Appellate

Jurisdiction Act, Cap  141  R.E.  2002 and the Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009 the requirement that  a decree must be signed by the members.

In addition,  Mr.  Mtafya submitted that the decree was also valid under section  32(2)  and  (3)  of the Act,  because  it  had  the Tribunal's seal  affixed on  it,  which  authenticated and  rendered  it a valid  instrument.  He invited  us to dismiss the preliminary objection with costs.

*

The first issue to be resolved is whether the typed words " Sgrf' on the certified  copy of the  decision  are  sufficient to  constitute  a  signature  under Rule 21. The Black's Law Dictionary defines the word sign as:

"To identify (a record) by means of  a signature, mark or other symbol with intent to authenticate it as an act or a ■ judgment of  a person identifying it"; and

## a signature as:

"Any name, mark , or writing used with the intention of authenticating a document".

We would  agree  with  Mr.  Beleko  that  the  typed  words "Sgrf in  the record  of  appeal  in  themselves  could  not  constitute  a  signature  and  one which was capable of identifying their author or authenticating the decision concerned.  In our respectful view,  Rule 21 was  not complied with.

Second,  in  an  attempt to  scheme  around the  mandatory requirement of incorporating a decree in the record of appeal as an essential  document, Mr.  Mtafya  submitted that because section  25(1) of the Act and  Rule 24(1) grants  a  party  a  right  of  appeal  to  the  Court  against  a  decision  of  the Tribunal,  a  decree was  not an  essential  document  in  the  record  of appeal. With respect, this proposition is untenable. The Civil Procedure Code, Cap.33 R.E.  2002,  which  under  Rule  23(2)  mandatorily applies to the execution  of the decree or order of the Tribunal defines a decree in section 3 as:

"3 .   the formal  expression of  an adjudication which, so far as regards the court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of  the matters in controversy in the suit"

and a judgment as:

"the statement given by a Judge or a Magistrate of the grounds for a decree or order".

The Black's Law Dictionary, 9t h Ed;  defines a decision as:

"A   judicial or  agency determination after consideration of the facts and the law; esp) a ruling,  order or  judgment pronounced by a court when considering or disposing of a case",

*

## and an appellable decision as:

"A decree  or order  that is sufficiently final  to  receive appellate review.

Succinctly  put  by  B.M.  Prasad  and  M.  Mohan  in The  MU,  MANUAL OF THE CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE, Vol.  I,  15t h   Ed,  pp.  1630:

"a decision does not operate as a decree". ....................

" unless and until decree is formally drawn up in terms of the  Judgment, there  can  neither  be  an  appeal  nor execution".

In The Registered Trustees of the Mariam Faith Healing Centre @ WANAMAOMBIV. The Registered Trustees of the Catholic Church Sumbawanga Diocese, Civil Appeal No. 64 of 2007, (CAT, unreported) the Court had occassion to state:

"a decree constitutes the final  adjudication of  the matters in dispute whereas a  judgment is merely a statement of the reasons in support of the decree.

the  decree  and judgment are  composite documents which together constitute the adjudication of  the court. It is no wonder that nomally an appeal  lies against  a decree which is the formal adjudication of the court expressing it.  In this sence,  it is evident that the decree follows the judgment".

More  precisely, in Zepharia  Letashu  v  Moruo  Ndelamia, Civil Appeal  No.  31 of 1998,  (CAT,  unreported) the Court stated:

"A  decree is  a vital  and  central  part  o f  the record  o f  appeal since the appeal  is  granted  on it, hence its  absence is  fatal to the whole exercise".

All  considered,  in  our  respectful  view,  a  decree  remains  an  essential document in an appeal  emanating  from  the Tribunal  and  must be  brought on the record of the Court in a record of appeal as required by Rule 96(l)(h) and 96(2)(e) of the Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009.

Third,  Mr.  Mtafya  submitted that a  decree  issued  under  Rule  23(2)  is only for the  purpose of execution and  not for an  appeal.  With  respect,  this cannot  find  favour  with  us.  Rule  23(2)  does  not  limit  the  end  use  of the decree  by a party. No  doubt,  a  party  can  only  enforce  a  valid  decree. However,  a  plain  reading  of Rule  23(2)  shows that  it does  not  bar a  party from applying to the Tribunal for the issuance of a valid decree for an appeal or any other  purpose.  To say that it does,  is to  stretch  the  construction  of Rule 23(2) beyond its breaking point.

Fourth, in our considered view, section 32(2) and (3) of the Act cannot save the defective decree, signed only by the Vice-Chairman and not all the members. The  purported authentication  of the decree  by affixing  on  it the seal  of  the  Tribunal  cannot  validate  an  already  defective  decree.  Validity cannot be granted to what was already patently invalid in law.

For all  the  above  reasons and  going  by Midcom Tanzania  Limited v.  Commissioner General  (TRA),  Civil Appeal  No.  13 of 2011 (CAT, unreported)  and  Mbeya  Intertrade  Company  Ltd.  case, we  are constrained  to  find  the  decree  not  having  been  signed  by  all  members  of the  Tribunal,  defective.  This  renders  the  purported  appeal  incompetent. Accordingly, we proceed to strike it out with costs.

Ordered accordingly.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 23rd  day of February, 2016.
