## JUDGMENT OF KILEO. J. A.

(Under Rule 39 (3) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2009)

29th  February &amp; 05th   March, 2012

## KILEO, J. A.

On  10th   June  2004  the  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  who  is  the  present respondent,  filed  a  Bill  of  Costs  (Taxation  Cause  No.  13  of  2004)  in  the High  Court  pursuant to  Civil  Cause  No.  22  of  1998  of the  High  Court  of Tanzania, Arusha  Registry. The £illriwa$ filed three years and  nine  months from  the  date  costs  were  awarded.  Ar preliminary  objection  was  raised against the lodgment of the Bill on the ground that it was time barred. The Taxing  Master  upheld  the  preliminary  objection  and  dismissed  it  under

section  3  (1)  of the  Law of Limitation Act.  On  a  Reference to a judge, the Taxing Master's decision was reversed. In his ruling the judge stated:

"Taxation of costs is only a step towards enforcement of the entire judgment. It is dependent on the orders flowing from the  judgment It cannot stand independently. Upon finding that taxation complements  the judgment  and  or  decree,  Art. 20  of  the  1 st Schedule, Part  III of  the Law of  Limitation Act  is of  proper  application for the purposes of  computing limitation within which to process the bill  o f  costs.  The time  provided  for  under this  article is 12  years."

Following  the  finding  above  an  order  was  made  for  the  hearing  of  the 'application'  on  merit.  Being  dissatisfied  with  this  decision,  the  appellant, having obtained the requisite leave has come to this Court.

The appellant who is represented  by Mr.  Maro,  learned advocate  has filed the following two grounds of appeal:1

j

.

- 1.  That the High Court erred in law in treating as and holding that a Bill  o f  Costs constitutes an application for  execution.
- 2. That the High Court erred in law in holding that,  Taxation Cause No. 13 o f2004 was not time barred.

The respondent is represented by Dr. Angelo Mapunda, learned advocate.

The  bone of contention  in  this  appeal  centers  on  the question  whether a Bill of Costs filed in the High Court falls under item 20 or item 21 of Part III of  the  Schedule  to  the  Law  of limitation  Act. Supplementary  to  this

question is whether a  Bill of costs can be said to be an application so as to make  it fall  under  item  21  mentioned  above  in  view  of the  fact that the Advocates  Act  under  which  the  Bill  was  filed  does  not  provide  for  the period within which it has to be filed.

Mr.  Maro argued that the High (?ourt judge erred to treat a  Bill of Costs as an  application for enforcement of the decision  of the  High  Court.  He took us through a  number of writings and decisions in support of his argument to which we will  make referenced; we; may find  relevant in the discourse of this matter.

Submitting  before  the  Court,  Dr. Mapunda  pointed  out  that  there  are conflicting  decisions  in  the  High  Court with  regard  to the time  limit within which  a  Bill  of Costs  must  be  filed  ahd  he  called  upon  us  to  resolve  the conflict. The learned counsel agreed  that  a Bill of  Costs is not  an application for enforcement of a court's decree, judgment or order.  He also very kindly brought to the attention of,'the Court a decision of the Court by a single judge who held that a Bill of Costs had to be filed within sixty days of the date of the order for costs. The decisionEbeneza  Massawe vs. Permanent Secretary, Ministry . &lt; p f  Work and Another(Civil Application No  86  of  2006-  unreported)  concerned  a  Bill  of  Costs  in  the  Court  of Appeal.

Dr.  Mapunda also kindly brought to Court's attention the provisions of item 2  (2)  of the Third  Schedule to the Cpurt of Appeal  Rules which  enjoins a party to file a  Bill of Costs as soon practicable from the date of making the costs  or  within  21  days  after  a  request  in  writing  by  the  party  liable.

Despite  his  observations  the learned  counsel  wondered however  why execution of courts' decisions should  have a  shelf life of 12 years and the application for determination of a Bill of Costs only sixty days.  He asked the Court for guidelines.

Item 20 of Part III of the Schedule to the Law of limitation Act provides:

"20.  To  enforce  a  judgment,  decree  or  order  of  any  court where the period of limitation  is not provided for in this Act or any other written law ........................................................................... twelve years"

And item 21 provides

"21. Application under the Civil Procedure Code, the Magistrates'  Courts  Act  or  other  written  law  for  which  no period  of  limitation  is  provided  in  this  Act  or  any  other written law................. /.sixty days"

It is clear that item 20 provides for the time within which a decision of the Court has to be enforced. The question that must be answered  is whether the determination of a  Bill of costs can  be said to fall  under an application for enforcement of a court's decision.

The term 'enforce' in Black's Law Dictionary is defined as:

1 To  put into execution; to cause to take effect; to make effective, as, as to enforce a particular law, a writ, a  judgment, or the collection of . * ' .  ' ' a debt or fine, to compel opefiience to '

I do not think that a  Bill of Costs falls under enforcement.  Enforcement, in my  view  necessarily  connotes  that  something has  come  to  a  finale. Enforcement  stipulated under item 20 would involve applications for garnishee  orders,  attachment  gf  immpvable  or  movable  property,  arrest and detention in civil  prison etc.  On the other hand, when a  Bill of Costs is filed  in court hearing of the parties takes place and a finding is made. That finding  can  be  complained  against to  a  higher tribunal.  In Kalunga  and Company Advocates vs. National Bank of CommerceCivil Application  No  113  of  2003  (unreported)  a  single  judge  of  this  Court considered a Bill of Costs filed in the High Court to be an 'inquiry'. He found that an  appeal  against the decision of that inquiry required  leave in  terms of section  5  (1) of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act.  Going  by the definition of 'application' given in the Law of Limitation Act I would agree with  Mr.  Maro that it is wide enough to include the filing of a  Bill of Costs. 'Application' is defined as: * ^

## "application" means an application made to a court, which is of, or in relation to any proceeding of, a civil nature;"

&gt;/; ■ * A  Bill  of Costs  is  no doubt a  prdceeclifi§  of a  civil  nature.  It  involves,  as  I have  herein  before  stated,  the  hearing  of parties  and  a  determination  on the hearing. I am of the settled mind that a Bill of Costs does not fall under an application for enforcement of a court's decision.

Though the matter in  issue in the Ebeneza case supra ,was a  Bill  of Costs in the Court of Appeal, which set a time limit within which it had to be filed, by inference there also must be a time limit within which a  Bill  of Costs in the High Court has to be filed. ^ ' -v

B.  B.  Mitra  The  Limitation  Act  1963, twentieth  Edition  explains  that laws  of limitation  are founded  on  public  policy.  He  cites Halsbury'  Laws of England where the policy of Limitation Act is laid down as follows:

'The Courts have expressed  at  least three different reasons supporting  the  existence of statutes of limitation , namely,  (i)  that long dormant claims have more cruelty than  justice in them ; (ii) that a defendant might  have lost the evidence to dispute the stated claim ; (Hi)  that persons  with good causes of actions should pursue  them with reasonable diligence" (Ha/sbury's Laws of England, 4h  Ed. Vol.28p.266,para 605)'

Mitra also cites Andrew McGee in Limitation Periods (2n d  Edition 1994) wherein he states:

' ! Ar guments ' with regards  to the  policy  underlying  statutes  of li mitation fall into three main types. The first relates to the position of  the defendant  It  is  said to be unfair that  a defendant  should  have a claim hanging over hirrf for an indefinite period and it is in  this context that  such enactments are sometimes described  as ! statutes of peace'. The second looks at the matter from a more objective point of view. It suggests that a tirhe limit is necessary because with the lapse of time, proof  of  a claim becomes more difficult,  documentary evidence is likely to have been destroyed and memories of witnesses

r

will fade. The third relates to the conduct of the plaintiff,  it being thought right that  a person who does not  promptly act to enforce his rights should  lose them.  All these  justifications have been considered by the courts."

These are no doubt good principles froga'.which we can draw inspiration.

Mitra made the following observation to which I subscribe:-

"An unlimited and  perpetual threat of  litigation creates insecurity and uncertainty; some kind  of  limitation is essential  for  public order."

. a? As of now, as already stated above ,wlth the 2009 Court of Appeal Rules, a party is  required to file a  Bill  of costs as soon  as practicable. The  relevant provision which is item 2 (2) of the Third Schedule to the Tanzania Court of AppeaI Rules states: ^

- "  A  bill  of costs  shall  be  lodged  as  soon  as  practicable  after the  making  of the  order for  costs  or  not  later that  twentyone  days  after  a  request  in  writing  therefore  by  the  party liable, or such further time as the Registrar may allow."

I  take  inspiration  from  this  provision  to  underscore  my view  that a  Bill  of Costs  filed  under  the  Advocates  Act  in  the  High  Court  is  an  application falling  under  item  21  of  Part  III  of the  Schedule  to  the  Law  of  Limitation

Act. Its  shelf  life  cannot  therefore  be  the  same  as  an  application  for enforcement of a  court's  decision.  In  the  circumstances  it  ought  to  have been filed within sixty days of the date that the order for costs was made. As it is,  it was filed  over three years  later. The  learned Taxing  Master was therefore justified to dismiss it as it was barred by period of limitation.

Consequently,  I would allow the appeal with costs.  I would quash and set aside  the  decision  of  the  High-Court  sitting  on  reference  and  I  would restore the decision of the Taxing Master.
