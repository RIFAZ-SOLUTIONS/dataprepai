## KENTE. J.A.:

This is an  application  under rule  10 of the Tanzania  Court of Appeal Rules  2009  (hereinafter  the  Rules)  seeking  an  extension  of  time  within which  to  file  a memorandum  and  records  of  appeal  to  challenge  the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the TRAT) dated 30t h  March, 2021  in  appeal No. 11 of  2020.  The  notice  of  motion initiating this application  is  supported  by  an  affidavit  deponed  by  Mr.  Raymond  Wawa the applicant's counsel.

The gist of Mr. Wawa's averment is that, the applicant could not file the  memorandum  and  records  of appeal  in  time  because  of the  reasons which were beyond its control. According to Mr. Wawa, the applicant could not beat the deadline after the person to whom  it had taken the bundle  of documents  including the  pleadings and  proceedings  in  respect  of  the above  mention  appeal  for  purposes of photocopying  and  preparation of the  records of  appeal  was  taken ill and  diagnosed  with  covid-19  and subsequently gone missing only to resurface on  8t h  June,  2021 which was the  deadline  and  that  by  the  time  she  finished  photocopying the  bulky documents, the time within which to file the memorandum and  records of appeal  had  already  elapsed.  I  shall  get  down  to  the  nitty  gritty  of  Mr. Wawa's averments at a  later stage of this ruling.  In the meantime, I have found it apt  to highlight  the factual background  giving rise to  this application  as stated  by the applicant's counsel  in  his written  submissions and conceded by the respondent's counsel.

The applicant company  is a licenced transporter dealing with transportation  of  transit  goods.  On  various  dates  in  the  year  2016,  it entered  into  a  contract  with  one  F.  W. Wambua  a  Kenyan  national whereby the applicant undertook to carry  his goods identified  as assorted

beverages  (wines and  spirits)  which  were on  transit from  the  Republic of South Africa the country of origin, to the Republic of Kenya. The said goods were intended to exit the country through  Namanga  boarder.  However,  it was  alleged before  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board  (the  TRAB)  and subsequently before the TRAT  that, the respondent conducted an investigation which revealed that the said goods were illegally diverted into the Tanzanian local market. Upon mutual agreement, the said offence was compounded  and  the  applicant was  ordered  to  pay the  attendant  duties, and  penalty  and  its  business  licence  was  suspended.  This  gave  rise  to grievances which came to a crescendo with an appeal to the TRAB (Appeal No.  28  of  2018). However,  the  said  appeal  was  struck  out  for  some jurisdictional  reasons  raised  by the  respondent.  Dissatisfied,  the appellant vainly appealed  to the TRAT which  held, as did the TRAB that,  the  Board had no jurisdiction to determine the appeal preferred by the appellant.

The  applicant  company  which  had  yet  to  come  to  terms  with  the result of the compoundment order, sought to appeal to this Court. To that end, on 9t h  April,  2021  it promptly lodged a  notice of appeal  in terms Rule 83  (1)  of  the  Rules  and  served  its  copy  on  the  respondent  as  required under Rule 84 (1).  By virtue of Rule 91  (1), the applicant was supposed to

lodge the memorandum and record of appeal not later than 8th  June, 2021 but it could not do so hence the present application.

On this application for extension of time to file the memorandum and record  of appeal  out of time,  the  issue  is  mainly one. That  is whether or not, the applicant has furnished good cause in terms of rule 10 of the rules to  explain  away the  delay.  In  a  bid  to  account  for  the  delay,  Mr.  Wawa came up with the following averments as contained in paragraphs 29-31 of his affidavit reciting a litany of events.

- 29. That,  on  4t h   June,  2021  the  applicant  took  some  documents including pleadings and annextures totaling to about 400 pages to the secretarial bureau to get them photocopied, for preparation of  the records  of  appeal on  agreement  to  be collected in the evening but when they went to collect them the applicant found the bureau closed.
- 30.  That  the  secretarial  bureau  remained  closed  and  the  applicant could  not  trace  its  proprietor's  residence  until  8t h   June,  2021 when she showed up and claimed to have been sick for a week.
- 31.  That the moment she finished photocopying the documents, the time  within  which  to  lodge  the  record  and  memorandum  of appeal had already elapsed.

Expounding, Mr. Wawa  contended that, the proprietor of the secretarial  bureau  could  not  photocopy the documents  in  time  a  she  had contracted  covid-19  which  in  his  view,  constitutes  good  cause  to  account for the delay in terms of rule  10 of the Rules.  Asked why the  person who allegedly retained the applicant's documents could not swear an affidavit in support of his averments,  Mr.  Wawa  who  seemed  to  know  more than  he was letting  on,  claimed that,  she  had  refused and that on their part, they could  not  force  her  to  do  so.  Other  grounds  advanced  by  Mr.  Wawa  in support of the application were that:

- i) The intended appeal raises important points of law.
- ii)  The delay is not inordinate, and
- iii) The judgment  sought  to  be  challenged  on  appeal  is  fraught  with some material irregularities.

Among  other  authorities,  the  learned  counsel  relied  on  our  three decisions  in  the  cases  of Seif Store  Limited  v.  Zulfikar  H.  Karim,

Civil Application No. 181  of  2013, Mantrac  Tanzania  Limited  V. Raymond Costa, Civil Application  No.  1 1   of 2010 and National Bank of Commerce v. Alfred  S.  Mwita, Civil  Application  No.  226  of 2014 (all  unreported)  contending in  the  end  that,  the  case  under  scrutiny was a fit case for the Court to allow the application and enlarge  time as prayed for by the applicant.

In reply Mr. Leyan Sabore learned counsel appearing for the respondent was diametrically opposed to Mr. Wawa's contention regarding  indisposition  of the  proprietor of the secretarial  bureau.  With regard to the case of P.B.  Patel v. The Star Mineral Water and Ice Factory (Uganda)  Ltd (1961)  E.A.  454 which  Mr.  Wawa  relied on  in support of the position that, sickness has been considered to be a good cause  to  explain  away  the  delay  to  take  necessary  steps,  Mr.  Sabore submitted correctly so  in  my view that,  the evidence  presented to the Court  did not  prove  that  fact.  The learned  counsel  contended  for instance  that,  there  was  no  affidavit  by  the  said proprietor  of  the secretarial  bureau to support Mr. Wawa's averments that she  had  been indisposed  for  such  a period  as  not  to be  able  to photostat  the documents allegedly presented to her.  Moreover,  Mr.  Sabore could  not agree with  Mr. Wawa's contention that the said  proprietor  had  refused to swear an affidavit relating to her indisposition. On a further note,  Mr. Sabore  contended  that,  Mr.  Wawa  had  failed  to  attach  a  copy  of  a receipt to  his  affidavit  showing  that  indeed  the  applicant  had  paid  for the  alleged  secretarial  services.  With  regard  to  Mr.  Wawa's  contention that the  intended  appeal  raises  very  important  points  of  law  and  that the judgment of the TRAT is tainted  with  some  material  irregularities, Mr.  Sabore  submitted  very  briefly  that  there  is  no  irregularity  to  be rectified  by  this  Court  in  the  impugned judgement  of the TRAT. The learned  counsel  further  contended  that,  since  the  time  sought  to  be extended  has not been granted,  it was rather premature for this Court to discuss the question of irregularity of the judgment of the TRAT.

The learned counsel finally argued that, the application had no merit mainly because of the absence of the evidence  proving  indisposition of the  person  who  is alleged  to  have  retained  the  applicant's  documents. He thus prayed that the application be dismissed with costs.

It is trite  law that in terms of rule  10 of the Rules,  upon good cause being  shown,  this  Court  may extend the time  limited  by the  Rules  for the doing  of any act authorized  or  required  by the  Rules.  It is  as well

common ground that, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to the question as to what in law, constitutes good cause.

It is for that reason that in the case of Seif Store Limited (supra), we stated that:

"The interpretation of what constitutes good cause is  entirely  left  to  the  discretion  of the  court,  a subjective  approach.  However,  categories  of what constitutes a good cause are never dosed."

The ill-defined  nature of what constitutes "good cause" for purposes of extension of time is also reflected in our decision in the case of Geita Gold  Mining  Limited V. Twalib Ally Civil  Application  No.  14 of 2012 (unreported) to which we were referred by Mr. Wawa. Given the nature of the facts and circumstances obtaining in that case, we held that:

"Good cause may debatably be inferred from  the fact  that  the  applicant  has  a  statutory  right  of appeal whose enjoyment it has promptly begun to process."

Going  by the  above-cited  authorities and  many others,  it  stands  to reason that in application for extension of time, good cause depends on facts and  circumstances  of each  case.  It follows therefore  that,  in  any

application  for  extension  of time,  since  the  facts  of one  case  may  not necessarily  be the same as those obtaining  in  another case,  each case must be approached from its own facts which will determine the viability of the cause of delay furnished by the applicant as can be gauged from a  legal  standpoint.  The  decision  the court  will  ultimately  arrive  at,  will mainly be influenced by how it will interpret the facts and circumstances of each case.

I will  however say that, the law that is applicable to the instant case is  as  clear  as  stated  in  the  case  of Benedict  Kiwanga  v.  Principal Secretary  Ministry  of  Health, Civil Application No. 31 of 2000 (unreported) and many others. The stance of the law is that, where an affidavit mentions another person on a material point, that other person should  also  take  an  affidavit, (see  also  the  cases  of NBC  Ltd  v. Superdoll  Trailler  Manufacturing  Company  Ltd Civil Application No. 13 of 2002 and Franconia Investments Ltd v. TIB Development  Bank  Ltd Civil  Application  No.  270/1  of  2020  (both unreported).  Like in the last cited case,  I think that in the instant case, Mr. Wawa who is the applicant's advocate cannot purport to depose on another person's alleged illness and recovery from covid-19 without any

supporting  evidence  by way  of deposition from that person.  Nor can I accept Mr. Wawa's flimsy explanation that the said  person  had  refused to swear an affidavit in support of the claim of her alleged indisposition. I  therefore take it that the claim that the  person who was entrusted to photocopy the documents forming the record of appeal got sick as  not to be able to make the copies in time, was not established by evidence.

With  regard  to  the  allegation  that the  intended  appeal  raises  some important  points  of  law  and  that the  decision  by  the  TRAT  is  fraught with  some  material  irregularities,  I  am  not  satisfied  that,  that  is  the case,  if truth  be told.  With  due  respect,  I think the contention that the TRAT  decision  is  fraught  with  some  material  irregularities,  being  the applicant's last  remaining  holdouts,  was added to the application  as an afterthought. This is because, as I  see it and  as correctly submitted  by Mr.  Sabore,  there  is  nothing  suggesting,  albeit  prima  facie'  that  the decision made by the TRAT is suffering from any material irregularity or that the intended  appeal  raises any important question  of law worth of determination  by this Court. This,  in  my respectful view, is an assertion which may not only be premature but also wholly untenable.

In the ultimate event and upon considering the submissions made by both  counsel  in  this application,  I  am  of the view that,  no  good  cause has  been  shown  upon  which  I  can  exercise  the  discretionary  powers bestowed on  this  Court  in  terms  of rule  10  of the  rules to  extend  the time within which the applicant may file the record and memorandum of appeal.

I accordingly dismiss the application with costs.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 15t h  day of December, 2022.
