## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

15:';  &amp; 29b : February,  2016

## MUGASKA, 3.A-:

The  appellant  BP  Tanzania  Ltd  is  a  licensed  oi!  company  which markets  and  distributes  petroleum  products.  On  24t n   November,  2009, the Respondent's Large Tax Payers Department conducted a tax audit on the appellant. The audit covered among other things, withholding tax for the  financial  years  2007  to  2008 regarding  payments  made  by  the appellant to  non-resident companies  in  respect of services  rendered  to her.

Payments  were  made  to  BP  International  and BP  South  Africa as follows:-

- 1.  ISP  Global  Charges  in  respect  of  Accounting  Package  that was used by BP globally which had the server in London and the  appellant's  employees  accessed  the  server  by  using  a pass word and a satellite dish supplied by a local provider.
- 2.  Application System Support based and provided by BP South Africa whereby, in case of  any technical difficulty the appellant's  employee  would  make  a  phone  call  to  South Africa and be assisted on how to sort out the problem.
- 3.  Application System Licenses fees paid to suppliers of accounting  packages  installed  in  the  sen/er  in  London  and were  accessed  by the  appellant  using  a  satellite  dish  from Dar- es- Salaam.
- 4.  Information  technology  service  fees to the  BP  International internet system which has a server in London and accessible to BP employees worldwide.

Also the appellant paid consulting  professional fees to AON  South Africa which  availed  the  appellant  support  in respect  of  a  Fund  to  which employees  were  contributing  their  salaries.  The  Fund  was  managed  in

South Africa  and on  monthly basis the  Fund would  send  emails to AON South Africa to do the accounting of the Fund.

Pursuant to the  2007 - 2008  audit exercise,  the  respondent concluded that,  the  appellant  had  withholding  tax  liability  of Tshs.  477,776,665/= constituting  principal tax liability of Tshs.  340,041,024/=  and  interest of Tshs.  137,735,641/=.  The  appellant was  issued  with  a  withholding Tax Certificate/Interest number WHT/MAT/4/9/10 thereupon the respondent demanded the respective withholding tax be paid by the appellant.

The appellant challenged the demand to the withholding tax liability on ground  that,  services  were  rendered  by  non-resident  companies  and payment effected  by  the  appellant  was  not  subject  to  withholding  tax because payments and the services in question were on licence fees and sourced  outside Tanzania. The appellant was  not successful  in  both the Tax Appeals Board  (The  Board)  and  the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal (The Tribunal) hence this appeal with following grounds:-

- a) That the Tribunal erred by deciding that  services rendered by  ISP Global  Charges,  Application  System  Support;  Application  System licenses;  IT  Service  Fees  and  Other  Consulting  Professional  fees are royalties and subject to the provisions of section 69 (e) of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

- b) In the  alternative  and without  prejudice, if the charges  are royalties  under  the  terms  of  Income  Tax  Act,  2004,  then  the Tribunal  erred  by  deciding  that  the  said  payments  were  made  in respect of assets in the United Republic of Tanzania.

The appellant was represented by Ms.  Fatuma  Karume,  learned counsel whereas Mr. Salim Beleko, learned counsel represented the Respondent.

The hearing of the appeal was preceded by a preliminary objection raised  by  the  respondent  on  the  competence  of the  appeal  on  ground that,  the  record  of appeal  is  accompanied  by  defective  Judgment  and Decree not signed and certified by the members of the Tribunal contrary to  rule  21  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals  Rules,  2001  (GN.  58  of 2001). (Tax Appeals Rules).

Arguing  the  preliminary objection,  Mr.  Beleko  submitted  that,  the Judgment of the Tribunal  appearing at page 342 of the record  was  not signed  by all  the  members.  However,  he  did  not make any submission on the defect in the Decree as reiterated in the notice of the Preliminary Objection.  He  urged  the  Court to  strike  out the  appeal  because  it  was incompetent.

On the other hand, Ms. Karume challenged the Preliminary Objection  arguing that,  Rule  21  of the Tax Appeals  Rules was complied with  because  the  original  Judgment  of  the  Tribunal  was  signed  and certified by all  its members. As such, she urged the Court to dismiss the preliminary objection with costs.

Rule 21 (1) of the Tax Appeals Rules, provides as follows:­

"  After  the  conclusion  o f the  hearing  of the  evidence  and submissions of the parties the  Tribunal shall\  as soon as is practicable, make a decision in the presence of  the parties or their advocates  or representatives and shall  cause  a  copy dully signed and certified by members of the  Tribunal which heard  the  appeal  to  be  served  on each  party  to the proceeding".

In  terms of the cited  Rule,  the decision  of the Tribunal  must be signed and certified  by all  members.  In the matter at hand, at page 342 of the record  is  the  last  page  of the  Tribunals' Judgement  dated  18/02/2015 with abbreviation 'Sgd' beside the name and the title of each member of the Tribunal  who are:  H.  M.  Mataka Vice Chairman,  Mr.  W.  Ndyetabula, and Prof. J.  Doriye. The decision was on  11/3/2015 certified by the same members. The Decree was signed by all the members but not certified.

It  is  our  considered  view  that,  the  certification  of the judgment  of the Tribunal  by  all  members  of the  Tribunal,  signifies  that  those  members did  authenticate  the  decision  delivered  on  18/02/2015  while the decree bears signatures of all the Tribunal Members. As such, rule 21 (1) GN. 56 of  2001  was  substantially  complied  with.  If the  Judgment  and  Decree were  not  entirely  signed  by  the  members,  that  would  have  been  a serious omission impacting on validity and authenticity of the decision of the Tribunal. In this regard, we are satisfied that the competence of the appeal is not affected and we dismiss the preliminary point of objection.

Reverting to the substantive appeal, adopting what she submitted before the  Tribunal,  Ms.  Karume  stated  that,  the  obligation  on  a  resident  tax payer  to  withhold  tax  is  provided  under  sections  81  to  83  of  the  of Income Tax Act,  2004 and  as specified  in  the schedule to the Act.  She argued that, in terms of the law four conditions must be satisfied before imposing liability to withhold tax:-

- a.  The tax payer must be a resident person.
- b.  The  payment must be dividend,  interest,  natural  resource payments, rent, royalty or a retirement payment made by an approved retirement Fund.

- c.  The payment must have a source in the United  Republic of Tanzania, and
- d. The payment is not one which is excluded in terms of section 82 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

She  further  submitted  that,  services  rendered  to  the  appellant  by  the nonresident companies do  not have  a  source  in  the  United  Republic of Tanzania  and  as  such,  the  appellant  was  not  obliged  to  withhold  tax when she made payments for the respective services.

Relying  on  section  69  (e)  of the  Income Tax Act,  ( supra ),  Ms.  Karume was of the view that, as long as the services were rendered from London and  South  Africa  where  servers/assets  are  located,  the  appellant  could not in the course  of  making payments  withhold tax because  the appellant  did not  use  an  asset  situated in the United Republic  of Tanzania.  In this regard,  Ms.  Karume argued that, the Tribunal erred to decide  that  the  asset  is  BP  Tanzania  (the  appellant  on  which  services were rendered).

Regarding other Consulting Professional Fees, Ms. Karume submitted  that,  the Tribunal  erred  to  dismiss  the  entire  appeal  despite deliberating  that,  the  appellant  was  not  obliged  to  withhold  tax  on consulting  Professional  fees  on  the  Provident  Fund  of  BP  employees managed  in  South  Africa  which  was  conceded  by  the  respondent's official.

On the other  hand,  Mr.  Beleko challenged the appeal  and  argued the two  grounds  together. He submitted that, the appellant was rendered services from  BP International and  BP South Africa and that is why  she  was  charged  royalty  for  using  and  enjoying  services  of  the nonresident companies. Thus, in terms of section 82 (1) (c) the appellant was an agent and ought to have withheld  money on  payment made to foreign  companies  for  services  rendered  to  her  in  Tanzania.  He  added that,  in  the  event the  appellant  did  not withhold  tax,  she  is  obliged  to pay the withheld tax from payments made for services consumed by the appellant while in the United Republic of Tanzania.  Mr.  Beleko urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  rejoinder,  Ms.  Karume  reiterated  that,  under  section  69  (e)  of the  Income  Tax  Act  requires that,  the  asset from  which  the  service  is sourced must be situated in Tanzania and not otherwise.

The  issues for determination  are whether  payment  by the  appellant to non-resident  companies  for  services  rendered  to  her  is  royalty  and  if such payment has a source in the United Republic.

In  the  United  Republic of Tanzania,  the obligation to  pay tax is a creature  of section  6  (1)  (a)  (b)  of the  Income  Tax  Act  (supra)  which states:-

- "....6 (l)-Subject to  the  provisions  of subsection  (2),  the chargeable income of a person for the year of income from any employment, business or investment shall be:
- (a) in  the  case  o f a  resident person,  the persons income from employment , business or investment for the year of income irrespective of  the source of  income; and
- (b) in  the  case  o f a  non-resident person,  the person's income from  employment,  business  or investment for  the  year  of income, but only to the extent that the income has a source in the United Republic...."

According  to  the  cited  provision,  a  non-resident  person  can  be charged tax from an undertaking  provided that the income has a source in the United Republic. Section 69 of the Income Tax Act (supra), defines and enlists what constitutes payments that have a  source in the United Republic.  The  relevant  provision  in  our  case  is  section  69(e)  which states:

The following  payments  have  a  source  in the United Republic of Tanzania:

- (a) ......... not applicable;
- (b) .not applicable;
- (c) not applicable;
- (d) not applicable;
- (e) Royalties paid for the use of, right to use or forbearance from using an asset in the United Republic".

Section  3   of  the  Income  Tax  Act,  2004,  which  is  the  interpretation provision defines words 'royalty' as follows:-

'Royalty' means any payment made by the lessee under a lease of  an intangible asset and includes payment for:-

(a)  The  use  of,  or  the  right  to  use,  a  copyright,  patent, design, model, plan, secret formula or  process or trade mark; (b) The supply of  know how including information concerning industrial, commercial or  scientific equipment or experience; (c) the use of,  or right to use, a cinematography film,  video tape, sound recording or any other like medium;

- (d)  The  use  of,  or  right  to  use' ,   industrial, commercial or scientific equipment;
- (e)  The supply of  assistance ancillary to a matter referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d);
- (f)  A  total  or partial forbearance  with  respect to  a  matter referred to in paragraphs (a) to (e).

But excludes a natural resource payment;"

A similar definition of royalty is found in Royalties Article 12 of July, 2008 Edition of the UN Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation  (OECD)  Model  Convention  on  Income  and  on  Capital  as follows:-

"The term  'royalties'...  means payments of  any kind received as  consideration  for  the  use  of,  or  the  right  to  use,  any copyright  of  literary, artistic  or  scientific work  including cinematograph  films, any  patent, trade  mark, design  or model,  plan,  secret formula  or process,  or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience".

In  the  Indian  case  of CIT vs AHMEDABAD MANUFACTURING AND CALICO PRINTING CO (1983) 139 ITR 806, royalty is defined as:

"A sum payable for the right to use some else's property/  asset for the purpose of  gain ."

In a nutshell, royalty is a payment for the use of or the right to use something  that  does  not  belong  to  the  payer  and  this  may  well relate  to  the  right  to  use  intangible  property  as  defined  under section 3 of the Income Tax Act {supra).

In the matter at hand, except for the professional consulting professional fees, in terms of sections 3  and 69(e) of the Income Tax Act {supra) the appellant  who  is  the  resident  tax  payer  in  the  United  Republic  paid royalty to foreign companies which rendered services to the appellant.

The contentious  remaining  issue  is  whether the  royalty  payment  has a source in the United Republic so as to attract withholding tax as claimed by the respondent.

In an article titled International TaxationRoyalty  and  Fees  for Technical Services by Chhaya  Desai, discusses sections  5  and  9  of the  India  Income  Tax  on  the  overall  taxability  under  domestic  law  in that, nonresidents are liable to tax on:

- (a) income received or deemed to be received in India, and

- (b) Income which accrues or arises or deemed to accrue or arise in India.

Furthermore,  income  by  way  of  Fees  for  Technical  services  would  be taxable  in  India  if payable  to  the  non-resident.  This  position  is  further clarified  in   an  Article  by  Deloitte  Internationa!  on  Positive  Developments for corporate withholding Tax in India which states:

"When  a  nonresident company provides services to  a  local company,  the invoiced amount will often be subject to a tax withholding applied at source by the customer. This withholding is the remitted to the local tax authorities ........ "

The taxability of technical,  managerial or consulting services provided by foreign companies to the Indian  clients performed outside India was an issue  before  the  Supreme Court of India  in  the case  of Ishikawajima Harima Heavy Industries (288 ITR 408).

Foreign Companies were taking a stand that such services should not be taxable  in  India,  since  they  were  not  performed  in  India  and  had  no territorial nexus with India. The apex Court held that:-

"Services should be  rendered as  well as  used in  India  for being taxed in India.  If both conditions are not fulfilled'f  the

fees for the  technical services are not chargeable  to  tax in India."

The  exemption  to  charge  withholding  tax  in  India  is  where  there  is  a Treaty with the Country where the foreign companies are resident.

In in  Kenya,  Royalties if paid to a  nonresident are subject to withholding tax of 20% (Delloitte International).

Thus,  in  a  nutshell;  payment of royalty to a  nonresident and  subjecting the  same  to  withholding  tax  is  a  well-established  phenomenon  at  the global  level  in  a  specified  legal  framework.  We  have  deliberately  cited some  examples  to  amplify  that  subjecting payment  of  royalties  to withholding  tax for the obvious reason  of ensuring that income derived from  business  is  taxed  at  the  source  and  the  Local  Tax  Collection Authority imposes and collects the requisite taxes and that this issue is a global issue.

In the United Republic of Tanzania, such practice is structured in statute whereby royalty and technical service fee paid to non-residents is subject to  withholding  tax  if the  payment  is  sourced  in  the  United  Republic of Tanzania.  This  is  pursuant to  sections 82  (1)  (a)  and  83  (1)  (b)  of the Income Tax Act,  2004.  Similarly,  the duty  is imposed  on  a  resident tax

payer  to  withhold  tax  under  sections  82(1)  (b)  and  83  (1)  (b)  of the Income Tax Act, 2004 at a rate specified in the First Schedule to the Act.

There  is  no  dispute  that,  the  servers  of  non-resident  companies  which rendered  services to the appellant are  physically located  in  London  and the  Republic  of  South  Africa.  The  appellant  accessed  and  enjoyed  the requisite services while in Tanzania.

The  contentious  issue  is  that  since  the  servers/assets  are  not  in  the United Republic, Ms.  Karume argues that imposition of withholding tax is not according to the  law.  With  due respect,  the contention  put forward by  Ms.  Karume  that  because  the  servers/assets  are  not  in  the  United Republic no withholding tax is payable has no legal basis.

Like  it  was  the  case  in  the  Tax  Appeals  Board  and  the  Tax  Appeals Tribunal,  before  us,  Ms.  Karume  reiterated  that,  the  interpretation  of section  69  (e) of the Income Tax Act is to the effect that servers ought to have been situated in the United Republic so as to attract withholding tax when paying for service rendered by the non-residents companies.

Ms.  Karume  repeated  what  she  submitted  in  the  Tribunal  as  to  what constituted  true  construction  of  section  69(e)  of  the  Income  Tax  Act (supra).  It is  imperative to  reproduce what is contained  at page  237 of the record:-

"Section 69(e) of the Income Tax Act 2004, does not contain the word "situated in"but in its true construction/meaning the section means  "withholding tax is due on royalties paid for  the  use  of,  right to  use  or forbearance  from  using  an asset inside  or  within the  United  Republic" and  clearly there  is  little  difference  in  the  English  language  between saying that an asset is in the United Republic; or an asset is inside  the  United Republic;  or an asset is  within  the  United Republic or an asset is situated in the United Republic".

Having  carefully examined  section  69  (e)  of the  Income Tax Act,  2004 and the couched immediate quoted submission, we are not in agreement with the interpretation given  by Ms.  Karume for what will  be unveiled in the due course.

For the  sake  of clarity,  it is  imperative  to  make  a  comparison  of items which  under section  69(1)  (a)  to  (e)  constitute  payments which  have a source in the United Republic to see if the word 'situated' which does not appear in section 69 (e) was intended or it was deliberately omitted for a purpose.

"The following payments have a source in the United Republic of Tanzania:-

- ( ) 3 Dividends paid by a resident corporation;
- (b) Interest paid by a resident person or domestic permanent establishment;
- (c)Natural resource payments made in respect of or calculated by reference to natural resources taken from land or the sea situated in  the  United Republic of Tanzania  or its territorial waters;
- (d) Rent paid for the use of, right to use or forbearance from using an asset situated in the United  Republic;
- (e) Royalties paid for  use  of,  right  to  use  or  forbearance from using an asset in the United Republic of Tanzania;"

As  the  word  "situated"  is  not  in  section  69(e)  as  presupposed  by  Ms. Karume,  the  physical  presence  of  the  servers  or  assets  in  the  United Republic is not necessary for payment to access right to use to quality as sourced in the United Republic.

In REPUBLIC  VERSUS  MWESIGE  GEOFREY  AND  ANOTHER, CRIMINAL APPEAL NO 355 OF 2014 (Unreported)  when  discussing the  familiar  canon of  statutory  construction  this  Court  quoted  with approval the decisions of the US Supreme Court as follows:

## In CONSUMER  PRODUCTS SAFETY COMMISSION  et.ai  V  GTE

SLYVANIA, Inc. et. A! 227 U.S. 102 (1980); "with the familiar canon of statutory construction the starting  point for interpreting the statute  is the language of  the statute itself. Absenting a clearly expressed legislative  intention  to  the  contrary,  that  language  must  ordinarily  be regarded as conclusive" The same Court went further and  held that it a statute's language is plain and clear"

"the duty of  interpretation does not arise and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion".

In CAMINETTI V.  UNITED STATES, 242 U.S 470 (1917) the court categorically ruled that:

"It is elementary that the meaning of a statute must in  the first instance ; be sought in  the  language  which  the  act is framed, and if  it is plain ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms

## In REPUBLIC  VERSUS  MWESIGE  GEOFREY AND  ANOTHER, this

Court ruled that:  when the words of a statute are unambiguous," judicial inquiry is complete" there is no need for interpolations, lest we stray into the exclusive  preserve of the  legislature  under the  cloak of overzealous interpretation. This because:-

"courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute  what it means  and  means  in  a  statute  what  it  says: CONNECTICUT NAT'L BANK v GERMAIN, 112 s. Ct 1146, 1149 (1992).

In  the  light  of cited  decisions,  section  69  (e)  does  not  require  physical presence of the  non-resident service provider in the United  Republic.  In our  considered  view,  in  section  69(e)  the  word 'situated' was  not intended  and  that  is  why  it  is  not  in  that  provision.  The  word  situated was  intended  in  69(c)  and  (d)  and  that  is why  it  is  expressly  stated  in that  provision.  The  wording  of  section  69  (1)  (e)  lists  down  services obtained  from  outside  and  utilised  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania which requires the user to pay for the use did  not envisage the physical presence  of the  service  provider  as  an  asset  in  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania. What is required to be proved is use of, or the right to use the software  including  the  grant  of  a  licence  irrespective  of  whether  any right or property is located in the United Republic.

In  the  premises,  the  focus  in  the  construction  of  section  69(e)  of the Income Tax Act {supra) is whether the payment of a royalty was for the purposes  of  business,  or  earning  any  income  from  any  source  in  the United  Republic or services are  utilized  in Tanzania.  The  moment these

conditions  are met, irrespective  of  whether  payment  is  done  by  a resident  or  non-resident,  the  income  would  be  taxable  in  the  United Republic, Also irrespective of the place of rendering services, if utilized in United  Republic shall  be taxable in the  United  Republic.  Besides,  royalty is payable for the right to use someone else's property for the purpose of gain  as  reiterated CIT  vs  AHMEDABAD  MANUFACTURING  AND CALICO PRINTING CO. (1983) 139 ITR 806.

The word "situated" as  solicited  by  Ms.  Karume  is  indeed  contrary to the  interpretation  of Tax  Legislation  which  requires Tax  Law to  be  read as it is and one should not attempt to smuggle in the words not intended to  avoid  setting  dangerous  precedents.  In  the  premises,  the  Tribunal erred to determine that the asset in question for the purposes of section 69(1)  (e)  is  BP  Tanzania  (the  appellant  company).  The  assets  in  the context  of the  law  are  servers  in  Britain  and  Republic  of  South  Africa where  nonresident  companies  are  located  from  which  the  appellant accessed and enjoyed services in the United Republic to do his business.

In  the  premises,  we are satisfied  that,  the appellant made  payments of royalty  to  BP  International  and  BP  South  Africa  have  a  source  in  the United Republic and as such, the appellant ought to have withheld tax of

in  the  financial  years  2007  to  2008  in  respect  of  ISP  Global  Charges; Application  System Support; Application System  Licences and IT Service Fees.  As the appellant did  not withhold tax he must pay the unwithheld tax.

Regarding  payments  for  other  consulting  professional  fees,  the  non­ payment of the withholding tax it was not contested  by the respondent as  correctly  deliberated by  the  Tribunal but  had  the  entire  appeal dismissed.  Considering that, the Provident Fund to which the employees made contributions was  managed  in  South  Africa  where the  consulting professional services  were rendered  then; the  withholding  tax  was wrongly demanded.

Therefore,  the grounds that payments  by the appellant to  non-resident companies were not subject to withholding tax because the payments for the  services  in  question  were  sourced  outside  the  United  Republic and on licence fees is not merited are hereby dismissed.

Another issue is in  respect of the withholding of the BP Provident Fund. As  correctly  submitted  by  Ms.  Karume  in  her  submission  before  the Appellate Tribunal, it is true that the Tanzania Revenue Authority did not dispute  that  it  was  not  correct  to  withhold  tax  in  respect  of  the  BP Provident Fund.

before the Appellate Tax Tribunal,  the  Provident Fund  is a  collection  of employees' money for the welfare of the employees.  Normally, Provident Funds  is  a  portion  channeled  for  employees'  benefits  after  taxing  the employee's  basic  salary.  In  other  words,  a  remittance  to  the  Provident Fund  arises  after  the  basic  salary  is  taxed.  Even  though  the  money accumulated in the Provident Fund may be invested elsewhere, the right to impose tax only arises at the point when such investment is landed in the  United  Republic  or  rather  revolves  within  the  United  Republic  as  a royalty in respect  of  payments  which  have  a  source  in  the  United Republic.  In  the  event this  issue was conceded  by the  respondent,  the dismissed  ground  of  appeal  succeeds  to  that  extent  in  the  interest  of justice.

It  is  in   that  ground  we  hold  improper to withhold  tax  in  respect of the Provident  Fund.  Such  ground  dismissed  by  the  Appellate  Tax  Tribunal succeeds  to  that  extent  in  the  interest  of  justice. In view  of  the aforesaid, we partly allow the appeal.

Payments by the appellant to BP International and BP South Africa have a  source  in  the  United  Republic  and  are  subject  to  withholding  tax payable  in  the  United  Republic.  As  such,  the  appellant  must  pay  the

withheld  tax  of  in  the  financial  years  2007  to  2008  in  respect  of  ISP Globa! Charges; Application System Support; Application System Licences and IT Service  Fees, The two grounds of appeal  raised by the appellant are hereby dismissed.
