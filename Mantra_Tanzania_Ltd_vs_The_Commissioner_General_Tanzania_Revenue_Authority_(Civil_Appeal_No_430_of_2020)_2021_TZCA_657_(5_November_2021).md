## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

27:  '  October, 2021 &amp; 5t h  November, 2021

## MAIGE, J.A.:

The appeal at hand seeks to fault the decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal  (the  Tribunal)  in  Tax  Appeal  No.  2  of  2019.  In  the  said decision, the Tribunal confirmed the decision of the Tax Appeals Board (the  Board)  to  the  effect  that,  payment  for  service  rendered  to  the appellant  by  non-resident  service  providers  had its  source  in  the United Republic of Tanzania and thus liable for withholding taxes and that; the rule against double taxation stipulated under  Article 7 of the Double  Taxation  Agreement  (the  DTA)  between  South  Africa  and

Tanzania  was  inapplicable  in  so  far  as  the  withholding  taxes  were deducted on payments in respect of business transactions as opposed to business profits.

In  order to  appreciate the  nature  of the  contention,  we find  it useful to narrate, albeit briefly, the factual  materials underpinning the background of this appeal. The appellant is a  company duly existing under the laws of Tanzania.  Its area of business operation  is mineral exploration. In carrying out  its business,  the  appellant  procured services from non-resident service providers mostly from South Africa. It  is  not  in  dispute  that,  under  Article  7  of  the  DTA,  profits  of  an enterprise in the contracting states are only taxable if the business is carried  out  in  the  respective  contracting  state  through  a  permanent establishment.

On  31s t   July, 2014,  the  appellant  wrote  to  the  respondent requesting  for  a  refund  of  withholding  taxes  of  USD  1,450,920.00 incorrectly  paid  in  relation  to  services  that  were  performed  outside Tanzania  by  non-  resident service  providers  for  the  period  between July, 2009  and  December,  2012.  The  appellant  alleged  that,  the services in question were not liable for withholding taxes because they

wore not rendered in the United Republic of Tanzania and further that, the service  providers  being  residents of the Republic of South Africa, were  exempted  under Article  7  of the  DTA  from  paying  taxes.  The respondent  refused  the  request  maintaining  that,  the  services  in question  were  rendered  in  Tanzania  and  Article  7  of  the  DTA  was irrelevant  in  as  much  as  it  was  limited  to  business  profits  and  not business transactions.

The  appellant  was  unhappy  with  that  decision  and  therefore, appealed  to  the  Board  on  two  grounds. First, the  imposition  of withholding tax was in violation of the provisions of sections 6(l)(b), 69(i) (i) and 83 of the Income Tax Act, Cap. 332 [R.E. 2019], (the Act). Second, the assessment of the withholding tax on services performed in South Africa by South African entities was in breach of the provisions of the DTA. The Board, guided  by our authority in Tullow Tanzania BV v. Commissioner General Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil Appeal  No.  24  of 2018  (unreported),  made  the  following  statement and proceeded to dismiss the appeal

"In terms of  the above holding of  the Court of Appealin a matter  similar to the one before us ,  we are entitled to hold as we hereby do that,

payment for services rendered in  the matter before us had  sources in the United  Republic of Tanzania ; thus, the  first  issue  receives  an answer in the affirmative that,  withholding tax was  payable given the fact that the withholding agent withholds tax on business transactions, we do not find that Article 7 of  the DTA  would apply in the circumstances of  this case".

Being  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  the  Board,  the  appellant unsuccessfully  appealed  to  the Tribunal.  In  determining  the  appeal, the Tribunal  was  guided  by two  issues.  First,  what  does  the  clause "service rendered"  in section 69(i) (i) of the Act means in  determining if payment has its source in the United Republic of Tanzania. Second, what is the correct interpretation of Article 7 of the DTA. In addressing the first  issue,  the Tribunal,  while  noting  the  existence  of conflicting opinions of the Court on the issue in its decision in the Commissioner General,  TRA  v.  Pan  African  Energy  Tanzania  Limited, Civil Appeal  No.  146  of 2015  (unreported)  on  the  one  hand  and Tullow Tanzania BV {supra) which was also followed in Shell Deep Water Tanzania  BV v.  the  Commissioner General  (TRA), Civil  Appeal No.  123  of  2018  and Commissioner General  (TRA)  v.  Aggreko

International  Projects  Ltd, Civil  Appeal  No. 148  of  2018,  both unreported  on the other,  opted  to follow the  latter decision for the reason that it was based on the modern view approach of construing provisions which, like the instant one, deal with anti- tax avoidance.

On the second issue, it was the opinion of the Tribunal that, as the  DTA  provides  for  tax  exemption  treatment  of  various  specified transactions and exclude from exemption those which are not covered, the  withholding  taxes  under  discussion  being  in  respect of business transactions,  the  clause  which  is  not covered  in  the  exemption,  was subject to taxation. In particular it stated as follows:-

"From the foregoing Article 20 quoted above, we  find  the argument  by  the  appellant's counsel that the amount (payment of service fee) is exempted  from  any  tax  including withholding tax in Tanzania to have no merit  at all.  We therefore uphold  the decision of  the trial Board in respect of this ground of appeal and dismiss it"

Still  aggrieved,  the appellant lodged the  instant appeal  faulting the decision of the Tribunal on the following grounds:-

- 1. That  the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal grossly  erred  in  law  by  holding  that  the Board was correct in holding that  payments for services rendered/  performed abroad by non-resident suppliers had a source in  the United Republic of Tanzania;
- 2.  That  the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal grossly erred in law by holding that  Article 7 of  the Double Taxation Agreement does not apply on the Appellant's case; and
- 3.  That  the Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal erred in law by holding that the Appellant was not  justified to claim refund of incorrectly  paid withholding tax.

In the conduct  of  this appeal, Dr. Abel Mwiburi and Mr. Rwekamwa  Rweikiza, both learned advocates, appeared  for  the appellant whereas Messrs. Cherubin Chuwa and Harold Gugami, both learned Senior State Attorneys, joined forces to represent  the respondent. As it is the procedure, each of the parties had, before the date of hearing, filed written submissions which are on the record. In their  oral  submissions  supplementing  the  written  submissions  which

for the appellant was made by Dr.  Mwiburi and for the respondent by Mr.  Chuwa,  each  of the  parties  fully  adopted  its  respective  written submissions to read as part of the oral submission. We commend both counsel for their well -focused and instructive submissions which have been extremely useful in composing  this judgment.

In  support  of the  first  ground  of appeal,  Dr.  Mwiburi  had  his starting  point  on  section  6(1)  (b)  of  the  Act  which  obliges  a  nonÂ­ resident to  pay tax  if only the  payment in  question  has  its source  in the United  Republic of Tanzania. The criteria for establishing  source of  income,  the  counsel  submitted,  is  if  the  respective  service  was rendered in Tanzania. Reference was made to the provisions of section 69 (i) (i) of the Act read together with section 83(i) (b) thereof. He therefore,  faulted the  Tribunal  in  basing  its  decision  on  place  of utilization  rather  than  of  performance as  the  basis  for  determining source of income. As the words of the statutes clearly stipulate place of  performance  as  the  basis  of determination,  it  was  wrong  for the Tribunal to  use the purposive  approach and thereby implying that, the  intention  was  the  place  of  utilization  of the  service,  he  further submitted.  In  his  view,  this  being  a  tax  dispute,  the  Tribunal  was

expected  to  use  strict  rule  of  interpretation.  The  counsel placed reliance on the English authority in Cape Brandy Syndicate vs. IRC [1921] 1   KB 64 which is in support of that proposition.

The counsel  did not agree with the Tribunal's  conceptualization of the phrase "render"  to mean "deliver." He, to the contrary, equated it with the phrase "perform."  He substantiated  his contention with the definition of the respective term  in the Black's Law Dictionary as well as the definition of the term "perform" in section 2 of the Interpretation of  Laws  Act,  Cap.  1   [R.E.,  2019]. In  his  conclusion  therefore,  the clause "  services  fees  attributed  to  service  rendered  in  the  United Republic  of  Tanzania" means  "  services  performed  in  the  United Republic of Tanzania".  The counsel supported  his contention with the Indian authority in Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy  Industries Limited  vs.  Director  of  Income  Tax (288  ITR  408)  where  the Supreme Court of India observed:

"For  purposes of  section 9(i) (VII) of  TTAA, the service must not only be utilized in India , they must also be rendered  in India so that  all  of  the income from fees become taxable in India.  The law  in  India was  changed  in  April  2010\

whereby after  the  amendment,  service  fees paid to non-residents for service utilized (without necessarily being performed in India) in  India  were  deemed  to  have  a  source  in India."

In Tanzania,  he submitted, the scope of the application of  the respective  provision  was  made  clear  in  the  case  of Commissioner General (TRA) vs. Pan African Energy Tanzania Limited (supra) where it was held that, a private company has no obligation to withhold tax where the service fee paid is for service rendered outside Tanzania.

Remarking  on  the  recent  position  in Tullow  Tanzania  BV (supra), it was his humble submission that, the said decision and the subsequent decisions which followed it, is  bad in law for overstepping the intention of the legislature by implying what was not intended. In any  event,  he  submitted,  the  said  decisions  did  not  overrule  the authority in Pan African Energy  Tanzania Limited (supra).

On  the  second  ground,  the  counsel  faulted  the  Tribunal  in distinguishing between  business  profits  and  business  transactions without taking  into account that withholding tax is in  law part of the income tax.  He clarified that,  since the transactions  under discussion

have their end result into an income and ultimately profit, it cannot be isolated  with  business  profit. He  submitted  further  that,  since  the service was rendered in South Africa and the service providers did not have permanent  establishments in Tanzania, the imposition of withholding  tax  violated  the  provisions  of Article  7  of the  DTA  and Article  138(1) of the Constitution of the United  Republic of Tanzania, 1977.

On  the  third  ground,  it  was  his  submission  that,  since  the  tax was wrongly paid, it ought to have been refunded to the appellant. It cannot  be  refunded  to  the  taxpayers  as  claimed  by  the  respondent because the same have no Tax Identification Number certificates  with the respondent which is the criteria for refunding, he argued. Finally, the counsel urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In his response, Mr. Chuwa started by admitting that, indeed the services in controversy were physically performed outside Tanzania. He  further  concurred  with  the  appellant's  submission  that,  under section 69(i) (i) of the Act read together with section 83 (1) (b) thereof, determination  of whether  a  payment  has  its  source  in  Tanzania  for purpose  of withholding  tax  against  a  non-resident  service  provider,

depends on whether the respective service was rendered in Tanzania. It was his submission however that, for the service to be said to have been rendered in Tanzania, it is not necessary that it  must have been physically rendered in Tanzania. It suffices in his view, if the same was delivered or utilized in Tanzania. His submission was not unsubstantiated. It was founded on the authority in Tullow Tanzania BV (supra) which judicially considered the word "rendered" used under the  respective  provision  to  mean  "supplied"  or  "delivered".  In  the respective  decision  which  was  consistently  followed  in Shell  Deep Water Tanzania B V(supra) and Aggreko  International Project Ltd (supra), the counsel submitted, purposive rather than strict rule of construction  was  applied  because  the  provisions  contain anti-  tax avoidance  rule whose  construction,  under  the  modern  approach, requires purposive rule. In the presence of precedents from the highest Court of the  land,  the  counsel  contended,  correctly  in  our view,  this Court is  not justified  to opt for foreign  precedents as  invited  by the counsel for the appellant.

As  regards  the  decision  in Pan  African  Energy  Tanzania Limited (supra), the counsel viewed it to be distinguishable in so far as it was influenced by a foreign authority discussing foreign law which was not at par with our law.

On the second  issue,  the counsel  contended  that,  the Tribunal rightly differentiated  between  the two  clauses.  In  his view,  business profit entails a financial  benefit which is realized when the amount of revenue gained from  business activities exceeds the expenses,  costs and tax needed to sustain the respective business. He submitted  that, since  business transaction was not among the transactions for which exemption was provided under the DTA, by virtue of Article 20 of the same, it was open for tax.

On the third issue, it was his submission that, since the tax was rightly  paid,  the  issue  of refund  does  not arise.  In  the  alternative,  it was  his  submission,  if there  was  any  refund,  the  same  would  have been  paid to the taxpayers and  not the appellant.  In the final  result, the counsel urged the Court to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  his  brief  rejoinder,  Dr.  Mwiburi  reiterated  his  submission  in chief and added, in respect to the third ground that, refund cannot be made against the taxpayers  in  South  Africa  because they are  not in possession of TIN certificate. According to him, the refund, should in

law, be paid to the appellant as the withholding tax agent who in turn will  remit the same to the taxpayers.

Having  heard  the  arguments  for  and  against  the  appeal,  and upon carefully examining the record, we find it appropriate to consider the substance of the appeal. We shall start with the first ground which in our view, pertains to interpretation of the clause "service rendered" used in section 69(i) (i) of the Act as a criteria for determining taxability of  a   non-resident  person  on  the  income  which  has  its source  in  the United  Republic of Tanzania  and the obligation  of a  person  dealing with  mining  business  in Tanzania to,  under section  83(1) of the Act, withhold income tax from the payment of service fee to such person.

From the counsel's concurrent submissions,  it would appear to us  that  this  is  not  the  first  time  this  Court  is  construing  the  clause "service  rendered" in  section  69(i)  (i)  of the  Act to  determine  if the income  has  a  source  in  Tanzania.  In  the  first  time,  such  issue  was considered  in Pan African  Energy Tanzania  Limited (supra). In the said case just like in the instant one, the services for whose fees withholding  taxes  were  deducted,  were  performed  outside Tanzania by  non-resident  persons.  In  the  first  appeal,  the  Board  treated  the

payment to have a source in Tanzania for the reason that, the analysis of samples done in the United Kingdom which constituted the service, could  not  be  disassociated  with  the  drilling  activity  in  Tanzania.  On appeal  to the Tribunal,  the decision  of the  Board  was  reversed.  The Tribunal, having been persuaded by the Indian authority in Ishikawajima  Harima  Heavy  Industries  Limited (supra), took the view that,  in  as  long  as the  work was  done  in  England  and  the consultants  were  the  residents  of  England,  the  appellant  was  not obliged to withhold tax. The respondent further appealed to the Court which upheld the decision of the Tribunal. It opined as follows:-

"Having given our views on what we consider to  be  the  proper  interpretation  of  the  law relevant in our case at hand,  we proceed now to answer the grounds of appeal raised.  The first  ground  related  to  the  construction  of section 83(1) (c) of  the Income Tax Act that it was erroneous construed by the  Tax Appeals Tribunal.  In  our respective  view,  we  do  not think so.  The construction of the section  was tied  to  the  place  where  the  services  of the respondent was rendered. Services were rendered in  the  United Kingdom  by persons

resident in the United Kingdom.  Section 69(i) (i) does not impose a liability on an individual company to withhold tax where service fee is paid in relation to services rendered out of  the United  Republic  regardless  of the  fact  that payment is made by a company registered in and doing business in  Tanzania.  The situation would have been different if the Respondent was government"

Subsequently,  a  similar  issue  arose  in Tullow  Tanzania  BV (supra).  In  this  case,  the  Court  construed  the  phrase "rendered" to mean "delivered" or "supplied" and held that, the test for determining source of income is not the place of performance but of utilization of the service. In its own words, the Court stated as follows:-

"It  is  our  strong view that the word rendered under  section 69(i) (i)  is synonymous  to  words  "supplied" or n delivered" .   In  this regard, a non-resident who provides services to a resident, has delivered/ supplied services to a resident of  the united Republic of Tanzania.  The recipient of  the service is actually the payer for such services, in which case, " source of  payment"  cannot be any other place except where the payer resides.  In other words as the services of which the payments were made were consumed or utilized in the United Republic of Tanzania, for the purpose of earning  income in  the  United Republic of Tanzania,  then  the

payments made for such services had a source in  the  United Republic of Tanzania  "

It  is  worth  of note that, just as  it is  in  the  instant case,  in  the said case, the Court was strongly urged to follow the position in Pan African  Energy  Tanzania  Limited (supra). The  Court  held the respective case  distinguishable  and  therefore inapplicable for the reason that, it was influenced by an Indian authority which considered a statute in India which was worded differently with the statute in our jurisdiction.  In  particular,  the  Court,  having  reproduced  the  relevant Indian statute, observed that:-

"It is dear from the wording of the provisions above that they  are substantially  different  from section 69(i) (i).  While the Indian Act talks the source of income,  on  the other hand section 69(i) (i) talks of  source of  payment The case of Pan  African  Energy  (supra)  is therefore distinguishable as it  relied  on the interpretation of section 9(1) (vii) (c) of the Indian Income Tax Act  to  arrive  at a  finding  that  the  said provision ; as it was,  was in pari materia  with section 69(i) (i) of  the Act".

The above position has been constantly followed as we said,  in Shell Deep  Water Tanzania  BV {supra) and Aggreko  International Project Ltd {supra) relied upon by the counsel for the respondent.

On our part, we fully subscribe to this recent position of law and differ  with  the  previous  position  in Pan African  Energy Tanzania Limited (supra) for  two  main  reasons.  First,  as  correctly  held  in Tullow Tanzania  BV (supra), the  respective  authority,  much  as  it was  based  on  an  Indian  decision  construing  a  statute  which  is  not worded similarly to ours, is distinguishable and thus inapplicable in the instant case. Second and more importantly is the fact that, the position in Tullow  Tanzania  BV (supra) is  the  more  recent  position.  The settled  position  as  it stands today  is such  that,  where there  are two conflicting  decisions  of  the  Court  on  the  similar  matter,  the  Court, unless  otherwise  justified,  is  expected  to  follow  the  more  recent decision. (See for instance, Ardhi University vs. Kiundo Enterprises (T)  Limited, Civil  Appeal  No.  58  of 2018, Geita Gold Mining Ltd vs. Jumanne Mtafuni, Civil Appeal No. 30 of 2019 and Mabula Damalu &amp; another vs. the Republic Criminal  Appeal  No. 160 of 2015, (all are unreported))

In view of the foregoing discussion therefore, we dismiss the first ground of appeal.

We now proceed with the determination of the second ground on the applicability of  Article 7 of the DTA. It was submitted for the appellant that, the provision is applicable since the service in question was  carried  out  in  South  Africa  and  the  service  providers  had  no permanent establishment in Tanzania. It was submitted further that, the  distinction  between  business  profits  and  business  transaction  is irrelevant. For the respondent, it  was argued that, the provision is not applicable as what  is  exempted  from payment  of  taxes  in the respective provision is business profit of an enterprise and not business transaction.  A  similar  issue  was  considered  in Kilombero  Sugar Company  vs. Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  218  of  2019  (unreported)  where this Court made the following observation  to which we fully subscribe:-

"F/owing from the above, as the service fee is an item  which does not feature anywhere in the  Double  Taxation  Agreement â  Article  20 becomes handy.  The costs incurred by Illovo and reimbursed by the  appellant (which  we have  already  found  and  held  to  be  part  of

service fee) will be taxable in  Tanzania as per Article 21  of the Double  Taxation Agreement Put differently,  it is our considered view that, as  per Double Taxation Agreement, service fee by a South African entity for the provision of professional services to a Tanzanian entity, do not form part of business profits as provided under  Article 7  of  the Double Taxation Agreement which is not taxable in Tanzania but fall  under Article  21  of the  Double  Taxation Agreement and thus subject to withholding tax in terms of  section 83(l)(b) of  the TTA, 2004"

Guided  by the  above authority therefore,  it  is our firm  opinion that the Tribunal was right in holding that the exemption under Article 7 of the DTA  was not applicable to the appellant's business transactions.  We thus dismiss the second ground for want of merit.

Since we  have  held  in  relation  to the first and  second  grounds that, the charging of withholding taxes was correct, there is consequently nothing to refund and, therefore, the third ground becomes  redundant  because  there  remains  no  withholding  tax  to refund.

In  the  circumstance  therefore,  the  appeal  is  devoid  of  any substance and it is hereby dismissed with costs.
