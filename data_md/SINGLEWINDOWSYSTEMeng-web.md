## Introduction

The implementation of the EAC Customs Union was envisaged to be progressive and so far a number  of  milestones  have  been  achieved towards attainment of a  fully-fledged Customs Union  including  establishment  of  One  Stop Border Post (OSBP)  and  Single Customs Territory  (SCT).  Simplified/Easy  cross  border trade  is  among  the  key  factors  for  countries trade  competitiveness.  Tanzania  is  viewed  to be  less  competitive  when  compared  to  other countries in the region in terms of cross borders transactions.

Tanzania has decided to improve its competitiveness  in  the  region  by  improving the  trading  environment  through  its  borders. Particularly, focus  is to gradually facilitate trade by simplifying import, export and transit procedures and documentation while ensuring the  safety  and  security  interests  of  involved states,  economies  and  citizens.  This  leaflet intends  to briefly describe  the  concept  of eSWS, benefits  and  requirement  involved  for smooth implementation.

## What is Electronic Single Window System (eSWS)?

Electronic Single Window concept refers to a facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport  to  lodge  standardized  information and  documents  with  a  single  entry  point  to fulfill all import, export, and  transit-related regulatory requirements. Since the information is electronic,  then  individual  data  elements should be submitted only once.

## Rationale  for  Ecletronic  Single  Window System

To reduce logistics cost and fast track clearance process through Modernization and Interconnection with Government  Agencies related to Trade and logistics.

## Benefits

The Single Window concept examines regulatory  controls  through  the  eyes  of  the trader and views all interactions between trade and regulatory agencies without regard for the internal division within the government  (Paperless  One-gate  One  Stop). This  approach  benefits  both  the  government and  traders  as  it  clearly  brings  out  all  the procedural  redundancies,  duplication  in  the filing of information and wastefulness involved in  the  overall  effort  in  fulfilling  cross-border transactions.

## Benefits to the Government

- · Trade facilitation
- · Effective  and  efficient  deployment  of resources
- · Improved trader compliance
- · Enhanced security
- · Increased integrity and transparency
- · Decrease of illegal trade

## Benefits to the Stakeholders

- · Reduction  in  logistics  costs  through reducing delays
- · Shorten clearance and release time
- · Predictable application and explanation of rules
- · Tracking cargo on real time
- · Promoting transparency
- · Effective and efficient deployment of resources

## Implementation strategy of eSWS

Electronic Single Window System (eSWS) is a Paperless and One-Stop / One-Gate Service System. It is a trade and logistiical web based infrastructure that will be implemented throgh TANCIS.
