## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

10t h  &amp; 30t h  May, 2022

## MWANDAMBO. J.A.:

Before  us in this appeal  is a decision of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal) on appeal from the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board  (the Board). The Tribunal  dismissed an  appeal  preferred before  it  by  the  appellant  challenging  the  respondent's  demand  for payment of tax due post an  unsuccessful  challenge of final  assessment of tax by the Tribunal in Tax Appeal No. 32 of 2013.

The brief facts giving rise to this appeal are as follows: In the year 2013, the appellant filed three appeals before the Board challenging the

respondent's final tax assessments for three consecutive years of income involving  an  amount  of TZS  340,795,245.00  as  the total  tax  due.  The Board  consolidated  the  appeals and  determined  as  such  allowing  them on  the  disputed  expenditure  items  that  had  been  disallowed  by  the respondent in the computation of the income chargeable to tax for the relevant  years  of  income.  The  aggrieved  respondent  appealed  to  the Tribunal which allowed the appeal with the exception of a few expenditure items thereby reducing the tax liability to a certain extent.

The  appellant's  attempt  to  challenge  the  Tribunal's  decision  on appeal before the Court hit a snag in Civil Appeal No. 5B of 2015, for the Court  struck  it  out  for  being incompetent  in  a  ruling  delivered  on 22/08/2016. Subsequently, the appellant commenced steps to institute a fresh appeal which entailed going back to the Tribunal with a view to applying for extension of time within which to lodge a notice of intention to appeal as a first step before accessing the Court.

Amidst the  steps  to  institute  a  fresh  appeal,  on  15/02/2017,  the respondent  sent  a  letter  to  the  appellant  demanding  payment  of TZS 226,937,033  ostensibly  the  total  tax  due  following  the  decision  of the Tribunal. The respondent made the demand in view of the fact that the appellant  had  not  yet  reinstituted  her  appeal  after  the  striking  out  of Civil  Appeal  No.  5B  of 2015.  According  to  the  respondent,  since  there

was no any pending appeal to the Court any more, the tax involved was due and  payable to  him.  Notwithstanding  the  appellant's  plea  with  the respondent to halt the tax collection measures based on her explanation in  a   letter dated  24/02/2017 (part of exhibit A-6), the respondent could not  be  moved.  On  11/05/2017,  the  respondent  demanded  immediate payment of the tax due reminding the appellant that in terms of section 24 (3) of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Act,  2000  [  Cap. 408],  henceforth the TRAA,  the  decision  of the Tribunal  crystallised  into  an  enforceable decree  as  if  it  was  a  decree  issued  by  a  court  of  law.  Besides,  the respondent maintained that, in terms of section 24 (4) of the same Act, even  if  there  was  any  appeal,  it  could  not  operate  as  a  bar  to  the execution of the Tribunal's decree.

Believing that the aforesaid demand  constituted an apellable decision,  the  appellant  filed  before  the  Board  Tax  Appeal  No.  67  of 2017.The appellant's  case  before  the  Board  was  that the  respondent's decision demanding payment of the tax due was illegal in the absence of an  application  for  execution  as  required  by  section  24  (3)  of TRAA  as well  as  rule  23  (1)  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Tribunal  Rules,  2001.  Put  it differently,  the  appellant's  contention  was  that the  respondent  had  no automatic  right to  recover the  amount arising  from  the decision  of the Tribunal.

The  respondent's  counsel  had  a  different  view  contending  that regardless  of  the  fact  that  the  amount  demanded  emanated  from  a decree  of the  Tribunal,  the  respondent  was  empowered  to  adopt  any recovery  measure to  collect  the  tax  due  and  so  he  was  not  bound  to apply for execution  before the Tribunal. From  the  contentions  in  that appeal, the Board framed one main issue for its determination, that is to say;  whether  the  respondent's  decision  demanding  payment  from  the appellant without lodging an application for execution was lawful.

Although the respondent's reply to the statement of appeal did not raise any issue touching on the jurisdiction of the  Board, such  an  issue arose as an alternative argument in the respondent's written submissions in  reply.  It was  argued  for the  respondent that the  Board had no jurisdiction to entertain a fresh appeal from the execution of the Tribunal's decree and  if the appellant had  any issue with the execution of decree,  it was  open  to  her to  challenge  it  before the Tribunal  itself rather than the Board in as much as the Board had no power to execute the former's decrees.  Nevertheless, the  Board took the view that it had jurisdiction  to  determine  the  appeal  under the Tax Administration  Act, 2015  (the  TAA)  considering  that  section  7  of  TRAA  vests  in  it  sole jurisdiction  in  all  proceedings  of a  civil  nature  in  disputes  arising  from revenue laws administered by  Tanzania Revenue  Authority (TRA).

Regarding the merit of the appeal, the Board sustained the respondent's argument  that the demand for payment of the tax due dated 11/05/2017  from  the  respondent  was  made  in  the  exercise  of  his statutory  powers  of  administering  the  TAA  the  legality  of  which  was being challenged  by the appellant. It held that it was legally proper for the  respondent to demand payment of the tax due without recourse to the Tribunal by way of an application for execution. The Board relied on the decision of the Tribunal in Tullow Tanzania BV v. Commissioner General,  TRA, Tax  Appeal  No.  2  of  2013  in  which  the  Tribunal  held that  the  need  to  file  an  application  for  execution  arises  only  when  a decree holder seeks the assistance of the court in executing the decree. It thus dismissed the appeal  hence the  unsuccessful  appeal  before the Tribunal. Undaunted,  the  appellant  is  before  the  Court  in  the  instant appeal predicated on two grounds.

Mr. Ayoub  Mtafya, learned  advocate  from Nexlaw  Advocates, appeared  during  the  hearing  of the  appeal  on  25/4/2022  representing the appellant as he did  before the lower tribunals. The respondent had Mr. Juma Kisongo and Consolata Andrew, learned Principal State Attorneys  along  with Ms. Salome  Chambai,  learned  State  Attorney resisting the appeal. Before Mr. Mtafya rose to address the Court on the grounds  of  appeal, Mr. Kisongo raised an issue touching on the

jurisdiction of the Board to entertain the appeal which, according to him, did  not arise from an objection decision  in the light of section  16 (1) of TRAA.  That  aside,  the  Court  too  wanted  to  be  addressed  on  the propriety  of  the  appellant  challenging  the  validity  of  the  demand  for payment  of  the  tax  due  as  she  did  before  the  Board  instead  of  the Tribunal which  made the decree. At the instance of Mr.  Mtafya  praying for an  indulgence to  allow  him  time to  prepare on  the two  issues,  the hearing of the appeal stood adjourned to 10/05/2022.

At the  resumed  hearing,  we  heard  Ms.  Andrew first in  support of both issues before Mr. Kisongo  chipped  in.  The  gravamen  of  the respondent's argument on the first issue  lies in  section  16  (1)  of TRAA which  provides for appeals to the Board from objection decisions of the respondent.  The  learned Principal State  Attorneys  argued  that  the respondent's demand dated 11/05/2017 for payment of the tax due was not an  objection  decision  from  which  an  appeal  could  have  lied  to  the Board. They argued thus that the Board had  no jurisdiction to entertain an  appeal  from  a  non-objection  decision  pursuant to  section  52  of the TAA.  Elaborating,  Mr.  Kisongo argued that had  the appellant wished to object the respondent's demand in exhibit A-l, she should have followed the  legally  prescribed  procedure  and  channels  for  doing  so.  It was  his further argument that in its decision, the Board did  not address itself to

the dictates of section  16  (1)  of TRAA as well  as section  52 and  53  of TAA on  the  appellability  of  non-objection  decisions  determined  by the respondent.  The  Court was  referred  to  three  of  its  decisions  in Pan Africa  Energy Tanzania  Limited v. Commissioner General  (TRA) Civil Appeal No.  12 of 2018 {Pan African Energy I), Pan Africa Energy Tanzania Ltd v. Commissioner General (TRA), Civil Appeal No.  172 of 2020 (Pan African Energy II) and Shana General Stores Limited v.  Commissioner General  (TRA),

- Civil  Appeal  No.  369  of  2020  (all unreported) to reinforce the argument that the Board's jurisdiction under section  7  of  TRAA  is  limited  to  determining  appeals  from  objection decisions  of  the  respondent  which  was  not  the  case  in  the  instant appeal. The learned Principal State Attorneys urged the Court to sustain the issue raised and hold that the Board had  no jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from the respondent's decision to demand payment arising from a decree of the Tribunal as that decision was not appellable to the Board.

Replying, Mr.  Mtafya argued that the appeal before the Board was grounded on section 50 (1) of TAA which permits appeals from decisions of  the  respondent  affecting  the  appellant.  According  to  the  learned advocate, the respondent's demand notice dated 11/05/2017 constituted an  appellable  decision  covered  by  section  50  (1)  of  TAA  since  the

respondent  issued  the  notice  under  the  first  schedule  to  TAA.  The learned  advocate  implored  us to desist from taking the same approach we took in Pan Africa Energy I and Commissioner General TRA v. Barrick  Gold  PLC, Civil  Appeal  No.  1 1   of 2020  (unreported)  on  what constitutes a decision and instead, we should determine the existence of a decision having regard to the functions of the respondent.

Next,  Mr.  Mtafya  argued that section  16  (1) of the TRAA was not meant to disapply section 53 (1) of the TAA which confers jurisdiction on the Board to hear appeals from objection decisions or other decisions or omissions  of  the  respondent  except  those  excluded  by  section  15  of TRAA. He concluded his submissions on this issue by urging the Court to overrule  the  objection  and  proceed  with  the  hearing  of the  appeal  on merit.

In  rejoinder, Mr. Kisongo  contended  that  the  appellant's  letter dated  24/02/2017  was  not an  objection  recognized  by the  law  neither did  it  comply  with  the  conditions  for  lodging  of  objections  with  the Commissioner General, amongst others, a deposit of 1/3 of the disputed tax  pursuant to  section  15  (1)  TRAA.  As  to  whether  it  was  any  other decision envisaged  by section 53 (1) of TAA, the learned  Principal State Attorney drew the  Court's  attention  to Pan Africa Energy I &amp; II on the jurisdiction of  the Board to entertain appeals from objection

decisions  of  the  respondent.  He  also  drew  our  attention  to Shana General Stores Ltd (supra) in which rejection of waiver to deposit 1/3 of the disputed tax as a condition for entertaining an objection to a final assessment was  held  not to  be an  objection  decision  appellable to the Board. He urged the Court to follow suit.

Arising from  the  arguments  by  the  learned  counsel  for  both parties,  it  is  plain  that  the  issue  raised  touches  on  the  validity  of the jurisdiction of the Board to entertain an appeal against the respondent's decision which the learned counsel have locked horns on whether or not it  was  an  appellable  decision.  Mr.  Mtafya  would  have  the  Court  agree with  him that the demand for payment of the tax due was a decision falling  under  section  50(1)  of  TAA  primarily  because  it  affected  the appellant directly.  The  burden  in  Mr.  Mtafya's  argument  lies  in  section 51  (1),  (4)  and  (5)  of TAA prescribing  requirements which  a  tax  payer aggrieved by a tax decision has to take in objecting it to the respondent. The argument by the  respondent's learned  counsel that the appellant's letter dated 24/02/2017 in response to exhibit A-l was not an objection appears to be plausible. We say so because Mr. Mtafya did not succeed in  persuading  us that such a  correspondence  met the preconditions set out  under  section  51(1)  of TAA  neither  was  it  in  the  form  prescribed under the schedule XI of the Tax Administration (General)  Regulations,

2016  force  in  2017  when  the  respondent  made  the  demand.  Indeed, had  there  been  any  objection  through  the  said  letter,  the  respondent could  not  have  admitted  it  without  the  appellant  complying  with  the mandatory requirements under section  51  of TAA. That means that the respondent could  not have made an objection decision capable of being appealed from in terms of section 16(1) of the TRAA.

From the foregoing it is plain that Mr. Mtafya's invitation to adopt an approach wider than what the Court took in Pan African Energy I &amp; II and Shana General Stores Ltd (supra)  in  the  interpretation  of the  respondent's  letter  dated  11/05/2017  and  treat  it  as  falling  under the category of other decisions or omissions of the respondent appellable to  the  Board  sounds  attractive  but,  with  respect  untenable. Contrary  to  the  learned  advocate,  we  do  not  think  he is  correct  in submitting as he did that the Court took a narrow approach in excluding other  decisions  and  omissions  from  the  realm  of  appellable  decisions. We say so mindful of section  53  (1) of TAA relied  upon  by the learned advocate vesting right of appeal to an aggrieved tax payer subjects such right to the provisions of the TRAA. Section  16 (1) of TRAA as amended by section 110 of TAA provides:

"Any person who is aggrieved by an objection decision of the Commissioner

## General made under the  Tax Administration Act may appeal to the Board".

As  we  stated  in R  v .  Mwesige  Geofrey  &amp;  Another, Criminal Appeal No. 355 of 2014 (unreported):

"... when the words of a statute are unambiguous, "judicial inquiry is complete". There is no need for interpolations, lest we stray into  the  exclusive  preserve  of  the  legislature under cloak of overzealous interpretation.  This is because "courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it  says there!"

We have no doubt that the section  is too clear and  unambiguous to  engage  the  Court  into  a  construction  which  Mr.  Mtafya  alluded  to. Mindful of the foregoing, in Pan African Energy I the Court stated:

" From the above provision [referring to section 16(1) of TRAA as  amended  by  section 110  of  TAA], it is significantly discernible  that an  appeal to  the  Board is presently narrowed down to an objection decision of the CG under the  TAA.  It is beyond question  that,  in  the situation at hand,  there is,  so far,  no objection decision of the  CG and to  say the  least,  going  by the  specific language used in section  16 (1),  the purported appeal before the  TRAB which did not result from an objection decision of  the CG was incompetent." [at  page 13]

The Court did alike in other subsequent decisions amongst others, Pan African Energy II and Shana General Stores Ltd (supra).  It is plain  from  the  foregoing  that the  restriction  of appealable  decisions  is not a  result of the Court's narrow approach as urged  by Mr.  Mtafya  but by the law itself. This explains why in Shana General Stores Ltd, for instance, the Court declined to treat the refusal of waiver to deposit 1/3 of the disputed tax as an objection decision amenable to appeal because the language used in section 16(1) of  TRAA  did not permit  an interpretation by  including appeals  from  the  respondent's  decisions beyond his objection decisions.

It  is  thus  no  longer  in  dispute  that  since  the  appellant  did  not appeal against the respondent's objection decision, the purported appeal was incompetent. The net effect is that the  Board  assumed jurisdiction which it did  not have in entertaining the appellant's appeal from a  non­ objection  decision  contrary  to  the  dictates  of  section  16(1)  of  TRAA. Such an  incompetent appeal  had the effect of vitiating the  proceedings before  the  Board,  so  its  decision. Consequently,  the  appeal  to  the Tribunal together with the proceedings and the resultant decision were a nullity  from  which  no  competent  appeal  could  have  been  instituted before this Court.

Accordingly,  we  are  constrained  to  invoke  the  Court's  revisional jurisdiction  under  section  4  (2)  of the  Appellate  Jurisdiction  [Cap.  141 R.E 2019] and nullify the proceedings before the Board and the Tribunal for being a  nullity and quash their respective decisions as we hereby do rendering the appeal incompetent. Having so held, we cannot determine the other issues in the appeal from an incompetent appeal.

In fine, the incompetent appeal is hereby struck out with costs.
