## 1.0 Introduction

Diaspora,  from  the  historical  background  of  it,  has been used to refer to the group of Jews who dispersed beyond the frontiers of, and who earned their living outside  Israel.    In  the  case  of  Tanzanian  diaspora, these  are  citizens  or  non  citizens  who  have  their origin in Tanzania but currently living and working or doing business in foreign countries.

These individuals have shown interest in supporting their  relatives  or  group  of  Tanzanians  back  home in investing in the national economy.  It is therefore important that the Tanzanian diaspora should know their  tax  rights  and  obligations  before  they  send goods or donations to Tanzania.

## 2.0 Donation to Charitable Organizations and NGOs

Tanzanian diaspora can donate goods to charitable /religious  organizations  or  NGOs  that  are  working in  support  or  provision  of  social  services.    Such donations will be exempted from import duty, excise duty and VAT on importation provided that the goods are for sole use of the intended group (beneficiary) and  that  they  should  never  be    diverted  from  the intended use.

Technically, the recipients are exempted from paying tax  but  it  is  the  government  which  pays  that  tax on  behalf  of  the  charitable  organization  through  a Treasury Voucher and Cheque (TVC) system.

## 3.0 Processing of  Tax Exemption

Recipients of donations from the diaspora are required  to  follow  the  normal  customs  procedure of  clearing  goods  through  a  registered  Customs Clearing  and  Forwarding  Agent.    The  agent  will apply for the tax exemption to the Commissioner for Customs  &amp;  Excise  if  exemption  for  such  goods  is provided for in the tax laws.  The Commissioner will issue an assessment of the taxes and duties involved and submit it to the Treasury which will in turn issue a cheque for the exempted taxes.  As soon as the

Commissioner receives the cheque for the exempted tax / duty from the Treasury, he will release the goods to the owner.

This  clearance  process  is  fast  under  the  Custom's automated system of ASYCUDA++/ASYSCAN where data related to import transactions are electronically keyed in and submitted to the system for processing. Under this automated system, import documents can be lodged even ten days before the arrival of goods and this speeds up the process of documentation and finally examination of goods as soon as they land.

## 4.0 Do all goods qualify for tax exemption?

Not all donations in terms of goods sent by Tanzanian diaspora to recipients in Tanzania are exempted from tax.    Unless  the  goods  are  specifically  exempted  under the East African Community Customs Management Act 2004, through the Government Notice (GN) Nos. 197 and 200 of 2001 and through item 10 of the 3rd schedule to the VAT Act; all other imported goods are taxed at the standard VAT of 18% or at the normal Customs  Duty  rates  currently  in  force.      However capital  goods  such  as  plant  and  machinery  to  any person  and  charitable  organizations  are  relieved from VAT.

All final consumable goods are charged 25% import duty while semi finished goods are levied 10% import duty.  Raw materials, capital goods and agricultural/ irrigation  equipment  are  charged  0%  import  duty. Goods will be exempted from duty if they are to be used solely by a religious organization for:-

- · Advancement of religion; and in case of NGOs goods will be exempted from duty if they are to be  used for the:-
- · Execution  of  the  organization's  functions  and for  relieving  persons from the effects of natural calamities, hazard or disaster.
