## Income Tax Digital content - expanded definition

The Act has expanded the definition of 'digital content' which was provided in the Bill to include examples of electronic content qualifying as digital content. 'Digital content' is now defined as (we have highlighted the additions as compared to definition in the Bill) 'any electronic content that may be downloaded, streamed or accessed in any other manner, including e-books, magazines, news, journals, periodical, database, music, movie, software, mobile phone applications, images, text, sound effects, website, webinar, webcast, which is not simultaneously broadcasted over any conventional radio or television network in the United Republic'. these digital contents will be subject

Therefore, payments to creators of to 5% withholding tax.

## Digital asset - withholding obligation on resident and nonresident withholder

The Budget Speech announced the introduction of a 3% withholding tax obligation on digital asset platform owners in relation to payments to resident persons in respect of transfer of digital assets. Whilst the Budget Speech had stated that this withholding tax obligation would apply to both resident and nonresident digital platforms owners, the Bill limited this obligation to non-residents only. The Act has extended the obligation to residents and therefore the provision applies to both residents and non-residents as proposed in the Budget Speech.

## Agricultural produce -

withholding obligation reversal Although the Bill had proposed a 2% final withholding tax on payments for purchase of agricultural, livestock, forestry or fishery products on supplies made by a resident intermediary person, this is not reflected in the Act and so no withholding tax will be applicable on such payments.

This development mirrors past history. A similar change introduced in the Finance Act 2021 was subsequently repealed in October 2021 through the Written Laws Miscellaneous Amendments (No.6) of 2021.

## Tour guiding services - reversal of proposed final withholding payment treatment

The Bill had proposed to include tour guiding service and related services like porterage, chef services, or luggage carrying services under final withholding payments (subject to 5% resident withholding tax on professional services). The Act does not include this amendment.

## Reduced resident royalty withholding tax rate (5%) on payment to resident sport entity or Tanzania Football Federation (TFF)

'Royalty' (as defined) broadly refers to payments related to intangible rights (for example, linked to intellectual property). Generally, a withholding tax of 15% applies on royalty payments (whether paid to residents or non-residents), but with a lower rate of 10% (since July 2022) on the use of a cinematography film, videotape, sound recording or any other medium. A further lower rate of 5% is introduced for any royalty payment to a resident sports entity or the TFF.

Contributions to the Consolidated Fund by public institutions - reversal of proposed deduction

The Bill had proposed to treat as deductible expenditure the contributions made by executive agencies, public authority or public institutions to the Consolidated Fund. The Act does not include this amendment.

'Digital content' is now defined as any electronic content that may be downloaded, streamed or accessed in any other manner... which is not simultaneously broadcasted over any conventional radio or television network in the United Republic'.

The due date to file excise duty returns is changed to the 25th day of the month following the month to which the return relates (from the last working day of the following month).

Excise duty on raw materials - offset extended to wine manufacturers

The Bill proposed a change to enable licensed manufacturers to offset excise duty paid on imported or locally manufactured undenatured ethyl alcohol2 against excise duty payable on the finished alcoholic products like spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages under heading 22083. The Act extends this credit arrangement to manufacturers of finished wine of fresh grapes4. Reversal of proposed excise duty on betting, gaming, and national lottery stake

## Value Added Tax Exemption - blended or fermented tea

## VAT refund - reversal of proposed 30 day payment deadline

The requirement under the existing law is that the TRA (i) decide on a VAT refund application within 90 days of receiving an application, and (ii) state the period (month) in which the refund will be paid. The Bill had proposed a VAT refund payment deadline of 30 days from the date of submission of the refund application. However, this is not reflected in the Act.

Tax Administration Act 'Cargo consolidator' compliance requirement and penalty for failure to comply

The Act introduces a definition of

'cargo consolidator' as a ' person licensed by a competent authority to operate cargo consolidation and deconsolidation operations '. In addition, the Act outlines the obligations of cargo consolidators to comply with customs regulations and other laws governing the deconsolidation of cargo to its owners upon the importation of goods into the country.

Where a person contravenes these requirements, they commit an offence and are liable to a fine equal to 30% of the customs value of imported cargo.

The due date to file excise duty returns is changed to the 25th day of the month following the month to which the return relates (from the last working day of the following month). The Act introduces a new VAT exemption on blended or fermented tea from locally grown tea leaves.

## maximum fine

The Act limits the maximum fine for the failure to issue a fiscal receipt to 200 currency points (TZS 4,000,000) as opposed to 1,000 currency points (TZS 20,000,000) stated in the Budget Speech and the Bill. Tax Ombudsman Although the Budget Speech had proposed to insert a provision to empower the Tax Ombudsman to hear and address complaints emanating from tax decision, procedural, service and administrative matters, this is not reflected in the Act.

## Tax Revenue Appeals Act Out of Court Settlement - 60 day timeline (plus possible 10 day extension)

The Act has reduced the timeline for an out-of-court settlement to 60 days (from the 90 days proposed in the Bill), but it is still possible to extend this period by up to 10 days upon approval by Tax Revenue Appeals Board (TRAB) or Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (TRAT).

## Bank of Tanzania Act

Transacting in currencies other than the Tanzania Shilling

The Budget speech included a directive to all stakeholders to 'ensure that prices are quoted and paid in Tanzanian shillings'. the Tanzanian shilling is the only legal

This was followed by a Bank of Tanzania public notice of 20 June 20238) which concluded with the following statement: 'The Bank of Tanzania also wishes to remind the public that Section 26 of the Bank of Tanzania Act 2006 stipulates that tender in the country. Therefore, any act of refusing payment in Tanzanian shilling amounts to violation of the Bank of Tanzania Act 2006.'

The Act has now amended the Bank of Tanzania Act by adding a new subsection (2) of Section 26 which reads as follows: ' Save as otherwise prescribed by the Minister in the regulations, a person who transacts using any other currencies other than the legal tender issued by the Bank, commits an offence '. We await the issuance of regulations to provide further guidance on this amendment, as its interpretation is not entirely clear.

Mining Act Requirement to set aside minerals for processing, smelting, refining and trading locally - limited to gold

Whilst the Bill had proposed this requirement to apply on (all) minerals, the Act clarifies this requirement is limited to gold only.

Royalty payment on gold or gemstone - one third by way of deposit of refined gold or gemstone

The Bill proposed for one-third of the royalty amount payable to be settled through deposit of refined minerals into the National Gold and Gemstone Reserve. The Act clarifies this requirement is limited to royalty payment with respect to gold or gemstone by depositing refined gold or gemstone respectively.
