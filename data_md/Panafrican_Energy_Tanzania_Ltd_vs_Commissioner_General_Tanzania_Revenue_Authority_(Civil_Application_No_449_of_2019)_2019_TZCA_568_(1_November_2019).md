## LEVIRA. J.A.:

This  is  an ex-parte  application  for  stay  of  execution pending hearing  inter  parties  before  the  Court. The  Notice  of Motion  is  made under Rule 4(2), 11(4), (4A), (5), (7) and 48(1) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal  Rules,  2009  as  amended,  (the  Rules). It  is  supported  by  the affidavit affirmed  by Mwinshehe Said Kibao, the Finance Director of the applicant.

This  being  an ex-parte application, only  Mr.  Gaudiosus Ishengoma, learned counsel for the applicant appeared on the date fixed for hearing.

In his brief submission in support of the application, Mr. Ishengoma stated that the application  is for ex-parte stay of execution order of the Decree of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal of 2/5/2017 in Income Tax Appeal  No.  19 of 2015.  According  to  him,  the  reasons for ex-parte order are stated under paragraph 19 of  the supporting affidavit. For ease of reference the said paragraph reads:

"I state that despite being fully aware o f the existence o f the Applicant's pending Application for Review, the Respondent,  on 7 October 2019\ issued a Demand Notice against the Applicant with reference Number TRA/L  TD/101  -181  -316/MDM/l  76 (served upon the Applicant  on  9  October  2019)  claiming, among  others, payment of TZS 645,612,560.60 on or before 14 October 2019.  Attached and marked as Annexure FB3 is  a copy of  the above mentioned  Demand  Notice from the Respondent to form part o f  this affidavit."

Mr. Ishengoma submitted further that, the applicant has complied  with  all  the  requirements  under  Rule  11  of  the  Rules.  She undertook to furnish security in case the application for review does not succeed.  Thus,  the  learned  counsel  prayed  for  ex-parte  order  without

fl h f l impnnfr**  m*  *   m y On» wrtor*  tm *#** {tanffttjrv FtJJ) w**h ha» been taoutf to the appear*

On my  part,  tevtng gone through the  nc«ce mc«on, the supporting affidavit,  a M   the  annexed  documents,  and  after  hearing  the ·ubmisrton by the &lt;pp6anTs counsel, I  am of the considered *ew th* the  appNcaoon  is  worthy  of  consideration  try  the  Fi*  Cout  than  the Single JufOoe of the Court I w* explain.

The applicant is seeking for an order for stay of execution penefcng hearing and determination of an application for review (Gvtl Application No. 339/20 of 2019) pending before this Court The sakJ application was flied as the applicant was aggrieved by the decision of the Court  (Juma, a .#   Mwarfja,  JA.,  and  Mziray, JA.) in CMI Appeal No.  192  of 2018 of 4 July,  2018.  The  question  that  follows  Is,  whether  an  order  for  stay  of execution can be made  pending  an  application for review as the provision of Rule  1 1   (3) and  (7)  of the Rules presupposes that an order for Stay of execution is intended to be granted pending appeal.

Having  considered  all the  drcumstances  of  this  application, 1 refrain from making an ex-parte order for stay of execution.  In terms of

Rule  60(1)  of the  Rules I  hereby adjourn  hearing  of the application  for determination by the Court on a date to be fixed by the Registrar.

Order accordingly.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 31s t  day of October, 2019.
