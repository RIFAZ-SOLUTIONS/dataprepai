## A.Shangwa,J.

On the  19th   December  2003, the  applicant TOICO LTD  filed  an  application  for  leave  to  apply  for  the prerogative orders of Certiorari, Mandamus and Prohibition  against the  respondent's decision  to seize his  motor  vehicles  namely  a  tanker  with  Registration No.  TZF  9351  and  a  trailer  with  Registration  No.  TZF 7776  together  with  fuel  for  having been  found  in possession  of  uncustomed  fuel  products  contrary  to

the  Petroleum  Marking  Regulations  (GN  45  of  2001) read  together  with  section  146  of  the  East  African Customs  and  Transfer  Tax  Management  Act, 1970 and S.47 of the value Added Tax Act,  1997.

On 12th July, 2004, learned counsel for the respondent  Mr.  Primi  filed  a notice  of  preliminary objection  that the  application  is  bad  in  law  for  being time barred.

On 31st August, 2005, I ordered that the respondent's  preliminary  objection  to  the  application should be  argued by  way  of  written submissions. Both parties did file their written submissions in accordance with this Court's order.

In  his  written  submissions,  learned  counsel  for the respondent Mr.Primi stated that in terms of section 18(2) and (3) of the Law Reform (Fatal Accidents  and Miscellaneous Provisions)  Ordinance Cap 360, an application for leave to apply for prerogative orders of Certiorari, Mandamus  and Prohibition has to be made from the date the decision  or  act  complained  of  was  made  and  served upon the applicant.

He submitted that the decisions of the commissioner for customs and Excise which the applicant wants  to  challenge were made  on 27th January, 2003 and 28th January, 2003 and duly served on the applicant's Advocate  on 30th April, 2003.  He  said  that  this  application  for  leave  to  apply for  prerogative  orders  was  filed  by  the  applicant  in this  Court  on  19th   December,2003,  about  seven  and half  months  from  the  date  when  the  applicant  was served with the decisions complained of. He contended  that  this  application is statutorily  time barred and  prayed for its dismissal  with costs.

In  reply,  the  applicant  whose  principal  officer  is known as Wilson K. Chacha contended that the respondent's  submission  that  his  application  is  time barred  has  no  foundation  because  earlier  before,  he had  lodged  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the commissioner  for  customs  and Excise to the Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board  which  dismissed  his  appeal on  15th   September,  2003  and  advised  him  to  come  to the  High  Court and apply for prerogative orders.

He  said  that  following  the  said  Board's  decision and  advise,  he  filed  this  application  for  prerogative orders on  19th  December, 2003  which  was well  within the time limit stipulated  by law.

In  rejoinder,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent Mr. Primi  submitted  that  as  the  applicant  wrongly filed  the  appeal  in  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board, he  should  bear  the  risks  of  having  wasted  time  in doing  so,  and  that  therefore,  the  time  within  which he  should  have  filed  his  application  should not  be counted  to  run  from  15th   September,  2003  when  the Board  made  its  decision  and  advised  him  to  lodge this application.

In my  opinion  the  applicant's  application  is  in actual fact time barred as submitted by learned

counsel  for  the  respondent.  Time  within  which to lodge  this  application  cannot  be  counted  to  run  from 15th   September, 2003  when  the Tax  Revenue Appeals Board's  Chairman  dismissed  his  appeal.  According  to section  18(2)  of the  Law  Reform  (Fatal Accidents and Miscellaneous  Provisions)  Ordinance  Cap.  360,  such time  starts  to  run  after  the  decision  to  be  challenged is  made.

In  this  case  time  starts  to  run  from  the  dates when the commissioner for Customs and Excise made his  decisions  which  the  applicant  seeks  to  challenge, that  is on 27/1/2003  and  28/1/2003  respectively when the said commissioner served  a  demand  notice on  the  applicant  for  payment  of  shs  6,500,000/=  as fine for being found  in  possession  of uncustomed fuel products  and  shs  6,426,324/= as  tax assessed  in respect of the uncustomed fuel; and  when  he ordered that the applicant's fuel amounting to 22,000  litres of diesel  and  his  motor vehicles  with  Reg.Nos TZE  9351 and  TZF  7776  be  forfeited  to  the  Government  of  the United  Republic.

In  the  light  of  section  18(2)  of  the  Law  Reform (Fatal Accidents and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance  Cap.360,  time  within  which  the  applicant had  to  file  his  application  cannot  start  to  run  from 15/9/2003  when  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals  Board made  its  decision.  This  is  because  the  decision  which the  applicant  wants  to  challenge  by  applying  for  the prerogative orders of Certiorari, Mandamus and Prohibition is not  the  decision  of  the  said Board's Chairman  but  the  decisions  of  the  commissioner  for

customs  and  Excise  which  were  made  on  27/1/2003 and 28/1/2003 respectively.

For these  reasons,  I  agree  with  Mr.  Primi  for  the respondent that this application is time barred. Therefore, I uphold his preliminary  objection and dismiss this application  with costs.
