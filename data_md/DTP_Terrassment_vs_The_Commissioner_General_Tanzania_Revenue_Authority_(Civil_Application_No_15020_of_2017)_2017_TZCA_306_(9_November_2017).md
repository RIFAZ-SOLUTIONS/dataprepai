## MUGASHA, 3.A.:

The applicant, dtp terrassm ent has brought this application seeking extension of time to file documents omitted from  record of appeal. The application  is  by way of notice of motion  brought under  Rules  10  and 96(6) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009 (the Rules).  The main ground  upon  which  the  application  is  sought  is  that:  the  applicant  was belatedly supplied with a valid decree and the exhibits produced before the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board). As a result, the applicant delayed to  include  them  in  the  record  of  appeal  within \A days  after  filing  the appeal.

The application  is supported  by the affidavit of wilson  kamugisha mukebezi an  advocate  with  Ako  Law,  a  Firm  duly  instructed  to  represent: the  applicant.  In  his  affidavit,  he  has  deposed  that,  the  applicant's  initial appeal was struck out because it was not accompanied by the valid decree and  the exhibits.  He  averred  that,  the applicant  filed  the  notice  of appeal on  16/3/2016  after obtaining  extension  of time and  also  wrote  a  letter  to the  Board  seeking  to  be  supplied  with  the  said  documents.  The  applicant obtained  a  certificate  of  delay  excluding  the  period  from  11/3/2016  to 23/12/2016. Being apprehensive of the expiry of the timelines within which to file an appeal, the applicant lodged the appeal on 20/2/2017 without the documents in  question  which  were supplied on  20/3/2016. This was after expiry of 14 days within which those documents could  have been included in the record of appeal without obtaining leave of the Court. This made the applicant  to  bring  the  present  motion  on  20/3/2017  within  a  week  after being supplied with the requisite documents.

The  motion  is  unopposed  since  the  respondent  did not  file  any affidavit in reply. To  buttress  the motion, the  applicant  filed written submissions in terms of Rule 106 (1) of the Rules.

At the hearing of the application,  Dr. Ong'hwamuhana Kibuta assisted by Advocates Mr. Allan Kileo,  Mr. Wilson Mukebezi and Mr. Nobert Mwaifani represented  the applicant.  The  respondent  had  the services of Mr.  Marcel Busegano learned counsel.

Dr. Kibuta adopted  the  notice  of  motion, the  affidavit and the applicant's written submissions to constitute integral  part of his submission at the  hearing  of the  application.  In  the  written  submissions,  basically  the applicant  amplified  what  is  contained  in  the  affidavit  in  support  of  the application.  In  addition,  it  was  submitted  that,  having  realized  about  the missing opinion of the members of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the Tribunal),  the applicant as well,  requested to be supplied with the same by the  Registrar  of  the  Tribunal.  It  was  further  submitted  that,  despite  the applicant's constant follow up at the Board and the Tribunal, the documents  in  question  were  belatedly  supplied  which  made  it  impossible for the applicant to include them  in  the  record of appeal  within  prescribed time. As such, it was  argued that, the applicant has demonstrated

sufficient:  cause  for  the  delay  to  include  the  omitted  documents  in the record  of  appeal  within  prescribed  time.  To  support  this  proposition, the applicant  relied  on  the  case  of yusufu  same  and  another  vs  hadija yusufu, Civil  Appeal  No.  1   of  2002  (unreported).  In  that case,  the  Court observed  that,  sufficient cause should  be widely  interpreted  to encompass all  reasons  and  causes  which  are  beyond  applicant's  power  to  control  or influence resulting delay in taking any steps.

After  a  careful  consideration  of  the  arguments  in  support  of  the application, the issue  for  determination is whether  the  applicant has demonstrated  sufficient for the  delay  warranting  the  Court to  exercise  its judicial discretion under Rule 10 of the Rules which provides:

"The court may,  upon good cause shown, extend time limited by these rules or by any decision of the High Court or tribunal\  for the doing of any act authorized or required by  these  Rules,  whether before  or after expiration o f  that time and whether before or after the doing of the act; and any reference in these Rules to any such  time  shall be  construed as  a  reference  to that time so extended."

The  discretion  of  the  Court  to  extend  time  under  the  cited  Rule  is unfettered,  but in considering an application  under Rule  10,  the Court  may take into consideration,  such  factors including  the  length  of delay  and  the reason for the delay. [(See the case of HENRY muyaga  vs . t t c l Application No. 8 of 2011 (unreported)].

In  considering what amounts to sufficient cause,  factors to  be taken into  account  include:  whether  or  not  the  application  has  been  brought promptly;  the  absence  of  any  valid  explanation  for  delay  and  lack  of diligence  on  the  part  of  the  applicant.  (See  the  case  of tanga  cem en t COMPANY  LIMITED  v  3UMANNE  D.  MASSANGA AND  AMOS A.  MWALWANDA c i v i l  a p p lic a t io n   no.  6 o f  2001 (unreported).

According to rule 96(1) (d),  (h) and  (k) of the  Rules, exhibits which constitute part of the proceedings, a valid decree and opinion of assessors constituting  documents  necessary  for  the  proper  determination  of  the appeal, are amongst vital documents which must be in the record of appeal or else the appeal will be rendered incomplete.

In  the  present application,  the applicant on  21/9/2016  sought to  be supplied with the said documents but was belatedly supplied on  16/3/2017

by the Tribunal's  Registrar.  As  such,  it was  beyond  the applicant's control to  have those documents incorporated  be it at the time of filing  an appeal on  20/2/2017  or thereafter,  before  the expiry  of  1 4  days  after the  appeal was filed. In this regard,  it can safely be vouched that, it was beyond the applicant's capability to invoke Rule 96 (6) of the Rules to include the  said documents  within  the  prescribed H  days  after  the  appeal  was  filed. Besides,  the applicant promptly filed the  present application  in  less than a week  being  after  supplied  with  the  said  documents  by  the  Tribunal's Registrar. This in entirety  exhibits a valid explanation for delay and constitutes sufficient cause according to what we said in the case of tanga CEMENT  COMPANY  LIMITED  v  JUMANNE  D.  MASSANGA  AND  AMOS  A. mwalwanda (supra). [Also,  having  considered  the  sequence of events,  it is  apparent  that  the  delay  was  occasioned  by both  the  Board  and  the Tribunal having belatedly supplied the requisite documents despite applicant's  constant  follow  up.  In  a  nutshell,  what  caused  the  applicant's delay  was  beyond  her  power  and  control  to  take  necessary  steps  as  we said in YUSUFU SAME AND ANOTHER VS HADDA YUSUFU (supra).

In  view  of  the  aforesaid  reasons,  I  am  satisfied  that,  the  applicant has  advanced  reasons  for  the  delay  which  I  consider  as  good  cause  in

terms of rule 10 of the Rules. Thus,  I   hereby grant the application whereby the applicant  should  include  the  said  documents  omitted  in  the  record  of appeal  not  later  than  twenty  one  (21)  days  from  the  date  of this  Ruling. Costs be in the event.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 7lh  day of November, 2017.
