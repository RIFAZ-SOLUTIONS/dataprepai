## RULING OF  THE COURT

25th June, &amp;  3rd JulYr  2018

## lUMA, C.l.:

The appellant TANELEC LIMITED  (the taxpayer) is a limited liability company in  the business of manufacturing and distribution  of electrical transformers and switchgears. Its head quarters is in the city of Arusha. THE COMMISSIONER  GENERAL (Tanzania  Revenue Authority)  (the respondent) is,  on the other  hand, a  body corporate established under section  4  of  the  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority Act  (Cap  399)  for purposes  of assessment  and  collection  of  taxes  and  other revenues.

On 31 st December  2014  the respondent,  acting under  section  28 of  the Value  Added  Tax  Act, 1997,  issued  and  served  the appellant with a notice of Value  Added  Tax Certificate/Interest No. 429663074  for the years  2009 to 2012. In  its essence, the notice required the appellant to pay Value Added  Tax amounting to Tshs.l,  039,065,475/= on imported services  the appellant  had  enjoyed  during  that period  of  tax  assessment.

The Appellant was aggrieved with that assessment.  By a  letter dated 9 th January,  2015,  the  appellant  communicated  its  objection  to  the respondent, on two grounds. Firstly by insisting that the respondent had erred to demand the value added tax on imported services which the appellant had  already been properly accounted for,  and also declared through the appellant's VAT returns. Secondly,  that the respondent had erred by charging interest under section 28 of the Value  Added Tax Act, Cap.  148 R.E. 2006 (the VAT  Act) on value  added  tax which the appellant had accounted  for in its returns to the respondent. Despite  the objection, the respondent stuck to its position by insisting that according to section 16 (1) (b) of the VAT  Act  the appellant  should  first have  paid the input tax, which the appellant had  not. Finally, on  18  March2015 the  respondent invoked section 13  (5)  of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap.  408 to

formally inform the appellant that the assessment  of Tshs.1, 039,065,475/= was  not only  correctly  assessed  by  the respondent,  but  was also  due  from the appellant.

The appellant lodged its appeal to the Tax Revenue  Appeals Board (the Board)  against the respondent's  assessment.  At the Board  where the appellant filed its Statement of Appeal the main issue  was whether; the appellant should have paid input tax on imported services  before claiming the same  in its  Value  Added  Tax  returns.

The Board dismissed the appellant's appeal after  finding  that  the respondent  had  correctly assessed  the tax, which is due  and payable.  The Board relied on additional documents it asked the parties to supply and found that the appellant failed to prove that the Trans Century Investing Africa  of Nairobi  Kenya supplied  management  services  to the appellant.

Aggrieved by the  decision of the  Board, the  appellant  lodged an appeal,  Tax Appeal No. 30 of 2016, to the Tax Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal (The  Tribunal).

On 04/12/2017, the Tribunal dismissed  the appellant's  first appeal,  by upholding the Board in its conclusion  the appellant should have  first paid

the input tax on imported  services first before the appellant  could claim the same in VAT returns.

The appellant  is dissatisfied  with  the decision of the Tribunal  and has lodged the present appeal before us, raising the following  eight grounds of appeal:

- 1. -That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in holding that input tax on  imported services  has to be paid first before claiming the same in the  VAT returns.
- 2. That  the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal overstepped its authority by adopting a construction of the  Value Added  Tax Act  Cap. 148 which results in absurdity and renders the law ineffective and impracticable.
- 3. -That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in holding that the Tax Revenue  Appeals Board has been given wide  powers and is not bound by rules of evidence/ thereby condoning breach of the rules of natural  justice by the Tax  Revenue  ppeals  Board  in VAT A Appeal  No. 15 of  2015.
- 4. That  the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred  in  holding  that  the  Appellant  ought  to  have

produced documents notwithstanding  that  one of the issues  which  were  framed  concerned  a  paint of  law.

- 5.  That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal contradicted  itself  and erred in law in  that,  while it insisted  on  the  duty  of  the  Appellant  to  produce documents  to  the  Board,  it,  through  its  ruling  in Application No. 25 of 2017, denied the Appellant the opportunity  to prove that the documents were actually presented to the  Board,  but the  Board  made  a determination without hearing  the  Appel/ant.
- 6.  That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that the Board was correct in making  a  determination  on  accounting  for VAT  on imported services  which  was  not  an  issue  before  it.
- 7.  That the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal contradicted itself and erred in law in holding that the Board  had  to  satisfy  itself  that  the  appellant  had accounted  for VAT  before  he  claimed  for input tax,  but it failed to appreciate that the Board made the determination  on accounting for  VAT from documents presented  to it by the Appellant after  closure of the proceedings/ but such determination was  made without giving the Appel/ant opportunity to explain and make a submission  on  the  documents  as  presented

8.  That both  the Honourable Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  and the Board  trampled  on the fundamental principle  of  ustice that they  are  the  parties'  judge and j not their oracle  by embarking  on issues  not brought before  them  for  determination.

At the hearing of the appeal, Mr.  Elvaison Maro and Mr.  Nicholaus Duhia, learned advocates who  appeared for  the  appellant,  made oral submissions  and relied  on written submissions  they had filed in earlier on. Likewise,  Mr. Primi  Telesphory Manyanga,  learned  advocate  who appeared for the Respondent made oral submissions and placed reliance on the written submissions  he had  filed in earlier  on.

On the third  and eighth grounds of appeal which Mr.  Maro argued together, he complained that the Board  and the Tribunal had condemned the appellant  without according  the appellant hearing  thereby violating the rules  of natural  justice. He referred us to pages  21 and  22  of the record  of appeal  where parties  were before  the Board,  had agreed  on  only  one  main issue  for  Board's determination,  i.e., whether the Appellant should have paid input tax on imported services  before claiming the same in  its VAT returns.  But,  after hearing  the  parties  on  17/11/2016  and  setting 21/11/2016  as  the  date  to  deliver  its  judgment, the  Board  while

deliberating alone in the absence  of the parties, inexplicably ordered the parties  to furnish  extra  documents.

The Board asked Appellant's VAT returns for the years 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.  The Board also wanted the Appellant's  invoices  relating to the  imported  management  services for  the  same  period.  Mr. Maro expressed  his deep alarm over the way, after receiving the documents it had  requested to  assist in  its deliberations, the  Board used  the  same documents  to make  conclusions  which were adverse  and damaging  to the appellant's appeal without  according the appellant the right to be  heard over  those  extra  documents.

The learned advocate referred us to pages  69, 70, 71 and 72 of the Judgment which show how the Board used the added documents tomake statements and conclusions which fundamentally turned the outcome of the appeal against the Appellant, all  without  hearing the appellant. Mr. Maro submitted that ideally, after the Board  had called for the additional documents  while composing  its  Judgment,  the Board should  have  accorded the Appellant an  opportunity  to be  heard before making comments and conclusions  adverse to the appellant. In cementing his stand against the decision of  the  Board using extra  documents and  raising new issues

without hearing  the parties, Mr.  Maro, cited to us several  decisions  where this Court  has taken a firm stand  to reiterate the mandatory  duty of courts to observe  the rules  of natural  justice.

Mr.  Maro  cited to us, the case of EX-B.8356 S/SGT SYLVESTER  S. NYANDA  VS  THE  INSPECTOR  GENERAL  OF  POLICE  &amp;  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, CIVIL APPEAL  NO.  64 OF  2014 (unreported) where at the commencement of the trial, three issues  were framed in respect of which the  parties gave evidence to support their  respective positions  in that case. It later  transpired  that the trial Judge  did not  decide the outcome of the case on the issues which were framed and submitted on by the parties, but on an issue which the trial Judge had framed suo motu. The Court made the following observations which are pertinent to the instant  appeal  before  us:

"  ..  we wish  to say  that it is an elementary nd . a fundamental  principle of  determination  of  disputes between  the parties that courts  of law must limit themselves  o the  issues  aised y the  parties  in the t r b pleadings  as to act otherwise  might well result in denying ny  of  the  arties  he  right  to  fair  hearing. ee a p t -s among  others/  the case  of Mire Arran Ismail  &amp;

## Another  V.  Sofia Njatt Civil  Appeal No. 75 of 2008 (unreported).

However, as  correctly  submitted by  both  parties, we are  aware that the trial court had  power to amend,  add, or to strike out issues under Order XIV Rule 5 of the CPC  ....

It  is  important to  note  nevertheless,  that  this provision has  qualified that the  amendment or  additional issues  should  be  done  as  may  be  necessary  for determining  the  matters  in  controversy between  the parties, in our vie~  meaning  limitation according to the issues raised by the pleadings.  We  desire to add, as correctly submitted by the appel/ant that where this is done, prudence requires that the parties are afforded opportunity  to  address the  court  on  the  issues so amended or added, in tandem with the audi alteram partem principle of  natural  justice as  has  been  insisted in a range of cases  including those relied upon by the appel/ant  as  pointed out  at  the  beginning.  In the  case of MBEYA-RUKWA  AUTOPARTS AND  TRANSPORT LTD  VS JESTINA  GEORGE MWAKYOMA [2003J T.L.R. 251 in which  the  English  case of  Ridge V.  Baldwin [1964J AC 40 was considered, the Court emphasized that:

''In  this  country,  natural justice  is not  merely a principle of  common law; it has  become  a fundamental constitutional right. Article 13(6) (a)  includes  he  right  to t be  heard  among  attributes  of  equality efore  the  law.  .. " b

Mr.  Maro blamed the Tribunal for failing to rectify the fundamental error  of  denying  the  appellant  its  right  to  be  heard  by the  Tribunal condon   ng the  decision  of  the Boa  rd  . i

Mr. Maro  also took particular exception  to the Tribunal's holding that the  Board has  wide  powers, including not being bound by a  rules of evidence applicable to ordinary courts. This holding of the Tribunal, the learned  advocate  submitted, resulted in the breach  of the rules  of natural justice which occasioned  injustice to the appellant leading  to the dismissal of his appeal. Powers  of the Board  are neither absolute nor arbitrary, but must be exercised  judicially, Mr. Maro  submitted. In so far as the learned advocate is concerned, the powers of the Board and the Tribunal when receiving evidence, is  not as wide as suggested by the Tribunal in  this appeal. He submitted that section 17(2) of the Tax Revenue  Appeals  Act, Cap 408  directs  the Board  and  the  Tribunal, when receiving  evidence,  they are  to act  as if  they are  ordinary  courts  exercising  jurisdiction in a civil  case

in  accordance  with the provisions of the Civil  Procedure  Code.  Mr.  Maro urged  us to find that the Board is not  vested  with such a wide power  as to violate  the principles  of natural  justice.

For the respondent, Mr.  Manyanga, urged the Court to dismiss the appeal  maintaining  that it is devoid  of merit.

With regard to the right to be heard, the learned advocate  submitted that the main issue  which the parties proposed  for determination, that is, when input tax was  supposed  to be paid,  expected  the appellant  to tender evidence like VAT returns  and invoices, which the  appellant failed to present at the Board during the hearing. He  submitted further that the Board  was in  fact  lending  assistance to  the  appellant  by  calling for documents  to assist  the Board in its  deliberations  and  final  decision.

With respect: to the complaint over the appellant's right to be heard, Mr.  Manyanga  submitted that the Tribunal had  properly interpreted the wide powers  of the Board  to call for additional evidence because  Rule  17 (1) of  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board Rules 2001allows  the calling  for any document which may assist the Board  in  its deliberations. He submitted that the appellant has no  cause  to complain because  the documents  were

supplied long before deliberations were made, and parties were called before  the Board off the record  for clarification  purposes.

In  his  rejoinder,  Mr.  Maro stoutly disputed Mr.  Manyanga's line of submission that  after  the  Board  had  received the documents from the appellant, deliberations were made  and parties were called, albeit off the record,  for clarification purposes.  Mr. Maro referred us to pages  39 and  40 of the record of appeal which shows  that on 17/11/2016, after the Board had  completed the  hearing of the  parties,  it  scheduled to  deliver its judgment  on 21/11/2016.  But the following  day on  18/11/2016,  while deliberating in the absence  of parties,  the Board invoked Rule 17(1)  of the Tax Revenue  Appeals  Board Rules, 2001 and  ordered  the parties  to submit new documents. Mr. Maro  refuted the claim  that the appellant was  invited to deliberate  on  the documents.

From submissions  of  the two learned  counsel  we  feel  obligated, before considering the  opposing submissions on other  grounds of  appeal, to address ourselves first to the complaint over the denial of fundamental right  of  the  appellant  to be heard  by  the Board.

From  our perusal  of the record,we think Mr. Maro  is right to express his deep  concern  over the way  the Board,  and later the Tribunal, relied  on documents  the Board  had received  and acted on, while in the boardroom composing its judgment.  Excerpts from the Judgment of the  Board on pages  69 to 72 of the record of appeal, illustrate how the Board  analysed the appellant's  tax returns and invoices,  casting  doubt on such  matters as the  identity  of  the  suppliers of  management fees, nature of  imported services  which the appellant would probably have clarified had  he been summoned  for hearing. So adverse  to the appellant  was  the analysis  of  the Board,  that the Board  made  such  conclusions  as:

..  ,  the Board  is  of  the  findings  that  by  making incorrigible allocations in the VA  T  returns the Appellant wrongly accounted for input tax  in his tax returns which gave  him undue  advantage  of  paying to  the Respondent less  value  added  tax,  hence  the  Respondent  was  right to invoke  the provisions  of section 43 of the  VAT Act;. 1997 [page 72]

Our perusal  of pages  286 and 287 of the record of appeal bears  out Mr. Maro's  exasperation  on how  the  Tribunal  which  had  a chance  to rectify, failed  to step  in.  While  on  one  hand  the  Tribunal  accepted  the fact  that the

right to be heard is an  integral part of ordinary courts, but on the next breath the Tribunal denied the appellant that same right to be heard on explanation that: "  ... the Board has been  given wide  powers and it should be  noted  that the  Board  is  not  bound  by  rules  of  evidence."

It  seems  clear  from decisions  of  this Court  that the right to be heard  is not exclusively  meant for ordinary courts. Even the Tax Revenue  Appeals Boards and the Tax Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal shave the duty to accord parties their right to be heard. This position of the law came out in the decision of the Court which Mr.  Maro cited to us,  in MBEYA-RUKWA AUTOPARTS AND TRANSPORT LTD VS JESTINA GEORGE MWAKYOMA (supra)  to  the  effect  that  natural  justice is now  a fundamental constitutional right in Tanzania.

The case  of SAMSON  NG'WALIDA  VS THE  COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF TANZANIA  REVENUE AUTHORITY, CIVIL APPEAL  NO. 86 OF  2008 (unreported)  is  perhaps, a  reminder  to  the  Boards and Tribunals, that they too are bound by the constitutional principle of the right to be heard. One  of the grounds  of appeal  to the Court of Appeal  in SAMSON  NG'WALIDA (supra)  was  that  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal had dismissed  the appellant's  appeal  on  a ground  that was  neither

raised by the parties, nor were the parties called to address the Tribunal on that ground which the Tribunal  had raised suo  motu. On appeal,  this Court stated:

"The last ground of appeal is that the Tribunal in arriving at  its decision  that it  had  no  jurisdiction  to hear the appeal did not give the  parties an opportunity to be heard on the matter.  This issue was  raised by the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal suo motu and a  decision made  without hearing the  parties. The case  of Highlands Estate Ltd  v.  Kampuni ya  Uchukuzi Dodoma Ltd &amp; Another, Civil  Application No. 183 of 2004 (unreported) was  cited to  support the complainant by the appel/ant that the Tribunal  erred in this respect On this  ground of  appeal  there  is  no  need  to waste  time. In the case of Highlands supra, the Court cited the case of VIP Engineering and Marketing Limited and Others Vs  City Bank Tanzania  Limited, CA  T Consolidated Civil References  No 6,  7, and 8 of 2006 (unreported)  to emphasize the importance of giving a party  the right  of hearing before making an adverse decision  against that party. In the case  of VIP (supra) the Court in arriving at its decision had quoted from another case  and  said:-

'The  right of  a  party to  be  heard  before adverse  action or  decision  is  taken  against  such  a  party has  been  stated and emphasized by the courts on numerous decisions. The right is  so  basic  that  a decision  which  is  arrived  at  in violation  of  it  would  be  nullified.  . ' .

The  Tribunal  was required  to  hear  the  parties before  it  made  its  decision on  the  question  of its jurisdiction  on the matter. It went against the rules of natural justice  to raise the issue suo motu and then gave a decision on it without first giving the parties an opportunity to address  the Tribunal  on the matter.  This ground has  merit and  it  is  allowed"

In  view  of  the  clear  stand  which  this  Court  took  in  cases  of NG'WALIDA and VIP (supra), to the effect that the right of a party  to be heard  before  an adverse  action or decision  is taken against  such  a party is a  basic  constitutional duty, and that any violation of which nullifies the entire proceedings; we shall not in the instant appeal before us, consider other grounds  of  appeal.

In the instant appeal, the third ground of appeal contending that the appellant was denied its right to be heard is sufficient to dispose  of the appeal.

We shall allow  this  appeal  and order  that  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Board at Arusha  shall hear afresh the APPEAL  NO.  15  OF 2015 between TANELEC LIMITED and the COMMISSIONER GENERAL  OF THE TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY. Each party shall bear its own costs
