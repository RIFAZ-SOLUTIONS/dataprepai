(An appeal from the Judgment and Decree of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal at Dar es Salaam)

dated the 19th  November,  2017 in Tax Appeal No. 9 of 2016

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

24th   February &amp; 6t h   March, 2020

## MUGASHA, J.A.:

The  appellant, pan  african  energy  Tanzania  ltd is a company registered  in Tanzania dealing  in  natural gas production and  supply of gas for  power generation  at  Ubungo  Power  Plant in  Dar-es-salaam,  it supplies natural  gas to  both  industrial  and  commercial  customers  in  Dar-es-salaam city. Also, it supplies compressed natural gas for use in motor vehicles.

Before April 2013, the respondent Tanzania  Revenue Authority (TRA) conducted an audit on the appellant's tax affairs including Pay As You Earn commonly  known  as  PAYE  and  gathered  that  the  appellant  used  the grossing  up  method  in  PAYE  and  remitted  to  the  respondent  without withholding  the same  from  the  employees'  taxable  income  from  the employment  earnings.  On  this  account,  the  respondent  issued  to  the appellant  a  notice  to  demand  PAYE  accruing  from  the  salary  and  other benefits  paid  to  employees.  This  prompted  the  appellant  to  lodge  an objection which was dismissed by the respondent. As such, on  19/12/2013 the  respondent  issued  to  the  appellant  certificates  indicating  a  liability  in respect of PAYE at a tune of TZS.  1,166,197,808/= comprising the principal sum of TZS. 677,194,295 and interest thereon TZS. 489,003,513/=.

Aggrieved, the appellant appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the TRAB), where the crucial  issue for determination was the propriety or otherwise of the respondent's decision to disallow the grossing  up method on the PAYE and imposition of interest on the assessed tax. Guided by the provisions of sections 81  (1) and  (2),  7 (2) (a) to (g),  100 (1),  103 (1), of the  Income Tax  Act,  2004  the TRAB  partly  disallowed  the  appeal  having concluded  at  page  287  to  288  that,  the  appellant  had  applied  gross  up 2

method  to  pay  PAYE  which  is  not  recognized  under  the  Tax  laws  of Tanzania.  As for the  interest,  the TRAB found  no justification  to  have the appellant penalized because she had not willfully neglected or attempted to evade  tax.  As  such,  the  interest  of TZS.  489,003,513/  =   was  waived  in favour of the appellant.

Discontented,  the  appellant  appealed  to  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal  (the  TRAT)  faulting  the  TRAB  for  holding  that  the  grossing  up method  on  PAYE  is  tantamount to  giving  taxable  benefits  to  employees. Having considered the provisions of sections 7 (1),  (3) (a) to (i) and 81(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act, the TRAT dismissed the appeal concluding at page 629 to 130 as follows:

"An  individual's  income  from  employment  is  the total  gain or  profit of  that individual. In the present case the grossing up method of  PA  YE  applied  by the appellant provided tax benefits  to  the  employees who would have collected a lesser take home pay, except for the employer's sympathy by footing the tax bill.  Hence the relief  granted by the employer to the employee was a gain to the employee,  and as such gain it was a benefit which attracted tax, as it is not exempted within the meaning of  section 7 (3)

(a) to (i) of  the Income Tax Act  The employer was duty bound to  withhold it  within  the  meaning  of section 81(1) and (2) of  the Income Tax  Act...  "

Still  undaunted,  the appellant  has appealed to the  Court raising two (2) grounds of complaint namely:

- 1. That the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  grossly erred  in  law  by holding  that the grossing  up  method  used  by the  appellant for the  purposes  of computation  of  PAYE  for  its  employees  is  not justifiable in law.
- 2. That the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  grossly erred  in  law  by holding  that  the  grossing  up  method  of  PAYE  applied  by  the appellant  provided  tax  benefits to  its  employees which  are  not exempted  under section 7 (3) (a) to (i) of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

Parties filed written submissions containing arguments  for and against the appeal  which  were adopted  at the  hearing  of the appeal.  The appellant had the services of Messrs. John Kamugisha, Abel Mwiburi, FAyaz Bhojan  and  William Mang'ena, learned counsel. The  respondent  was represented  by  Ms.  Alice  Mtulo,  Mr.  Daniel  Nyakiha,  (both  learned  State Attorneys) and Mr.  Harold Mugami, legal counsel of the respondent.

In  arguing the two grounds of appeal together,  it was submitted for the  appellant  that,  it  was  a  misconception  on  the  part  of  the  TRAT  to conclude  that,  the  method  of  grossing  up  invoked  by  the  appellant  in computing  PAYE for its employees,  eventually provided taxable benefits to those employees. Besides, since the appellant had entered into employment contracts with  its employees on  net salary  basis the grossing up  method  on  PAYE  was  justified  because  the  practice  is  internationally accepted and it is not prohibited by the law as it does not adversely impact on  the  employees'  liability  to PAYE  regardless  of  the  modality  of  the withholding  which  was  not  appreciated  by  the  TRAT.  To  back  up  this argument the appellant's counsel  referred  us to the case of hartland vs DIGGINS HL (926) AC 286.

It was further contended that, the approach adopted by the appellant is  supported  by the  practice  in  other Commonwealth jurisdictions  namely: Kenya,  South  Africa,  Ireland  and  United  Kingdom  whereby  apart  from nonexistence  of  specific  legislative  provisions  regulating  gross  up,  the

principle is applicable.  In this regard,  it was argued that, since in Tanzania grossing  up  is  not  prohibited,  the  law  does  not  in  any  way  place  the respondent  at  a disadvantage  in collecting the expected PAYE  from employment earnings.

Apart from faulting the criteria  used  by the TRAT to  be absurd  as  it increases a  marginal  income  rate of 35.7  %  as opposed  to the  maximum rate  in Tanzania  which  is  30  %,  it was  submitted  that the  PAYE  made  by the appellant  did not result to additional benefit  to the employees. However,  it was contended that,  though  having  entered  into a  net of tax arrangement with  its  employees  the  appellant  had  obligation  to  withhold and  remit  net  taxes,  duties  levy  and  other  imposition  on  behalf  of  the employees, the appellant still paid PAYE to honour its duty as a withholding agent in terms of the provisions of section 81 of the Income Tax Act.

It  was the  appellant's view that,  with  the  grossing  up  method,  the total  amount  paid  and  withholding  portion  deducted  was  a  genuine  and legitimate expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income.  The  appellant's  counsel  urged  us  to  take  inspiration  in  another TRAT's  decision  in commissioner  general tra   vs kilom bero  sugar

lim ited Tax  Appeal  No  32  of 2013  whereby  the  method  of grossing  up was applied on the expenditure of management fees.

When  probed  by  the  Court  on  the  legal  basis  of  the  grossing  up method  Dr.  Mwiburi  submitted  that, though  it is  not prohibited,  the  mode of collection and remission of PAYE is similar to that of withholding tax.

On the other hand, in opposition of the appeal it was submitted that, whereas  the  chargeable  income  tax  from  the  employment  earnings  is  a creature  of  provisions  of  sections  6  (1)  and  7  (1)  of  the  Income  Tax, section 81  (1) of the Act,  makes the employer an agent of the respondent and is duty bound to withhold tax from the employee's earnings and  remit the  same  to  the respondent.  Thus,  though it was  improper  for  the appellant  not  to  withhold  on  what  accrued  as  benefits  to  employees  as required  under  section  7  (1)  and  (3)  of the  Income Tax Act,  the  method shifted  the employee's obligation to  pay tax from  chargeable  income from the employment earnings which is as well, against the law.

It was also argued that, the net of tax contracts of employment was contrary to the  Income Tax Act and the  net of tax  amount on the salary and  the  appellant's  obligation  to  deduct and  withhold  tax  and  remit  it to the respondent was not waived by grossing up method which is prohibited under the provisions of section 81 (2) of the Income Tax Act.

On the case  law and  Employers' tax guides of other Commonwealth jurisdictions,  Ms.  Mtulo  distinguished  the  case  of hartland vs  diggins (supra) arguing the same to be applicable in  England which allows net tax arrangement as opposed to Tanzania whereby the law does not allow such arrangements. On the Employers' Tax Guides, she contended the same not to be  in favour  of  the  appellant's  case and instead it cements  the respondent's position. Finally, it was the respondent's conclusion that, since the grossing  up  method on  PAYE does  not feature in the Income Tax Act, the  appellant  contravened  the  provisions  of the  law  regulating  PAYE  and the appeal is not merited and it deserves to be dismissed with costs.

In  rejoinder the appellant's counsel  reiterated  the earlier submission adding  that,  the  instruments  on  tax  guide  from  Kenya  and  South  Africa supports  the  appellant's  case.  It  was  thus  reiterated  that  the  appeal  be allowed.

We have carefully considered the submissions by the learned counsel and  the  entire  record  before  us  and  the  issue  for  determination  is  the

propriety or otherwise of the grossing up method  invoked by the appellant in the computation of PAYE which the appellant had paid to the respondent. Prior  to  that, it is  crucial  to  scrutinize  in relation  to  the employment,  the  law regulating the income  tax base; taxing of  the chargeable  income,  modality  of  collection  and  remission  to  the  Tanzania Revenue Authority in relation to the employment earnings.

In  terms  of section  5  of the  Income Tax Act,  the total  income  of a person  is  the  sum  of  the  person's  chargeable  income  for  the  year  of income from each employment. According to the provisions of section 6 (1) (b) of the Income Tax Act, the chargeable income of a person for a year on income  from  any  employment shall  be,  in  case  of a  resident  person,  the income from employment and for a non-resident, the person's income from employment  to  the  extent  that  the  income  has  a  source  in  the  United Republic  of  Tanzania. What  constitutes  the  chargeable  income  of  an employee  is  stipulated  under  section  7  (1)  of the  Income  Tax  Act  which provides:

"An individual's income from an employment for a year  of income  shall be  the  individual's gains  or

## profits  from  the  employment of the individual for

## the year of  income"

According  to the  provisions of section  7  (2)  of the  Income Tax Act, subject to exceptions prescribed under subsections (3), (4) and (5), what is to  be  included  in  the  calculation  of  individual's  gains  or  profits  from  the employment  comprises:  payment  of  wages;  salary;  payment  in  lieu  of leave,  fees,  commissions,  bonuses,  gratuity  or  any  subsistence  travelling entertainment  or  other  allowances  received  in  respect  of employment  or service  rendered. The employer's obligation to deduct,  withhold  and  remit the tax  in  question  to  the  Tax  Authority  is  regulated  by the  provisions  of section 81 (1) and (2) which stipulates as follows:

"81 (1) -A resident  employer  who  makes  a payment that is  to  be  included in  calculating  the chargeable income of an employee from employment  shall  withhold  income  tax  from  the payment at the rate provided for in paragraph 4 (a) of  the First  Schedule.

(2) The  obligation  of  an  employer  to withhold income  tax  under  subsection  (1) shall  not  be reduced or extinguished because the employer has a right or is under obligation to deduct and withhold any other amount from the payment or because of  any other law that provides  that  an  employee's  income  from employment shall not be reduced or subject to attachment."

Black's Law Dictionary Eighth Edition, Bryan A. Garner,  Editor in Chief defines the word extinguish as follows:

- " 1. To  bring  to an  end;  to put to an  end;  2.  to

terminate or cancel; 3. to put out or stifle"

Having  withheld  the  PAYE,  then,  in  terms  of  section  84  (1)  of  the Income  Tax  Act,  the  employer  as  agent  of  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority must  remit  the  withheld  sum  within  seven  days  after  the  end  of  each calendar  month  and  file  with  the  Commissioner  within  30  days  after  the

end  of six  months  a  statement  specifying  among  other things,  the  name and address  of  the withholdee  and income  tax  withheld from each payment.  According  to  subsection  (4),  a  withholding  agent  who  fails  to withhold income tax, must nevertheless pay the tax that should  have been withheld in the same manner and at the same time as that tax is withheld.

It is not  in dispute  that,  the  appellant  invoked  the  grossing up method  and  paid  PAYE  to  the  respondent  on  behalf  of  its  employees. However, parties locked horns on the legality of computation of the taxable income of the employees by grossing up method and the appellant's option to  pay  PAYE to the  respondent without deducting  and  withholding  it from the employee's earnings. This in our considered view,  constitutes a crucial point of law on which the appeal  lies in terms of section 25 (2) of the Tax Revenue Appeal Act [cap 408 re.  2004] which  is the domain  of the Court in  respect of Tax Appeals.

It was the  appellant's contention  that,  the grossing  up of PAYE and paying it to the respondent  was  for  the purposes  of  honouring its obligation  under  the  law.  We  found  this  argument  wanting  because  in terms of section  81  of the Income Tax Act, the appellant was  mandatorily

obliged  to  withhold  PAYE  from  the  employees'  salary  and  other  benefits and  remit the  same  to the  respondent.  Therefore,  apart from  not  having honoured his statutory obligations the appellant was not justified to invoke the grossing up method on PAYE on the basis of the employment contracts which cannot in any way supersede the law regulating chargeable tax from the  individual's  gains  and  profit from  the  employment.  We  are fortified  in that account on the basis of what we said in in the case of mbeya cement COMPANY  LIMITED  VS  COMMISSIONER  GENERAL, Civil  Appeal  No  160  of 2017  (unreported). In that  case, the  appellant, instead of  deducting withholding  tax  amounting  to  2%  franchise  fee  due  to  Lafarge  South Africa, the appellant paid from other sources of its income. The Court held:

"The  law  on  how  withholding  tax  should  be  paid  is  dear.  It  is provided under section 83 (1) (b) of  the Act It  reads:

"83 (1) Subject to subsection (2), a resident  person who-

- (a) N/A
- (b) Pays a service fee or an insurance premium with a source in United Republic to a non-resident person

shall withhold income tax from the payment at the rate provided for in  paragraph  4  (c)  of the  First Schedule."

If  payment was not  paid in accordance with the foregoing provision,  the course of  action, certainly offended the law and amounted to grossing up."

The  stated  principle  which  frowns  on  the  grossing  up  method  is applicable  in  the  present  matter  and  the  appellant  ought to  withhold  the PAYE from the employee earnings and remit it to the respondent instead of paying from own appellant's pocket or other sources of income which was irregular. Therefore,  appellant's  reliance  on  the  case  of hartland  vs diggins (supra)  apart  from,  with  respect,  being  cited  out  of context,  in that  case one, there  was  no  written  letter  on  the  employment  contract from  which  to  discern  the  actual  employment  earnings  of the  employee. This  is  not the  case  in  the  instant case whereby the employees' letters of engagement  mention  the  salary  whereas  the  living  allowances,  House benefit,  School  fees  and  car  benefit were specifically stated  in  the extract of the appellant's  payroll which constitute  Exhibit Rl. Two, the  Employers

Tax  Guides in the United Kingdom presuppose  existence  of  a prior understanding  between  the  Revenue  Authority  and  the  Employer  and  as such,  it  does  not  automatically  give  a  lee  way to the  employer to  invoke grossing up method  as  suggested  by  the  appellant. Three, the law applicable  in  Tanzania  is the  Income Tax Act which  defines and  regulates the chargeable tax and the manner of withholding and  remitting the same to  the  Tax  Authority.  This  is  further  clarified  in  the  TRA  Employer's  Tax Guide which provides the modality of calculating amounts to be included in calculating employment income of monthly pay.

The  existence  of  the  said  domestic  legal  instruments  in  Tanzania regulating  the taxable  income  rules out the applicability of the  Employer's Tax Guide in respect of United Kingdom, Kenya and South Africa.  However, they  cement  the  respondent's  case  as  correctly  argued by  Ms. Mtulo because they avail  to  the  employers the  following  guidance  in  respect of withholding  tax and  the consequences of the  Employer paying  PAYE from own sources as hereunder reflected.

The South  African  Revenue Service  Guide  on Taxation  of foreigners working in South African 2010/11 in para 9.7 is on the employees' tax paid on behalf of an employee is to the effect that:

"Certain employers contractually agree to settle an employee's tax liability  whilst that employee is on secondment in a foreign country.  The objective is to ensure  that  the  seconded  employee  remains  tax neutral and  is in no worse  position than if secondment had not been accepted.  This practice encourages employees to accept secondment assignments  in  foreign  countries  known  as  tax equalization.

A  taxable benefit arises if an employer pays part or full of the foreign  employee's South African tax  liability. Should  the  employer choose  to  settle the  normal  tax  on this benefit.  A  further taxable  benefit  will arise. This will continue on a recurring basis until a final  a normal tax liability is determined."

The bolded expression is similar to what obtains in Tanzania on what amount to tax benefit under the item which falls under paragraph 3.5.2 of

the Tanzania  Revenue Authority,  Employer's Guide on  Pay As You  Earn as follows:

"Tax benefit occurs when the employer pays tax on behalf  of  the employee. In this case, the amount of tax paid is treated as benefit in kind in hands of  the employee that is tax on tax."

In relation our neighbour Kenya its Revenue Authority Employer's Tax Guide on Pay As You Earn in paragraph 5.4 improvises as follows:

"5.4 An  employer should always  deduct  tax from pay unless  they are otherwise advised by Revenue. If  an employee makes payment on a "free  tax basis" the pay for PA  YE purposes is the amount  which,  after deduction  of the  correct tax and PRSI,  would give the amount actually paid to the employee,  i.e. the amount actually paid to the employee should be regressed to arrive at the figure of  pay to be taken into account for PA YE  purposes."

The essence of guide is to the effect that, an employer should always deduct  tax  PAYE  is  similar  to  section  81  (1)  and  (2)  of  the  Income  Tax

which mandatorily requires the employer  to withhold tax from the employment earnings of the employee.

In  the  circumstances,  in  the  present case,  the  appellant's  obligation to withhold the tax in question  remained  intact and  it was not at any time extinguished in terms of section 81  (2) of the Income Tax Act.  In addition, the appellant's obligation remained intact by virtue of section 84 (3) (4) (5) of  the  Income  Tax  Act  regardless  of the  appellant's  default  to  withhold income tax in accordance with the law.

We  now  have  to  resolve  the  appellant's  concern  to  the  effect  that grossing  up  is  not  expressly  prohibited  under  the  Income  Tax  Act.  This really  taxed  our  minds.  We  asked  ourselves  if the  legislative  intent  is  in favour  of  the  appellant  who  instead  of  withholding  the  PAYE  from  the salaries and benefits paid to the employees, unilaterally applied the grossing  up  method  to calculate the  PAYE and  proceeded  to  pay  it to the respondent from own sources.  Our answer is in the negative and we shall give  our  reasons.  We  have  deemed  it crucial  to  borrow a  leaf on  what  is reflected from  page 26 to 27 of that book on "Law and Practice of Income Tax" by Kanga,  Palkhivala and Vyas Volume  1   ninth  Edition which contains

a  collection  of principles on tax cases based on Indian Tax  Law discussing rules of construction of taxing statutes.  From page 26 to 27 of the book the author states as follows:

"While construing a provision that creates a right ; the court must always lean in favour of a construction that saves the right rather  than  one  which  defeats  the  right.. .However, the interpretation should lead only to the logical end; it cannot go to the extent of reading something that is not stated in  the provision.  Full effect should be given to the language used in the provision and a rigid or restricted interpretation must  be avoided.

[Emphasis supplied]

Similarly, in the case  of cape brandy  syndicate  vs  inland REVENUE COMMISSIONERS [1921]  1   KB 64 it was held:

".... In taxing dear words are necessary in order to tax the subject.  Too wide and fanciful construction is often given to that maxim,  which  does  not mean  that  words  are  to  be unduly restricted against the Crown , or that there is to be any  discrimination  against  the  Crown  in  those  Acts. It simply means that in taxing one has to look merely at what is clearly said.  There is no room for intendment. There is no equity about tax.  There is no presumption

## as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied....."

[Emphasis supplied]

The said  position  was emphasized  in the case of Charles Herbert WITHERS BROTHERS- PAYNE VS THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, Civil Appeal  No.  55  of  1968  EACA  (unreported)  where  the  Court  categorically said:

"The statutes enacted for imposition and collection of  income tax must  be strictly construed . "

We fully  subscribe  to  the  aforesaid  position  because  in  the  familiar canon  of  statutory  construction  of  plain  language,  when  the  words  of  a statute are  unambiguous, judicial  inquiry is complete because courts  must presume that a  legislature says in a statute what it means and  means in a statute what it says there.  As such, there is no need for interpolations, lest we  stray  into  the  exclusive  preserve  of  the  legislature  under  cloak  of overzealous  interpretation.  See  republic  vs.  mwesige  geofrey  and another, Criminal  Appeal  No.  355  of  2014  and resolute  Tanzania LIMITED vs COMMISSIONER general, TRA Civil  Appeal  No.  125  of 2017 (both unreported).

Thus, we are of settled mind that, in view of the clear language used in  the  provisions  of  sections  7,  81  and  84  of  the  Income  Tax  Act,  the employer  is  mandatorily  required  to  withhold  the  employees'  chargeable tax from the employment earnings and  remit the same to the TRA. Thus, the appellant's suggestion on non-prohibition of the grossing up is interpolations  of  what  is  not  stated  in  the  law.  Besides,  the  appellant's argument on there  being  no  harm  on the appellant  using  own  sources to pay the  PAYE  on  behalf of the  employee  in  effect  is  reading  what  is  not stated  in  the  law  and  it  negates  the  principle  of  giving  full  effect  to  the language used in the law.

Given the circumstances, as earlier pointed out, we are satisfied that the  appellant contravened  the  provisions of sections  7  (1)  (2)  and  81  (1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act under which she was obliged to deduct and withhold  PAYE and  remit the same to the respondent.  As such, we do not find  sound  reasons  to  vary  the  decision  of  the  TRAT  because  it  was justified  to treat tax  paid  by the  employer on  behalf of the employees as benefit in kind in the hands of the employee and it was subject to tax.

In  view  of  what  we  have  stated  herein  above,  the  appeal  is  not merited.  We  uphold  the  decision  of the TRAT  and  order  the  appellant to pay the demanded tax and accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs.
