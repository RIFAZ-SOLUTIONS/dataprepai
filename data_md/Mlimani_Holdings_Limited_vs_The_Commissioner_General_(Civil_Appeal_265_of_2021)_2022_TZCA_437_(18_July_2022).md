## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

5th   &amp;  18th  July,  2022

## MWANDAMBO. J.A.:

The  issue  for our determination  in  this  appeal  is  narrow  but with significant importance. It involves a challenge on the interpretation of an agreement between two contracting states viz. the Governments of the Republic  of  South  Africa  and  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania.  The dispute  is  centered  on  Article  7  of  the  Agreement  for  Avoidance  of Double  Taxation  and  the  Prevention  of  Fiscal  Evasion  with  respect  to Taxes  on  Income,  henceforth  the  DTA,  yet  again  before  the  Court for

determination  on  its  interpretation.  The tale  behind  the  dispute  is  easy enough to comprehend.

Between the year 2013 and 2016, the appellant made payments to a South African entity, to wit,  MDS Architecture,  henceforth, the foreign consultant  in  the  sum  equivalent  to  TZS  1,500,549,808.00  as  service fees  for  architectural  services  to  its  project  in  Tanzania.  In  terms  of section 83(1) (b) of the Income Tax Act, (the Act), the appellant had an obligation to deduct  15% from the amount paid as withholding tax and remit it to the respondent. As the appellant did not make the deduction, it  did  not  account  for  the  said  amount  to  the  respondent  by  way  of withholding tax returns for the relevant period.

Sometimes in  2017,  the  respondent conducted  a  tax audit on  the appellant's  affairs  which  revealed  that  the  appellant  had  paid the foreign  consultant  an  un-accounted  sum  of TZS.  1,500,549,808.00  as fees for the services rendered without deducting  15% from that amount and  remitting  it to the  respondent on account of withholding tax. Whilst admitting  that  ordinarily,  such  amount  was  liable  to  15%  withholding tax,  the  appellant  contended  that  it  was  exempt  from  deduction  by reason of Article 7 of the DTA. The respondent  contended that notwithstanding the DTA, such payment was liable to deduction because it  did  not  constitute  part  of  the  business  profits  of  the  foreign  payee

service provider  falling within the  scope  of  Article 7 of  the DTA. Eventually,  the respondent  issued  three  withholding  tax  certificates demanding a  total  sum  of TZS.  346,492,916.00  for the  period  2013  to 2016.

Following an unsuccessful objection against  the demand,  the appellant appealed to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board). The appellant's case before the Board was that,  it was not obliged to deduct the  invoiced  amount  on  the  strength  of  Article  7  of  the  DTA  which exempted the foreign consultant payee from withholding tax in Tanzania in  which  it  had  no  permanent establishment and  thus taxable  in  South Africa  in  which  it was  resident. The  respondent's  stance  was that the DTA had no avail to the appellant in so far as the service fees paid to a foreign consultant was outside the scope of Article 7 of the DTA because it did  not form  part of its business  profits and thus liable to withholding tax in Tanzania.

In  its  decision,  the  Board  sustained  the  respondent's  position.  It held  that  the  service  fees  were not  embraced  in  the  definition  of business profits of the payee in the carrying of its business neither did it fall  under any of the categories of the specific articles  in  the  DTA.  The Board  reasoned  that  the  service  fees  fell  under  Article  20  of the  DTA which subjected such payment  to  withholding tax and, since the

appellant defaulted  in  accounting  for it,  the  respondent was entitled  to demand it as he did. On appeal, the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) concurred with the  Board sustaining  its decision  resulting  into dismissing the appeal.

Aggrieved,  the  appellant  is  now  before  the  Court  in  this  appeal predicated on one ground of appeal. She is faulting the Tribunal for the alleged  erroneous  interpretation  of  the  DTA  and  holding  that  service fees  paid  to  MDS  Architecture  were  not  covered  under  section  128  of the Act read together with Article 7 of the DTA.

Mr. Juvenalis Joseph Ngowi, learned advocate from Dentons EALC East African  Law Chambers represented the appellant in this appeal and filed his written submissions  in support  of  the  appeal raising two interrelated  issues.  One,  whether the service fees paid  by the appellant to  MDS Architecture  in the years 2013 to  2016 ordinarily subject to tax under section 83(1) of ITA fell under Article 7 of the DTA.  Two, whether the  withholding  tax  certificates  issued  by  the  respondent  reflecting  a withholding tax liability were justified.

Mr.  Hospis  Maswanyia,  learned  Senior  State  Attorney,  filed  the respondent's written submissions in reply resisting the appeal urging the Court to  dismiss  it.  We  are  indebted  to  both  learned  counsel  for  their industry unveiling valuable material in support  of  their respective

positions  in  their  submissions.  We  shall  be  excused  for  our  inability  to make reference to each of them in the determination of this appeal  not as  a  result of  lack  of courtesy to  them,  but due to the  dictates  of the issue involved in this appeal.

Essentially, the appellant's submission faults the Tribunal's approach in the interpretation of the DTA which is said to be erroneous. The learned advocate impressed  upon the Court that the  DTA traces its origin  to  the  OECD  Model  Tax  Convention  and  UN  Model  Treaties  and thus their  interpretation  of the  relevant  articles  by  the  courts  in  other jurisdictions  has  based  on  the  Model  Convention  and  Commentaries having  a persuasive  guidance  to  the  interpretation of  the relevant articles  in  the  DTA.  The  learned  advocate  contended  that  a  proper interpretation  of the  DTA  should  have  followed  the  approach  taken  in other jurisdictions which have interpreted similar double taxation agreements.

A great deal of the history of the double taxation agreements and development  in  their  interpretation  occupied  a  significant  space  in  the submissions  of the  learned  advocate.  This  was  meant to justify  why  it was wrong for the Tribunal to hold as it did that the term profits did not include service fee of the payee in the carrying out of its business within the  context  of  Article 7  of  the DTA. Reference  was  made  to  the

principles governing  interpretation of tax treaties citing  an  excerpt from the  judgment  of  Lord  Denning  in Bulmer  Limited  v.  S.A  Bollinger [1972]  2 All.  ER  1226  for the  proposition  that such  interpretation  must look at the purpose as opposed to the words used in meticulous detail or be  concerned  about  the  precise  grammatical  sense.  In  addition,  the learned advocate made reference to Article 3(1) of the Vienna Convention  on  the  Law  of Treaties  of  1969  on  the  approach  towards interpretation of international conventions based on good  faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning  used  in their context in the  light of its objects and purpose.

Further reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court of  South  Africa  in Commissioner  for  the  South  Africa  Revenue Service v. Tradehold Ltd 2012, 3 All SA 15 to reinforce the application of the approach to the interpretation of the conventions based on giving effect to their purpose in a  manner which  is in  harmony with the words used. In that  case, the  Supreme  Court  was  interpreting  a  double taxation agreement between the Republic of South Africa and Luxembourg based on OECD  Model  Tax  Convention. The learned advocate  underlined  an  excerpt  in  the judgment  underscoring  that the DTAs use wording of a wide nature aimed at encompassing the  various taxes generally found in the OECD member countries.

From the foregoing line of argument, the learned advocate sought to persuade  the Court  that  the fees the appellant paid to MDS Architecture  were  for  professional  services  or  other  activities  of  an independent  character  to  the  tax  payer  earning  the  income  in  her resident state who has the right to tax such income and  not the state of the  recipient of services  considering  that the  payee  had  no  permanent establishment so as to attract tax in Tanzania.

Mr. Ngowi  could not  mince  words  responding  to  the  Court's question on the correctness of the approach  he was championing in the light of  the decision in Kilombero  Sugar  Company  Limited  v. Commissioner General, Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal No.  218  of  2019  (unreported).  He  was  unrelenting  in  his  oral  address that  the  decision  was  erroneous.  Even  though  he  did  not  give  notice under  rule  106(4)  of  the  Tanzania  Court  of  Appeal  Rules,  2009  (the Rules),  he  invited  the  Court  in  the  course  of  hearing  to  depart  from Kilombero for having taken a narrow approach in interpreting the DTA. Justifying his standpoint, the learned advocate  contended  that  the Court's  attention  was  not  drawn  to  the  OECD  commentaries  on  the relevant Articles from  the  OECD  Model Tax  Convention  from  which  the DTA traces its route as a result of which the Court gave a narrow view in interpreting  the  DTA.  By  reason  of  such  approach,  Mr.  Ngowi  argued,

the Court erroneously concluded that the service fees paid to the foreign consultant fell  under Article  20  of the  DTA subjecting  it to  withholding tax. Mr.  Ngowi  invited  us  to  be  persuaded  by  the  foreign  decisions which,  according  to  him,  have  correctly  interpreted  similar  agreements based on the OECD Tax Convention model to give effect to the DTA.

Resisting the appeal, Mr. Maswanyia stuck to his written submissions in reply in support of the decision of the Tribunal urging the Court  to dismiss  the  appeal. Stripped off  the nitty gritty of  his submissions, the learned Senior State Attorney argued that the Tribunal rightly interpreted the  DTA by  holding  that the service fees  paid to the foreign consultant were not part of the payee's business profits envisaged under  Article 7 of  the DTA  justifying the respondent's demand for the payment of the withholding tax from the appellant as he did. It was his further argument that as the service fees did  not fall  in any of the specific articles, it fell under Article 20. He was emphatic that except for interpretation  of anti-avoidance tax  provisions,  it  is trite  law that  tax statutes must  be  interpreted strictly. We  think  the latter argument is not necessarily correct in the context of the instant appeal considering  that the Tribunal  was  not  interpreting  a  tax  statute  per  se but an international treaty. Otherwise, the learned Senior State Attorney was unmoved by the invitation to rely on foreign decisions in

interpreting the DTA considering that the Court had already pronounced itself on  a  similar issue  in Kilombero followed subsequently in Mantra (Tanzania) Ltd v. Commissioner General TRA, Civil Appeal  No. 430 of 2020 (unreported).

In  his  rejoinder,  Mr.  Ngowi  reiterated  his  submissions  and  added that,  the term  service fees should  be given a wider interpretation to be accommodated  under  the  term  business  profits  within  the  scope  of Article  7  of the  DTA.  He  reiterated  that even  though  the  appellant  had not  properly  moved  the  Court to  depart  from  its  previous  decisions  in Kilombero and Mantra (supra)  it  had  discretion  to  do  so  to  give  a proper interpretation to the DTA, subject of the appeal.

Having examined the written submissions and heard oral arguments  for and against the appeal, the critical issue for our determination  is whether the service fees paid to the foreign consultant constituted  part of the business profits covered  by Article 7 of the  DTA. An affirmative answer to the issue attracts an inevitable holding that the appellant had  no obligation to deduct from the fees  paid to the foreign consultant withholding tax payable  to the respondent, hence, the demands in  the withholding  tax certificates  in  the  amount of TZS.  TZS 346, 462,916.00 were invalid and vice versa.

As alluded to earlier on,  the  interpretation  of the  DTA is  not  new before this  Court. It featured  as one of the  interrelated  issues for the Court's determination  in Kilombero where the appellant challenged the decision of the Tribunal which, like here, made a similar interpretation of the DTA.  That  case  involved  a dispute  over  the liability to remit withholding tax on  service fees  paid to  a  South  African  entity who  had provided management  services  to  her. Like in the instant  appeal, Kilombero was caught up in a demand for withholding tax which it failed to  deduct  from  the  service  fees  it  had paid  to  her  foreign  service provider.  Again, as it is the case in the instant appeal, Kilombero argued that the service fees it paid constituted  part of the business profit of the South African consultant payee which were not liable to withholding tax.

It  is  apparent  from  the  judgment  that,  the  learned  counsel  for Kilombero  had  reinforced  his arguments on the OECD  commentaries as well as a book  titled: International  Tax Policy and Double Taxation  Treaties, 2n d   edition  2014  by  Kevin  Homes  with  a  view  to persuading the Court to hold that the service was covered  under Article 7 of the DTA. The Court took a different view. It endorsed the Tribunal's decision which  had  held that the service fees were outside the scope of Article  7  (1)  rather,  Article  20  of  the  DTA. After  revisiting  the  two articles the Court stated:

"Flowing  from  the  above,  as  service  fee  is  an item  which  does  not  feature  anywhere  in  the Double  Taxation Agreement, Article 20 becomes handy,......it is our considered view that,  as per the Double Taxation Agreement, service fees by a South African entity for provision of professional services  to  a  Tanzanian  entity,  do not  form  part  o f business  profits  provided  for under Article 7 of the Double Taxation Agreement which is not taxable in  Tanzania but fa ll under  Article  21 of  the  Double Taxation Agreement and thus subject to withholding tax in terms o f  section 83 (1) (b) o f  the FT  A, 2004. "[At page 25].

Few months later, a similar issue involving a dispute on the liability to  withholding  tax  by another South African  entity which  had  rendered services  to  a  Tanzanian  entity,  arose  in Mantra  (Tanzania)  Limited (supra). The Court reaffirmed  its position  in Kilombero and dismissed Mantra's argument for being untenable.

We heard Mr. Ngowi arguing with deep conviction that Kilombero was  decided  without  the  benefit  of arguments  based  on  OECD  Model Tax  Convention  Commentaries  hence taking  a  narrow  interpretation  of the DTA. It is against  that  argument  that  the learned advocate championed  for a  departure  from Kilombero. With  unfeigned  respect,

Mr.  Ngowi's argument falls on  the face of the very judgment he wants us  to  depart  from. As  seen  earlier,  the  OECD  Commentary  in  the Materials  on  International  TP  and  EU  Tax  Law  and  International  Tax Policy  and  Double  Tax  Treaties  (supra)  were  placed  by  Kilombero's counsel to persuade the Court accept the argument that the service fee was not liable to withholding tax it was caught up by Article 7 (1) of the DTA.  The  Court  felt  unmoved  to  interpret  the  DTA  in  line  with  the learned counsel for the appellant in that appeal.  Mindful of the doctrine of precedent, the Court rejected the arguments by the learned advocate and sustained the Tribunal's decision.

Quite  unfortunate  to  the  appellant,  the  Court  is  bound  by  its decision  in Kilombero reaffirmed  in Mantra on  similar  factual  setting except  for  the  parties  involved. In  any  case,  despite  Mr. Ngowi's submission  and  invitation  to  depart from  the  position  taken  in  the  two cases,  the  Court  has  not  been  properly  moved  to take that  route  if we were minded to agree with his argument. The learned advocate conceded as much on the  noncompliance with  rule  106  (4)  of the  Rule which states:

"(4)  Where the parties intend to invite the Court to depart from one o f its own decisions,  this shall be clearly  stated  in a separate  paragraph o f the

submissions, to which  special  attention  shall  be drawn; and the intention shall also  be  restated as one o f  the reasons."

That has not been done in the written submissions neither did Mr. Ngowi  intend to do so  before the commencement of the hearing of the appeal.  He did so in answer to the Court's question.  Be that as it may, it is now  settled that  departing from  a previous  decision cannot  be undertaken  by an ordinary court rather,  a  full  bench empaneled  by five justices  which  may  entail  overruling  the  previous  decision  if the  Court sees justification to depart.  See: Freeman Aikaeli  Mbowe v. Alex O. Lema  &amp; Another, Civil  Appeal  No.  84  of 2001  (unreported), Abually Alibhai  Aziz  v.  Bhatia  Brothers  Ltd [2000]  T.L.R.  288, National Microfinance Bank v. Commissioner General, TRA, Civil Appeal No. 168  of  2018 and Ophir  Tanzania  (Block  1)  v. Commissioner General, TRA, Civil Appeal No. 58 of 2020 (both unreported).

It  is  thus  obvious  that  despite  Mr.  Ngowi's  urging,  it  would  not have  been  opportune  for  us  to  accept  his  invitation and  consider departing from Kilombero in the manner he submitted.

The  above  said,  consistent  with  our  decision  in Kilombero, we hold that the service fees the appellant paid to MDS Architecture did not constitute  part  of the  business  profits  of the  payee  and  thus  liable  to

withholding  tax  in  Tanzania.  Consequently,  as  the  appellant  did  not remit the  withholding  tax  in  accordance  with  section  83  (1)  (b)  of the Act, the  respondent was entitled to issue the impugned withholding tax certificates as he did.

In  the  event,  we  find  no  merit  in  this  appeal  and  dismiss  it with costs.
