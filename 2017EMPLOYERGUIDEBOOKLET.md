## PART I

## 1.0 PRELIMINARY INTERPRETATION

## 1.1 PURPOSE OF EMPLOYER'S GUIDE

- 1.1.1    The  purpose  of  this  guide  is  to  assist  employers  in  the  operation of  the  PAYE withholding tax system and deals in detail on matters concerning the system as a whole.
- 1.1.2  The Employer's Guide is a guide only and provides ready assistance on the operation of the system.  However, it in no way substitutes or modifies the Income Tax Act, 2004, Tax Administration Act, 2015 or the Income Tax Regulations. For the authoritative and comprehensive rules you should consult the respective tax laws. The PAYE withholding tax legislation is contained in Subdivision A of Division II of Part VII of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

## 1.2 ASSISTANCE FROM TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY OFFICES

The guide is not exhaustive in every detail. If the guide does not answer some particular issue the employer should contact any Tanzania Revenue Authority Office or Call Centre for advice.

## 1.3 APPLICABILITY OF 'PAY AS YOU EARN'

- 1.3.1  The withholding tax system in respect of income from employment under  the  Income  Tax  Act  is  described  as  Pay  As  You  Earn,  in short PAYE. A resident employer or a non-resident employer with a permanent establishment  in Tanzania,  who  makes  a  payment  that is  included  in  calculating  chargeable  income  of  the  employee  with respect  to  the  employment  is  obliged  to  withhold  income  tax  from the payment at the rate prescribed in the Income Tax Act. For this purpose 'employment' includes any position of an individual entitling the individual periodic remuneration in respect of services provided for  whatever  period  other  than  payments  made  in  respect  of  the individual conducting a business.

- 1.3.2  An employee's year of income is the calendar year; hence the PAYE year runs from 1st   January to 31st   December of each calendar year. Tax on employment income is calculated on payments made by the employer to the employee during the calendar year.
- 1.3.3  For resident employees with one employment the amount of tax to be withheld from employment income is based on the total income from employment for the year. The tax rates for individuals as per Paragraph 1 (1) of the First Schedule to this act are applied to calculate the tax to be paid for the year with respect to the employment (the 'annual tax  liability').  The  annual  income  is  divided  evenly  over  the  twelve months period and the amount (PAYE) that should be withheld from the employee's taxable payments for each month is established. If the  employee's  income  changes  during  the  calendar  year  and  the original  tax  proves  not  to  be  correct  under  the  new  circumstances an adjustment in the revised annual income and tax liability must be made during the year to rectify the position.  If the correct amount is not withheld by the end of the year, a further adjustment is required, which  may  result  into  either  an  extra  payment  of  tax  or  refund  of overpaid tax.
- 1.3.4  For non-resident employees tax is withheld at a flat rate of 15% of the gross income from employment. This is a final withholding and the amount withheld satisfies the employee's income tax liability with respect to employment.
- 1.3.5  The  amount  of  withholding  tax  is  based  on  all  amounts  that  are required to be included in an employee's income from employment and this includes all types of in kind and non-cash payments.  See further Part II, paragraph 3 of this Guide.

## 1.4 OBLIGATION OF THE EMPLOYER TO WITHHOLD TAX

- 1.4.1  Under  the  provisions  of  the  Income  Tax  Act,  2004  every  resident employer (and non-resident employer with a permanent establishment in Tanzania) is obliged to withhold tax upon payment of income from

employment regardless of the number of employees engaged at any time and whether or not the employer has been specifically instructed to do so by the Commissioner .Where a withholding tax agent fails to  withhold  income  tax  from  payment  as  required  by  the  law,  the withholdee shall be jointly and severally be liable  with the withholding tax agent for payment of tax to the Commissioner.

- 1.4.2  The obligation of  an  employer  to  withhold  tax  is  not reduced or  extinguished because the employer has a right or an obligation to  deduct  or  withhold  any  other  amount  from  payment  of  income from  employment  or  because  of  any  other  law  that  provides  that an  employee's  income  from  employment  shall  not  be  reduced  or subjected to an attachment.
- 1.4.3  If an employer fails to comply with the withholding tax provisions of the  Act  and  the  Regulations  the  employer  is,  nevertheless,  liable for payment of the tax to the Commissioner as well as interest and penalties for such failure.

## 1.5   OBLIGATION OF THE EMPLOYER TO WITHHOLD TAX FROM SECONDARY EMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS

- 1.5.1  Where an employee has two or more employments at the same time and more than one employer then one of the employers is required to withhold tax. The employee shall (at the employee's choice) select one of those employments to be the employee's primary employment. The remaining employments shall be secondary employments of the employee. An employee is required, at the time he first takes on a second or further employment, to notify all the employers of his choice that they are the employee's secondary employers.
- 1.5.2  A secondary employer must withhold tax from payments he makes at the highest individual tax rate stipulated in the Act from the gross amount (that is, without any deduction) of each payment made to the employee that constitutes income from employment.

- 1.5.3  If withholding at the highest personal income tax rate would cause excessive  tax  deduction  to  the  employee  because  none  of  the employee's total income for the year is likely to be taxed at that rate, the employee may apply to the Commissioner to allow a lower rate at which the secondary employer must withhold tax considering the applicable tax range on the employer's income.

## 1.6 EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATION TO FILE A STATEMENT  OF TAX WITHHELD

- 1.6.1  Every employer who is obliged to withhold tax from payments to their employees is required to file with the Commissioner a duly completed Form ITX215.01.E within 30 days after the end of each six-month calendar period. This form lets the Commissioner know the amounts which have been withheld from the employees and other information required to be submitted about the employees.
- 1.6.2  An employer must include in the Form ITX215.01.E a statement of employees  for  which  employment  with  the  employer  constitutes  a secondary employment. For this purpose an employer must enquire from  employees  (for  whom  they  are  a  primary  employer)  at  a maximum of six-monthly intervals whether the employee has another employment.
- 1.6.3  The employer is required to submit the duly completed PAYE-end of the year statement summary, form ITX215.01.E. on or before  31st January of the following year after the end of the calendar year.

## 1.7 EMPLOYER'S  OBLIGATION  TO  PROVIDE  A  WITHHOLDING CERTIFICATE

- 1.7.1 Every year an employer who has withheld tax or is liable to withhold tax under the PAYE system must prepare and serve on their employees a certificate stating the amount of employment income paid during the year and the amount of tax withheld from the payments.  This statement must be served on each employee by 30th January following the end of the year.

- 1.7.2  If the employment ends during the year the employer must serve such a certificate on the employee within 30 days after cessation of the employment.
- 1.7.3  The withholding certificate issued by the employer as per paragraph 1.7.2 above should be in the prescribed format.

## 1.8 OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN DOCUMENTS

- 1.8.1  Every employer is obliged to maintain the following tax documentation in Tanzania in paper or electronic form and make them available for inspection at the employer's premises or at such other places as may be notified by the Commissioner:
- (i)   wage sheets and salary vouchers; and
- (ii)    any other books, documents and records whatsoever relating to the calculation or payment of amounts to employees or tax withheld from such payments.
- 1.8.2  The employer must maintain the documentation for a period of five years  from  the  relevant  date  or  for  further  period  as  prescribed  in the law unless otherwise the Commissioner specifies by a notice in writing.
- 1.8.3  Where  any  of  the  documents  is  not  in  an  official  language  the Commissioner may require under a notice in writing, the employer to  provide  at  the  employer's  expense  a  translation  into  an  official language by a translator approved by the Commissioner.

- (b) a position of an individual as manager of an entity other than as partner of a partnership;
- (c) a position of an individual entitling the individual to a periodic remuneration in respect of services performed; or
- (d) a public office held by an individual; and includes a past, present and prospective employment.

- (ii) Persons  who  are  in  receipt of payment  for  prospective employment
- 2.1.3  'employer' means a person who conducts, has conducted or has the prospect of conducting the employment of an individual.
- 2.1.4  'full time service director' means a person at management position and is in full time service in a corporation.

## PART III

## 3.0 CALCULATION  OF  AMOUNTS TO BE  INCLUDED  IN CALCULATING EMPLOYMENT INCOME

## 3.1 CALCULATION OF MONTHLY PAY

'Monthly pay' means the aggregate of amounts paid to an employee of  the employer  or  an associate of  the  employer  during a month that must be included in calculating the employee's income from  employment. This amount constitutes 'monthly pay' whether or not the actual amount is payable weekly, monthly, annually or at any other shorter or longer intervals,

## 3.2  LUMP-SUM PAYMENTS AND PAYMENTS RELATING  TO MONTHS OR YEARS OTHER THAN MONTHS OR YEARS OF PAYMENTS

- 3.2.1  Lump-sum  payments  to  employees  may  take  the  form  of gratuities; leave  pay,  compensations,  bonus,  commissions etc. which may cover several months of the year or the whole of a year. Lump-sum payments other than  terminal  payments  should  be  included  in  the year of payment and be taxed on the basis of the adjusted monthly pay for the year of income.
- 3.2.2  Employees may also receive lump-sum payments other than terminal payments during a year that relate to other years. Such payments are  included  in  income  from  employment  and  therefore,  subject  to withholding in the year in which the payment is made. The payments must not be included in any other year or spread over more than one year.
- 3.2.3  Lump   sum   payments   including redundancy and other payments for  loss  or  termination  of  office,  shall  be  spread  over  a  maximum period of six years (or actual years) of employment and shall be taxed as income for these years. Regarding the spread back adjustments;

## 3.3 RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS

An employer may deduct an amount from an employee's wages and contribute it to a retirement fund on behalf of the employee.

'retirement  contribution'  means  a  payment  made  to  a  retirement  fund  for the  provision  or  future  provision  of  retirement  benefits.  These  retirement contributions are known as 'employee's contributions'.  The employer (or an associate  of  an  employer)  may  make  further  contributions  over  and  above the 'employee's contributions' on behalf of or for the benefit of an employee. These retirement contributions are known as 'employer's contributions'. The contribution may be in respect of an interest of the employee or a spouse of the employee in the retirement fund.

When  calculating  an  employee's  monthly  pay,  an  employer  should  at  first not  make any reduction for any employee's contributions and include in the calculation any employer contributions.

When the  employer  has  worked  out  the  contribution  amount  the  amount  is thereafter reduced. The amount of this reduction is equal to the lower of-

- (i) the  total  of  the  employee;  or  employer  contributions  where  it  is included in calculating the monthly pay made to approved retirement funds; and
- (ii) the statutory amount of the fund.

## 3.4 RETIREMENT PAYMENTS

This guide applies to retirement i.e payments, by way of lump sum pension or commuted pension made by employers (or their associates) directly to former employees after their retirement. This guide does not apply to the payment of other lump sums or pensions by persons who are not employers, e.g. those paid by retirement funds.

An  employer  must  withhold  tax  from  retirement  payments  made  to  former employees in the  same  way  as  tax  is  withheld  from  monthly  pay  to  current

employees, except terminal payments relating to other years of income

## 3.5 BENEFITS IN KIND

- 3.5.1  When  an  employer  provides  for  personal  needs  of  the  employee through providing the employee with goods or services, the use of assets, etc. (as opposed to money) these provisions are benefits in kind. All  payments  consisting  benefits  in  kind  must  be  included  in calculating  the  employee's monthly pay and are subject to income tax by withholding. It is the employer's responsibility to ensure that the tax due on the benefits in kind is withheld from the employee's cash wages (together with tax due with respect to those cash wages). The value of the benefits in kind is, in general, the market value of the benefit. This means the money that a person would have to pay on the market to receive the same or similar goods, service or other benefit. The amount of the value of the benefit must be included in the monthly pay of the employee (unless it is within the exempt amount).
- 3.5.2  The  following  special  rules  apply  for  calculating  the  value  of  the provision of motor vehicles, subsidized loans and housing benefits:

## Motor Vehicle

If  an  employer  provides  a  motor  vehicle  that  is  available  for  the private use of an employee, the private use benefit must be included in calculating the employee's monthly pay and is subject to income tax by withholding. An exception applies (and the amount is excluded in  calculating  monthly  pay)  where  the  employer  does  not  claim  a deduction  for  expenditure  on  the  motor  vehicle  in  respect  of  its ownership, maintenance or operation. If the exception does not apply, the benefit is quantified using the following table:

| Engine size of vehicle                  | Quantity of payment           | Quantity of payment           |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|                                         | Vehicle less than 5 years old | Vehicle more than 5 years old |
| Not exceeding 1000 cc                   | Shs. 250,000                  | Shs. 125,000                  |
| Above 1000 cc but not exceeding 2000 cc | Shs. 500,000                  | Shs. 250,000                  |
| Above 2000 cc but not exceeding 3000 cc | Shs. 1,000,000                | Shs. 500,000                  |
| Above 3000 cc                           | Shs. 1,500,000                | Shs. 750,000                  |

## Subsidized loans

An  employer  or  associate  of  the  employer  may  provide  a  loan  to an employee at no interest or at an interest rate that is below the commercial interest rate. In this case, if the loan is for a period of more than a year and the amount of the loan and any other loans to the employee is more than three months of the employee's basic salary, the  benefit  of  the  interest  forgone  must  be  included  in  calculating the employee's monthly pay. The value of the benefit is equal to the difference between the interest the employee pays (if any) and the amount that would have been paid using the commercial interest rate.

## Provision of housing

The value of housing provided to an employee by the employer is a taxable benefit and should be included in the employee's monthly pay. The value of housing is calculated as the market value of renting the  house  or  15%  of  the  rest  of  the  employee's  income  from  the employment, whichever is less. However, if the employer claims a deduction greater than the 15% amount with respect to this housing in calculating the employer's income (e.g. depreciation allowances and maintenance and utility bills), the value of the benefit is the amount of the deduction claimed by the employer or the rental market value, whichever is less.

See  Part  V  of  the  Guide  for  worked  examples  on  calculation of value  of housing benefit.

## Tax	benefit

Tax  benefit  occurs  when  the  employer  pays  tax  on  behalf  of  the employee. In this case, the amount of tax paid is treated as benefit in kind in hands of the employee that is tax on tax.

- 3.5.3  Some benefits in kind, such as the provision of a car or use of a house for residential occupation, are provided during the course of the year rather than at a particular time.  They are not easily attributed to a particular month.  For the purposes of income tax by withholding, the amount of the benefit is treated as paid to the employee proportionately over each month during which the payment or benefit is provided. Tax should be deducted based on the period or position of the premises occupied or benefits enjoyed by the employee.

## PART V

## 5.0     ASSESSMENT OF TAX

## 5.1 CALCULATION OF EMPLOYEE'S MONTHLY PAY

- 5.1.1 The monthly pay of an employee includes basic salary, allowances and benefits in kind and any other allowances received by the employee in  respect  of  the  employment  or  services  performed.    In  particular income from employment and, therefore, monthly pay includes:
- (i) Payments  of wages, salary, payment in lieu of leave, fees, commissions, bonus and gratuities
- (ii) Payments of any personal allowances, subsistence, rent, entertainment or travel allowance
- (iii) Payments for providing any discharge or reimbursement of expenditure incurred by an individual or by an associate of an individual
- (iv) Payment  for  an  individual's  agreement  to  any  conditions  of  the employment
- (v) Contributions made on behalf of the employee to retirement funds and retirement payments made by employers directly to employees
- (vi) Redundancy and other payments for loss or termination of employment relating to the year of payment (Current year of income)
- (vii)     Benefits in kind
- 5.1.2 In calculating an employee's income from employment (monthly pay) the following payments are excluded:
- (i) Amounts  specifically  exempt  under  the  Income  Tax  Act,  2004 and  payments  which  are  subject  to  a  final  withholding  tax  (wage withholding tax is not a final tax)
- (ii) On  premises  cafeteria services that are available on a nondiscriminatory basis
- (iii) Medical   services,   payment   for   medical   services and payment for insurances for medical services. These benefits are also excluded

from  income  from  employment  where  they  are  available  to  the employee's  spouse  and  up  to  four  of  their  children.  However,  the benefits  are  only  excluded  if  they  are  provided  to  all  employees (including the employees of associates of the employer conducting a similar or related business) on a non-discriminatory basis

- (iv) Any    subsistence,    travelling,    entertainment    or other allowance that  represents  reimbursement  of  expenditure    of    the    employee. This    exemption    is  only  available  if  the  employee's  expenditure was incurred    wholly    and    exclusively    in    the    production  of  the employee's income from the employment or services rendered under the employment.  See further paragraph 2.3 below
- (v) Benefits from the use of a motor vehicle where the employer does not  claim  any  deduction  in  relation  to  ownership,  maintenance  or operation of the motor vehicle
- (vi) Payments  providing  passage  of  the  employee,  spouse  of  the employee and up to four of their children between the employee's place  of  domicile  and  the  employee's  place  of  employment.    The payment  must  correspond  to  the  actual  travelling  cost.    Further, the employee must be domiciled more than twenty (20) miles from the place of employment and be recruited for employment solely in the service of the employer at the place of employment.  Any other payments for the personal travel of the employee or the employee's family must be included in the employee's monthly pay
- (vii) The use of residential premises by certain Government employees and  retirement  payments  and  retirement  contributions  exempted under the Public Service Retirement Benefits Act, 1999
- 5.1.3  The following may qualify for reimbursement of expenses mentioned under item (iv) of paragraph 5.2:
- (i) Subsistence allowance;
- (ii) Disturbance and luggage allowance;
- (iii) Scholarship  or  education  grant  payable  to  a  student employee

- (iv)   Outfit allowance
- (v)    Foreign allowance
- 5.1.4  Even where payments referred  to  in  paragraph  5.1.3  above are excluded from monthly pay, those payments should be shown in any return of wages that is to be submitted to the Commissioner.
- 5.1.5   Travelling or car mileage paid or reimbursed to an employee for home to office journeys should be taxed in full.
- 5.1.6  Round-sum expense allowances are in all cases taxable. Employees who receive such allowances are advised to contact their nearest TRA Office to arrange for appropriate 'tax free' portion of the allowance. This tax free portion will represent an estimate of the amount of the allowance that is exempt as referred to in paragraph 2.2 above. In the absence of authorization of a tax free portion by the Commissioner the employer should withhold tax on the full amount of the payment.
- 5.1.7  The total amount arrived at under the previous paragraphs under this heading is then reduced (within limits)  by  employee  and  employer contributions  to  approved  retirement  funds.  See  further  heading 4 below.  No other reduction or deduction is allowed in calculating income from employment and, therefore, monthly pay.

## 5.2 WITHHOLDING OF TAX FROM EMPLOYEE'S MONTHLY PAY

The monthly tax to be withheld from an employee's monthly pay is, as a rule, computed with reference to the tax rates prescribed in the First Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 2004.  As a general rule, the monthly tax is calculated by multiplying the monthly pay by twelve, applying the rates in the First Schedule and dividing the resultant amount by twelve. The Tanzania Revenue Authority publishes  useful  tax  tables  to  assist  in  this  calculation.    Using  these  tables, the employer looks up the employee's monthly pay and withholds as tax the corresponding amount mentioned in the tables.

## 5.3 THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS

It follows, therefore, that if the monthly pay is constant throughout the year of income, the aggregate monthly tax computed under paragraph 5.2 above is the same as the annual tax computed under paragraph 5.1 above. However, if the monthly pay fluctuates or the income is earned for part of the year only it will be necessary to make adjustments. This is in order to ensure that the aggregate amount of tax withheld during the year is equal to the employee's annual tax liability for  the  year  (assuming  the  employee  has  no  other  source  of  assessable income). When the change in monthly pay takes place, a calculation of revised withholding amounts should immediately be made for the remaining part of the year. This revision should result in the correct total tax being paid by the end of the year. Fluctuations or changes in monthly pay may take place particularly as a result of the following:

- (i)         New employment
- (ii)        Cessation of employment
- (iii)        Change of employment
- (iv)       Change in monthly payment amounts
- (v) Lump sum payments  by  way  of  bonus,  gratuity,  arrears  of  salary, commission,  payment  in  lieu  of  leave,  pay  in  lieu  of  notice  of termination of employment, etc.
- To  produce  the  desired  tax  withholding  adjustments  the  following general mechanism should be applied:
- (i) Estimate  the  new  aggregate  of  the  employee's  income from  employment  for  the  year  (after  accounting  for  any contributions to approved retirement funds)
- (ii) Based on that estimate, calculate the estimated tax payable on that income using the rates and thresholds in the First Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 2004

- (iii)        Use the following formula to calculate the withholding for the month of change:

<!-- image -->

## where-

- A      is the monthly pay for the month;
- B is  the  employee's  tax  liability  for  the  year  in  (ii)  less  the aggregate of all tax previously withheld from the employee's monthly pay during the current year; and
- C is  the  employee's  income  from  employment  for  the  year in (i) less the aggregate of all monthly pay received by the employee during the current year prior to the current month
- (iv) If  the  monthly  pay  for  subsequent  months of the year is the same as  that  of  the  month  of  change,  withhold  the  same  amount  from each subsequent monthly pay for the year. If the monthly pay for a subsequent month is different, reapply steps (i) to (iii) to produce the correct amount of withholding

These computations if correctly carried out will avoid over or under withholding.

If it is not possible to adjust the withholding and there is an over or under payment at the end of the year, employers should correct the situation as stated under the end of the year adjustments in this guide.

## 5.4 END OF THE MONTH ADJUSTMENTS

In  every  month  when  the  change  in  income  from  employment takes place:

- (i) If the date of effecting the revised withholding does not coincide with the new pay circumstances, the employers must remember that the

date for effecting the salary adjustments will not be the same as the date of commencing the revised withholding.

- (ii) When   the   revised   withholding   bears   no   direct proportion to the  actual  pay  it  is  important  to  remember  that  the  actual  monthly pay and the revised monthly tax withholding are entered in the Tax Withholding  Statement  at  the  appropriate  spaces  accordingly.  In carrying out the monthly adjustment employers must first assume that the change in income will remain constant until the end of the year unless another change takes place, in which case, readjustment on the same principles must be done again.

The Tax Withholding Statement provides a space for indicating the date when the new salary commenced. Employers are requested to mark the date(s) accordingly.

End of the month adjustment will also include checking and correcting arithmetical or other errors.

## 5.5  END OF THE YEAR ADJUSTMENTS

- 5.5.1  An individual's income tax liability is calculated on an annual basis. In general, this is done by applying the rates mentioned in the First Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 2004 to the individual's total income for the year of income.  In the case of an employee, the year of income is the calendar year.
- 5.5.2  End of the year adjustments are essentially intended to deal with any over or under withholding that occurred during the year.
- 5.5.3  When it is discovered that there is an over withholding the excess will  be  carried  forward  for  off-set  against  the  following  January withholding  and  any  excess  still  unabsorbed  against  the  following months' withholding. If an employee however, opts to get a refund in respect of PAYE over withholding, the employee should be directed to

the TRA Office in which case no carry forward by the employer should be made.

- 5.5.4  On the other hand, if the review shows an under withholding the deficit should  be  carried  forward  and  recovered  together  with  the  normal monthly withholding in the following year.
- (i) Hardship cases should be referred to the TRA Office but installments will not be granted beyond 30th June of the following year
- (ii) Where there is  under  withholding  of  tax  and  the  employee  leaves the services of the employer, the entire amount must be recovered in full from the employee's final pay. If the employee leaves in such circumstances that the employer cannot recover the amount of under withholding the case should be reported to TRA Office immediately with full particulars.

The Commissioner shall issue instructions regarding an end of the year reconciliation to enable the appropriate amount of tax withheld from employment is paid and entry made to the end of year reconciliation.

## 5.6 EXAMPLES

## Example 1

The company has only one employee for the year of income.

The following is his monthly emoluments:

-  Basic Salary                           400,000/=

- Transport allowance                250,000/=

-  Lunch allowance                    150,000/=

- Medical allowance

50,000/=

Total monthly pay               Sh. 850,000/=

What is withholding amount per month?

Solution:      Using the applicable tax rates (w.e.f July 2017)

Tax per month is sh. 137,100/=

Note:    Assuming the emoluments are constant for the whole year, the tax for the year of income will be:

137,100x 12  = Sh. 1,645,200/=

## Example 2

Refer to example 1

- (a)      Assume that the employer houses the employee freely.

Suppose the market value of rental at that area is Shs.200,000/= per month and the expenditure claimed by the company for that premises is 150,000/= per month.

## Solution:

- (i) Compare 15% of the employees monthly pay (excluding the housing benefit)  with  the  expenditure  claimed  by  the  employer.  Take  the greater ;

i.e 15% x 850,000 = 127,500

While the expenditure claimed is 150,000/= you take 150,000/=

- (ii) Compare the market value rent which is 200,000/= and 150,000/= (result from (i)). Take the lesser, which is 150,000/=.

Tax computation:

Total emoluments (refer to example 1)                850,000/=

Add housing benefit                                            150,000/=

Total monthly pay                                     Shs  1,000,000/=

Using  the  applicable  tax  rates  (w.e.f  July  2016)  Tax  per  month  is  Shs 182,100/=

- (b)        Refer to (a) above.

Assume the employee contributes Shs. 50,000/= as rent per month. The housing benefit will be:

## Solution:

Housing benefit computed in (a) above                150,000/=

Less amount paid by employee                              50,000/=

Total                                         100,000/=

Tax computation:

Total emoluments                       850,000/=

Add Housing benefit                  100,000/=

Total monthly pay              Shs.   950,000/=

Using tax rates as per tax tables (July 2016) Tax per month is   Shs 167,100/=

## Example 3

Refer to example 1

Beside the emoluments stated in example 1, the employee also receives the following benefits:

- (i) Self  drive  car  for  private  use,  which  is  3000  cc,  brand  new.  The company claims expenditure of car maintenance.
- (ii) Loan advances of Shs. 3,000,000 to be repaid in 24 months and free
- of interest.

(Assume the statutory interest rate is 12% p.a.)

- (iii)    Other benefits:

-  Electricity                 50,000/= pm

-  Water                       20,000/= pm

Solution:

Total emoluments

(refer to example 1)                   850,000/=

Add

-    Car benefit (s. 27 R/W 5th  Schedule)

Annual (cc 3000) = 1,000,000/=

Per month = divide by 12               83,333/=

-     Loan interest (s. 27)

Interest per statutory rate

12% x 3,000,000/= = 36,000/=p.a.

Less interest paid         NIL

Per month = divide by 12

3,000/=

-  Other benefits:

-  Electricity                          50,000/=

Water                                        20,000/=

Total monthly pay

Shs. 1,006,333/=

Using the applicable tax rates

Tax per month is    Shs. 183,999.90/=

Note:    Assuming the emoluments are constant for the whole year, the tax for the year of income will be:

183,999.90 x 12 =   Shs. 2,207,998.80

## Example: 4

Retirement contributions.

Refer to example 1

If the employer contributes 15 % of basic salary to an approved retirement fund and the employee contributes 5 %, then monthly pay will be calculated as follows:

Solution:

Total emoluments

(refer to example 1)

850,000/=

Add contributions by employer

400,000/= x 15%  =                                60,000/=

910,000/=

## Less

-        Employer's contributions                60,000/=

-        Employee's contributions 400,000/= x 5% =                           20,000/=

Total monthly pay                           Shs. 830,000/=

Using the applicable tax rates

Tax per month is Ths 131,100/=

In calculating monthly pay for employer and employee contributions is limited.

The reduction  is  limited  to  the  statutory  amount  to  be  contributed  to  the fund.  No reduction is available for contributions to a retirement fund that is not approved.

## Example: 5 - Termination of employment

An employee is paid by the employer Sh. 28,000,000/= for termination of the employment in the year 2007 when the employment actually ceased. The payment relates to years 2005 to 2015, inclusive and is allocated by the  employer  as  Sh.  2,000,000  for  each  of  the  years  2005  to  2010  and Sh.2,500,000  for  2011,  and  2012  and  Sh.  3,000,000  years  2013,  2014 and 2015.  Allocate the terminal payment for calculating income tax of the employee.

## Solution

For calculating the income of the employee the terminal payment is treated as follows:

The employer has allocated the payment as follows

| Year   | 2005   | 2006   | 2007   | 2008   | 2009   | 2010   | 2011   | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Amount | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.5m   | 2.5m   | 3.0m   | 3.0m   | 3.0m   |

- · Under section 7(4) the income for years 2005 to 2010 (Sh. 12.0m) is to be allocated equally over the prior six years to 2015 i.e. Sh. 2.0m for each year.
- •         The allocation for calculating tax purposes is as follows

| Year                      | 2010   | 2011   | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   |
|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Income spread back (Shs.) | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.0m   | 2.0m   |
| Allocated (Shs.)          | 2.0m   | 2.5m   | 2.5m   | 3.0m   | 3.0m   | 3.0m   |

The income as reallocated is assessable in the six years between 2010 and 2015, additional to any income previously declared or assessed. No terminal payment will be assessed for years 2005 to 2009.

## Example: 6

Compensation for the termination of contract

Payments received as compensation for the termination of any contract of employment or services rendered, whether or not provision is made in such contract for the payment of such compensation is taxed in accordance with the provisions of section 7(5) as follows:

- (a) If  the contract is for a specified term, the amount to be included in calculating  the  gains  or  profit  shall  not  exceed  the  amount  which would  have  been  received  in  respect  of  the  unexpired  period  of such contract and shall be deemed to have accrued evenly in such unexpired period.

An  employee  who  has  a  contract  of  employment  for  five  years from  1/1/2011  to  31/12/2015  is  having  the  contract  terminated on  31/12/2012  and  paid  Sh.  72,000,000  for  the  termination  of  the contract.

The compensation amount of Sh. 72,000,000 shall be allocated evenly over the unexpired period of the contract, i.e. 1st January, 2013 to 31st December, 2015, as Sh. 24,000,000 for each of the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.  None of the amount shall be allocated to the expired period of the contract.

- (b) If the contract is for unspecified term and provides for compensation on termination thereof, such compensation shall be deemed to have accrued in the period immediately following such termination at a rate equal to the rate per annum, of the gains from the contract received immediately prior to such termination.

Payments  for  the  compensation  of  a  contract  of  unspecified  term shall be allocated to the period immediately after the termination at the rate per annum of the income received in respect of the contract immediately before the termination.

## Example 7

An employee had  a  contract  of  employment  for  unspecified  period which  provided  for  compensation  on  termination.        The  contract was terminated on 31st December, 2011. During the year 2011 the employee was receiving gross remuneration of Sh. 18,000,000.  On 4th January, 2012 the employee received as compensation for the termination of the contract a payment of Sh. 58,000,000.

For purpose of calculating the employee's income tax, the payment will be allocated evenly for the period immediately after such termination at the annual rate of the income the employee received immediately before the termination as follows:

Salary for year 2011                                  Sh.  18,000,000

Compensation payment year 2012           Sh. 18,000,000

Compensation payment year 2013           Sh. 18,000,000

Compensation payment year 2014           Sh. 18,000,000

Compensation payment year 2015           Sh.   4,000,000

The compensation payment of Sh. 58,000,000 will be assessed for years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 as shown above.

- (c) If  the  contract  is  for  an  unspecified  term  and  does  not  provide  for compensation on its termination any compensation amount received shall be deemed to accrue in the period immediately following such termination  at  a  rate  equal  to  the  gain  of  such  contract  received immediately prior to such termination but the amount shall not exceed three years remuneration at such rate.

## Example: 8

An  employee  had  a  contract  of  employment  of  unspecified  period which did not provide for compensation on its termination. The contract was terminated on 31st December, 2011.  During the year 2011 the employee received from the contracted employment Sh.18,000,000. On  4th  January,  2012  the  employee  received  a  payment  for  the compensation of the contract of Sh. 58,000,000.

For purposes of calculating the employee's income tax the compensation payment shall be deemed to have accrued in the period immediately after the termination and based on the rate of payment received immediately before such termination exceed the amount of three years remuneration as follows

Salary for year 2011                                Sh. 18,000,000

Compensation payment year 2012         Sh. 18,000,000

Compensation payment year 2013         Sh. 18,000,000

Compensation payment year 2014         Sh. 18,000,000

Compensation payment year 2015   Sh.   4,000,000 (not taxable)

The compensation payment will be assessed for years 2012, 2013 and 2014 at Sh.18,000,000 for each year. The balance of Sh. 4,000,000 will not be taxed.

## PART VI

## 6.0 WITHHOLDING AND REMITTANCE OF TAX

## 6.1 GENERAL

The Tax Administration Act 2015 requires an employer to remit tax withheld from his employees within seven days from the end of the month during which the monthly pay is paid.  Failure to observe this requirement will render the employer liable to the tax liability with penalty.

## 6.2 REMITTANCE OF TAX

Employers MUST make remittances of tax withheld through banks. The following arrangements refer to remittance through banks:

- (i)     Remittances are  made  by  use  of  paying  in  slips. Remittances must be made with the bank with which the employer maintains an account.
- (ii) Pay in  slips  to  be  submitted  to  the TRA  Office within the time limit.
- (iii)   All copies of the paying in-slip should be completed in detail. figures should not be erased or tampered with
- (v) Employers must ensure that all the copies of paying in-slips have been stamped and signed by the bank teller or cashier

## 6.3 SPECIAL CONCESSION FOR REMOTE AREAS

- 7.1.2  The employee having more than one employment  shall select (at the employee's choice) one of those employments to be the employee's primary employment  and  the remaining employment  shall be secondary employment.
- 7.1.3. Secondary  employers  should  apply  similar  process  as  primary employer in determining monthly pay and deduction of tax. However, secondary employers do not use progressive rates and the income tax tables to calculate the amount of tax to be withheld from monthly pay. Secondary employers must withhold tax at  the  highest individual rate (currently 30%) from the full amount of monthly pay.

## 7.2 IRREGULAR PAYMENTS

- 7.2.1  PAYE must be withheld from payments made to employees during a month. Thus, if employees are paid weekly, fortnightly or at any other interval, the entry for pay on the tax withholding statement should be the total of the payments in the month and the tax due on the whole monthly pay should usually be withheld proportionately from each pay made during the month. However, it is also acceptable to deduct all the tax for the month from the last pay to the employee for the month.
- 7.2.2  Where, exceptionally  insufficient  tax  is  withheld  during  a month, the employer must recover the balance from the next payment of salary etc. to the employee.

- 7.2.3  Where a payment or benefit to be included in calculating an employee's income from employment is not easily attributed to a particular month (such as the use of a motor vehicle or house) then the amount is treated  as  paid  to  the  employee  proportionately  over  each  month during  which  the  payment  or  benefit  is  provided.  Employers  are reminded that benefits in kind are quantified under section 27 and Fifth Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 2004.

## 7.3 NON-RESIDENT EMPLOYEES PAYMENTS

In the case of non-resident employees, the employer must withhold tax at the flat rate of 15% from monthly pay. This withholding satisfies the tax liability of the employee.

## 7.4 FULL TIME SERVICE DIRECTOR FEES

In the case of director's fees payable to a full time service director the employer will withhold tax at the rate of 15% of the amount of the fee payable.

## PART VIII

- 9.2.2  Where this rule applies the employer after the change shall, in relation to any matter arising after the change, be liable to do anything which the employer before the change would have been liable to do if the change  had  not  taken  place,  provided  that  the  employer  after  the change shall not be liable for the payment of any tax which should have been withheld from emoluments paid to the employee before the change took place unless there is an agreement.
- 9.2.3  Additionally, there are cases where the company's name changes e.g from Dogo  Co. to  Kubwa  Co. while the ownership remain unchanged. In this case such changes should as well be communicated to the Commissioner.
