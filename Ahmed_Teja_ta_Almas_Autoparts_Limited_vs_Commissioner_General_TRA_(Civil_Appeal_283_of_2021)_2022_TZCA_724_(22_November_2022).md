## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

8t h  &amp; 22n d  November, 2022

## KITUSI. J.A.:

The  appellant intends to appeal against  the decision of  the respondent  rejecting  his objection  to tax  assessments.  However,  as  he was  late  in  doing  so,  he  applied  to  the Tax  Appeals  Board  (Board)  for extension of time in terms of section  16 (5) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act  Cap  408,  (the  Act)  citing  illness  as  the  reason  for  the  delay.  That application  was  dismissed, and  so  was  the  appeal before  the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal) intended to challenge the dismissal by  the  Board.  This  is  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Tribunal dismissing the appeal.

Essentially, there is one  issue  for  our  determination, namely whether the decision of the Board dismissing the application and that of the Tribunal dismissing the appeal were erroneous. In refusing to extend time,  both  the  Board  and  the  Tribunal  took  the  view  that  when  the appellant was taken ill on 8th  December, 2017 as alleged by him, he was already out of time counting from 31s t August 2017 when the objection was rejected by the respondent.

Caselaw is settled that extension of time is in the discretion of the court. See Paradise Holiday Resort Limited v. Theodore N. Lyimo, Civil Application No. 435/01 of 2018 (unreported). In order therefore, for the appellant to succeed here, he has to persuade us that the Board and the Tribunal on appeal did not exercise their discretion judicially.

This  appeal  is  mainly  on  the  same  argument  as  reflected  by the first ground of appeal which reads:-

"i. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals  Tribunal erred in  law  by  holding  that  the  appellant's  sickness could hardly be a cause for his delay to lodge with the Board the intended appeal"

The  appellant  prosecuted  the  appeal  in  person  by  adopting  the written  submissions  that  had  earlier  been  drawn  and  lodged  by  Mr.

Mustapha Said Nassoro, learned advocate. It appeared that the appellant and that advocate had parted ways, so he opted to proceed on his own  and  in  doing  so  he  did not  add  anything  to  the  written submissions.  On  the other  hand,  the  respondent appeared  through  Mr. Leyan  Sabore,  learned  State  Attorney. He  also  adopted  the  written submissions which he had earlier lodged  in opposition of the appeal.  He too did not have an additional oral address.

As we intimated earlier, the same issue is being presented for our determination  again. First, in order  to put  matters  in their proper perspectives,  we  ask  whether  the  Tribunal  really  stated  what  is  being alleged  in  the  first  ground  of  appeal  that  '! sickness  could hardly be a cause for his delay... "\N\Xh  respect, the learned Vice Chairperson of the Tribunal  did  not  say  anything  of  that  sort.  Rather  the  Board,  having found that by the time the appellant fell ill he was already out of time, it observed that:-"... the applicant's sickness o f 8th  December, 2017 could hardly be a cause for his delay.

It  is  to be  noted  that  section 16  (5)  of  the  Act  is  clear  that extension  of time  may  be  granted  on  ground  of  illness,  therefore  the Board  would  not  have  stated  what  it  is  alleged  in  ground  1   above. However,  we  cannot  fault  the  findings  of  the  Board  and  that  of  the

Tribunal that the alleged  illness of 8th   December,  2017 was irrelevant in accounting  for  the  delay  counted  from  31s t  August,  2017  because  we agree with their finding that long  before the appellant was taken  ill,  he was time barred in appealing. For that reason, the first ground of appeal has no merit and must be dismissed.

Instead  of proceeding to consider grounds 2 and  3,  we shall  now consider ground 4. This is because the appellant has abandoned ground 3  and  that  given  the  nature  of  the  complaint  in  ground  2,  we  shall consider it last in passing. Ground 4 states:-

" That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law in holding that the appellant was well informed on  the rejection o f his notice o f objection on 31st August  2017  in  the  absence  o f  such  evidence (letter dated  31st August 2017)".

The  appellant  argued  before  the  Board  and  Tribunal  and  has continued  to  argue  before  us that there  was  no  proof that  he  became aware of the rejection of the objection earlier than  18th  December, 2017. He  relied  on  the  respondent's  letter  dated  14th   December,  2017  which he claims he received on  18th  December, 2017.

In  rejecting  this  argument,  the  Tribunal  observed  that  the  letter dated 14th   December, 2017 was a mere reminder as it cited the letter of 31s t   August,  2017.  Before  us,  the  appellant  argued  that  the  Tribunal ought  to  have  called  evidence  to  satisfy  itself  if  the  letter  dated  31s t August,  2017  did,  in  fact,  exist.  The  respondent's  counsel  argued  that this  point  was  not  raised  before  the  Board  for  it  to  determine.  Citing section  16  (4)  of the  Act,  he  argued  that the  Tribunal  could  not  have decided on a point that was not decided upon by the Board.

We  find  the  appellant's  argument  that  he  became  aware  of the rejection  on  18th   December,  2017  to  be  self-defeating,  because  before the Board, the affidavit taken in support of the application only  cited the illness of 8th   December 2017 as the  reason  for the delay.  We  need  not remind  the  appellant  that  affidavits,  which  are  statements  made  on oath,  are the basis upon which applications are decided. Any statement not  raised  in  affidavit  is  always  disregarded  as  a  mere  statement from the  bar.  We  reiterate what we  stated  in Richard  Mchau v.  Shabir F. Abdulhussein Civil Application No. 87 of 2008 (unreported), that:-

"It is our considered view that if   the applicant was served out o f time, he  would not have  failed to raise  such  an  alarm  in  the  affidavit  Having  not done so,  we think,  the respondent's contention to

## the effect  that  the  applicant's  assertion is an afterthought holds a lot o f  water"

Similarly,  in  this case, the alleged  late service of notification  must have been an afterthought because it is inconceivable that the appellant would  not  raise  that  fact  in  the  supporting  affidavit  and  instead  raised the issue of illness on  dates that bear no  relevancy.  In arguing that the Tribunal ought to have called evidence, the appellant in effect acknowledges  that  there  was  none  presented  by  him  for  the  court's determination.  Since  cases  belong  to the  parties  it  is for them,  not the court,  to  prove  relevant  facts.  See Anthony  M.  Masanga  v.  Penina Mama  Mgesi  and  Lucia  Mama Anna, Civil  Appeal  No.  118  of  2014 (unreported). This ground is also devoid of merit, and is dismissed.

We shall  now deal  with  ground  2,  alleging that the appellant was denied the right to be heard. The appellant cited the Constitution of the United  Republic of Tanzania,  1977 and caselaw to argue that the denial of  extension  of  time  denied  him  the  right  to  be  heard  on  the  main grievance.  He cited EX D 8656 CPL Senga Idd Nyembo &amp; Others v. Republic Criminal  Application  No.  16  of  2018, National  Insurance Corporation  Ltd  v.  Shengena  Ltd, Civil  Application  No.230  of  2015

and DPP  v.  Yassin  Hassan, Criminal  Appeeal  No.  202  of  2019  (all unreported).

The  respondent's  counsel  submitted  that the  cited  cases  are  not relevant to  the  instant case.  He  further  submitted  that  the  decision  by the  respondent was according  to tax  laws,  and  failure  by the  appellant to  challenge  it  within  the  time  prescribed  by  law  cannot  be  said  to constitute denial of the right to be heard.

With respect, we do not go along with the appellant on this point. For one, sub article (3) of article  13 of the Constitution provides that the courts shall safeguard the rights and duties of citizens according to law, so  the  appellant's  right  to  be  heard  should  be  exercised  according  to law.  In Golden  Globe  International  Services  Ltd  &amp;  Another  v. Millicom  Tanzania  N.V  &amp;  4  Others, Civil  Application  No  441/01  of 2018  (unreported),  we  adopted  the  following  statement  made  by  the High Court in Afriscan Group (T) Limited v. Said Msangi, Commercial Case No. 87 of 2013 (unreported)

'The right to be heard  ju st like other rights,  must be exercised within the confines o f  the taw so as to avoid further breach o f  justice"

We  reiterate  that  position  and  we  dismiss  ground  2  for  being misconceived and  lacking  merit.  Consequently, for the reasons we have shown, this appeal is dismissed with costs.

It is so ordered.
