(Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal at Dar es Salaam

## (Mataka- Vice Chairman)

Dated the 4th  day of August, 2011 in Tax Appeal No. 5 of 2011

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

copy of the software and software licence of Ericsson AB which is similar to that  of  Alcatel  France  was  admitted  in  evidence  by  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) as exhibit Al.

Later in the year 2008, the respondent, Commissioner General of the Tanzania Revenue Authority, after having conducted a tax audit in respect of the appellant's accounts for the year 2004 demanded an amount of TZS 217.905.341.00 as withholding tax in the form  of royalty arising from the payments  made  to  the  two  foreign  companies  for  the  purchase  of  the software and software licence. The respondent demanded TZS 166.023.117.00  as  principal  tax  and  TZS  51,882,224.00  as  interest.  The demand was made vide certificate No. WHT/CSL/8/5/2010.

The appellant objected to the demand on account that the payments did  not constitute  royalty.  It successful  lodged  its complaint in  the Board, Income Tax Appeal No. DSM 31 of 2010. The respondent was aggrieved by the decision of the Board and thus appealed to the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (the  Tribunal)  which  allowed  the  appeal.  In  its  decision,  the Tribunal  held  that  the  payments  constituted  royalty  as  defined  under section 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1973  (ITA  1973) and section 3 of the Income Tax Act,  2004  (ITA  2004)  and  therefore,  the  appellant ought to

have deducted the  payable amount and  remit  it to the  respondent.  Both the  ITA  1973  and  the  subsequently  enacted  ITA  2004  which  came  into operation on  1/7/2004 were applicable to the payments because, whereas the  1 s t   payment was  made between  February and June,  2004 the second one was made after 1/7/2004 hence the application of the two Acts to the dispute  giving  rise  to  the  appeal.  In  its  judgment  at  page  260  of  the record, the Tribunal observed as follows:-

"Alcatel France and Ericsson AB are the owners of the protected software that Ceftel (T) needed to be able to provide mobife telephone services. Celtei was licensed to use the said software (programs) and duly paid the two owners for that access and right to use.  The receipt of that payment, called royalty, constituted business i ncome  on  which  the  law required the  earners  to pay i ncome tax : "

The appellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the Tribunal  hence this appeal which is predicated on the following four grounds:-

- "1 . The Hon Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal)  erred in  law by ignoring  to  determine an issue brought before it namely; the relevance of the authorities placed before it  which  if considered the

Tribunal would have decided the matter in favour of the Appellant.

- 2.  The Hon.  Tribunal erred  in law and  fact  in holding that the computer software in issue purchased from two foreign companies are intangible intellectual property which  is  protected  through  patent  arrangements without  any evidence in support of  the finding.
- 3.  That the Hon.  Tribunal erred in law by holding that the mere right to use software program constituted use of  copyright, giving rise to royalty.
- 4. The Hon.  Tribunal erred in fact and law by holding that payments made for the purchase of computer software licence were subject to withholding Tax on Royalty in terms of  S. 2 (1) (a) and (2 (1) (d) of  the Income  Tax Act No.  33 of 1973 hence allowing the Appeal before it "

At the  hearing  of the appeal,  the appellant was  represented  by  Dr. Alex  Nguluma,  learned  counsel  while the  respondent was  represented  by Mr.  Noah  Tito,  learned  counsel.  The  learned  advocates  for the  appellant and the respondent complied with the requirements of Rule 106(1) and (8) of the Tanzania Court of Appeals Rules, 2009 as amended by GN. No. 362

of  2017  by  filing  their  respective  written  submissions  in  support  of  the appeal and the reply thereto.

Dr.  Nguluma argued together the  1s t ,  2n d  and  3r d  grounds of appeal. In his written submission which he highlighted during his oral submission in Court/  he  mainly  contended  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  holding  that  the payments  made  for  the  purchase  of  computer  software  and  software licence were subject to withholding tax on  royalty in accordance with the provisions of section  2(1)  (a)  and  (d)  of the  ITA  1973.  According  to  the learned counsel, the finding by the Tribunal that the computer software "is i ntangible intellectual property which is protected through patent arrangements is erroneous  because  that  finding is not  supported by evidence.

Relying  on  the  definition  of  the  word  "patent"  in Black's  Law Dictionary, 10t h Edn.,  Thomson  Reuters,  the  provisions  of  the  Patents (Registration)  Act  [Cap  217  R.E.  2002]  and  Copyright  and  Neighbouring Rights Act [Cap.  218  R.E.  2002], the appellant's counsel  submitted firstly, that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  its  finding  because  neither  was  evidence  of existence  of a  patent  produced  nor was  it established,  under  any  of the two legislation cited above, that the software was an intellectual  property.

Secondly,  the  learned  counsel  challenged  the  Tribunal's  finding  that  the payments were subject to withholding tax.

He contended that the definition of the term "royalty" under S.  2  of the  ITA,  1973  and  S.3  of the  ITA  2004  do  not  cover  the  transaction  at issue.  He thus argued that, since both Acts do not provide for guidance on the  application  of the term  royalty,  a  recourse  should  have  been  had  to international sources for  guidance.

He contended that the  Organization  for  Economic Cooperation  and Development  (OECD)  Commentary  on  the  Model  Tax  Convection  on Income  and  Capital  (hereinafter  "the  OECD  Commentary")  should  have been resorted to for guidance on characterization of the payments at issue. It was Dr. Nguluma's stance that, since the definition of the term royalty in the  1973 and 2004 ITA is similar to that which is provided in Article  12 of the OECD Commentary,  in terms of paragraphs  12.2.  and  14.2 thereof,  it should have been found that the payments did  not constitute royalty. The learned counsel states as follows at page 8 of his written submission.

"These  explanations  [in  paragraphs  12.2  and  14.2] makes it dear that a payment for software which is for the acquirer's own use,  and which does not confer any rights  that  would  otherwise  be  an  infringement  of a

copyright  (such  as  copying  the  program  for  sale  or distribution to other person is not a  ' royalty'  as defined falling within Article 12 of the Mode! convention. Such a payment is instead  part of  normal  business profits falling within  Article 7  o f  the ModeI  convention."

Making  reference  to  the  Country  Frame  Contract  (exhibit  Al),  Dr. Nguluma argued that since the appellant's  rights in  both  Ericsson AB and Alcatel France is only for its own  use and without a right to copy or modify the software or make it available to any other person, the payments do not fall under the definition of royalty and thus not subject to withholding tax.

He challenged the submission made by the respondent's counsel and acted upon by both the Board and the Tribunal, that the provisions of S. 2 (1)  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  of  ITA  1973  were  applicable  to  the  nature  of  the payments  in  question  even  though  the  same  were  not for  the  use  of a copyright. According to the respondent's  counsel the said provisions capture the nature of payments in this case because, if the Parliament had intended otherwise, the word "copyright" should also have been inserted in those  paragraphs  as  without  that  word, royalty would not  arise  for payments made  in respect of  the items described under the said paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of S. 2 (1) of the ITA 1973.

Dr.  Nguluma contended that the said paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) are intended to capture royalty in the use of "art", "Science" and "technology" as  described  in  those  paragraphs.  He  stressed  however,  that  the  words appearing at the end of paragraph (d) cannot apply to subsection (1) (a) of that section. The relevant part of paragraph (d) states as follows

"... or for information concerning Industrial,  Commerciai or Scientific equipment or experience, and  includes  gains derived  from  the  sale  or  exchange  of any  right  or property  giving rise to such royalty."

According to the  learned  counsel,  royalty would  be  payable for the  items mentioned  in  paragraphs  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  without  inclusion  of the  word "copyright" because copyright do not necessarily apply to the items stated in those paragraphs.

Relying  also  on  the  meaning  of  the  word  "copyright"  as  defined under  S.3   of the  Copyright and  Neighbouring  Rights  Act,  the  appellant's counsel  submitted  that  the  use  of  that  word  is  crucial  in  determining whether or not payments were subject to withholding tax.

Dr.  Nguluma went on to argue that, since in terms of paragraphs 8.2 and  8.4 of the Agreement the  computer software  was  not transferred  to

the appellant  but instead,  the appellant was granted the  right to  use the computer  software, the payments  did not  constitute royalty as per paragraphs 12 and 14 of the OECD Commentary or the ITA 1973. He gave an  example of a  text  book which  is  protected  by a  copyright and  stated that the use of such a book is different from copying and selling its copies which would amount to infringement of copyright. In the circumstances, he said,  the  payments  made  by  the  appellant  amounted  to  a  purchase  of goods.  To  bolster  his  argument that  in  this  case,  the  payments  did  not constitute royalty, the learned counsel referred the Court to the decision of the  Income Tax  Appellate  Tribunal  of  India,  Delhi  Bench  in  the  case  of Infra Soft Ltd. v. Assistant Director of Tax India, 2009 which he cited during the hearing before the Board as a persuasive authority.  He stressed that, like in that case, the position in the present case is that the payments could not be taxed as royalty but rather, as business income.

On  the  cases  of Bulyanhulu  Gold  Mine  Ltd  v.  Commissioner General  (TRA), Consolidated  Civil  Appeals  No.  89  and  90  of  2015, Tullow Tanzania  BV v.  Commissioner General,  Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  24  of  2018  (both  unreported)  cited  by  the respondent's counsel in his reply submission and the case of BP Tanzania

## v. The Commissioner General of the Tanzania Revenue Authority,

Civil  Appeal  No.  125  of  2015  (unreported)  which  was  cited  by  the  said learned counsel at the hearing of the appeal,  Dr.  Nguluma submitted that the  decisions  do  not  apply  to  the  particular  facts  of  the  present  case because while in Bulyanhulu Gold  Mine  Ltd (supra) case the claimed tax was in  respect of disallowance of expenditure,  in the other two cases, the tax related to consultancy services.

With regard to the 4t h  ground, Dr. Nguluma submitted briefly, that, S . 2(1) (d) of ITA 1973 does not apply to the payments made by the two off­ shore companies because  a computer  software is not an industrial equipment.  He  contended  that  from  the  definition  in Collins  Cobuild English  Dictionary, 1995  Edn,  "equipment"  is  a  tangible  thing  and therefore, the description under the provisions S . 2(1) (d) of the ITA 1973 does not cover a computer software which is an intangible thing.

In  his  reply  submission  which  he  also  highlighted  them  in  his  oral submission,  Mr.  Tito  opposed  the  submission  made  in  support  of  the appeal. On the  1s t  -   3r d   grounds  of appeal,  he  argued  in  reply that the payments made to the two foreign companies constituted royalty because the payments were for the right to use an intellectual property, that is; the

computer software  which  is  a  scientific  work,  the  title  and  ownership  of which remained with the owners in terms of clause 8.2 of the Agreement.

The  learned  counsel  contended  further that the  payments  made to the  two  off-shore  companies  was  an  income  derived  from  the  United Republic of Tanzania and therefore, under S. 3 (1) (b), 3 (2) (a) (iii) of the ITA  1973  and  S.  6  (1)  of ITA  2004,  were  subject to withholding tax.  He also cited Sections 6 and  10 (c) of the ITA 1973 and S.  82 (1) of the ITA 2004  in  support  of  his  argument  that  payments  derived  from inter alia , royalty are gains or profits that are subject to taxation.  On  that basis,  he argued, the appellant had the obligation to withhold the payable tax failure of which it became liable to pay such tax under S. 34 (5) (a) and (b) of the ITA 1973 and S. 84 (3) and (4) of the ITA 2004.

The  learned  counsel  went  on  to  argue  that  the  Tribunal  correctly found that the  payments constituted  royalty  by virtue of interpretation of that term under S. 3 of the ITA 2004. Making reference to clause 8.2 of the Agreement,  he  submitted  that  the  payments  were  in  effect  based  on  a lease  of  a   computer  software,  an  intangible  asset  to  which  the  owners, who retained the right of ownership, received as consideration for the use of the computer software.

The respondent's counsel argued also that the Tribunal's finding that the payments were subject to withholding tax on  royalty in terms of S.  2 (1)  (d)  of the  ITA  1973  was  correct.  He  contended  that the finding  was based on the definition of the term royalty which, he said, is not limited to payments  made  as  consideration  for  tangible  assets  but  also  for  gains derived from a sale or exchange of a right or property. He stated as follows at page 4 of his written submission

"... this  section [S.  2  (1)  (d)  of the ITA  1973] is not li mited to tangible things but broadly extends to include 'gains'  derived from the sale or exchange of  any right or property.  There was an exchange of  rights between the appellant  and  the  foreign companies  in which the appellant  acquired  the  right  to use  software. The payment was gains derived from an exchange of right for the use of  the software hence was subject to income tax in terms of sections 3 (1) (b), 3 (2) (a) (Hi) of the Income Tax Act, 1973 read with sections 6 and 10 (f) of the Income Tax  Act, 1973."

On  the  use  of  the  OECD  Commentary  in  determining  the  issue whether or  not the  payments constituted  royalty,  Mr.  Tito submitted that the  Tribunal  cannot  be  faulted  for  having  declined  to  do  so  because  as observed  in  the  impugned  decision,  the  definition  of  the  term  royalty

appearing  in  both  ITA  1973  and  2004  clearly  covers  the  nature  of the payments made by the appellant to the two foreign companies.

The  learned  counsel  argued  further  in  reply  that,  in  any  case,  the transaction  giving  rise  to  this  appeal  was  not  based  on  any  existing  tax treaty between our country and countries of the two off-shore companies for adoption of the OECD Commentary. To bolster his argument,  Mr. Tito cited S. 7 (1) (2) of the Tax Administration Act, 2015. On the case of Infra Soft  Limited (supra),  the  learned  counsel  reiterated  the  argument  he made before the Tribunal, that the decision in that case was based on the interpretation  of  the  provisions  of  the  Indian  legislation  which  have  no relevant similarity with the provisions of our tax legislation.

Citing  the  cases  of Tullow Tanzania  BV and Bulyanhulu  Gold Mine  Limited (supra),  the  learned  counsel  stressed  that  the  Tribunal adopted a correct interpretation of the provisions of S. 2 (1) (a) and (d) of the  ITA  1973  and  S.  3   (a)  of the ITA  2004 thereby  arriving  at  a   correct decision that the payments constituted  royalty.  He also relied on the case of BP Tanzania (supra)  to  emphasize  his argument that a  payment for consultancy services which  is in the form of an  intangible thing  constitute

royalty when such payment having its source within the United Republic of Tanzania, is paid to an off-shore company.

From  the  rival  submissions  made  by the  learned  advocates  for the parties,  we  agree  with  Dr.  Nguluma's  proposition  that  the  grounds  of appeal raise the following issues.

- 1. Whether  the  Tribunal  erred in  fact  and/or  law  by ignoring  to  determine  an  issue  brought  before  it namely; the  relevance  of  the  authorities  placed before it which if  considered the Tribunal would have decided the matter  in favour of  the  Appellant;
- 2.  Alternatively-f   whether the  Tribunal erred in law and fact in  holding that the computer software in issue purchased from two foreign companies are intangible intellectual  property which is protected  through patent  arrangement;
- 3.  Whether the Tribunal erred in law by holding that the mere right to use software program constituted use of  copyright, giving rise to royalty; and
- 4.  Whether the Tribunal erred in fact and law by holding that payment made  for the purchase  of computer software licence were subject to withholding Tax on Royalty  in terms of  section 2(1) (a).

We need not be detained much in determining the first issue. Having read  the  impugned judgment,  we find  with  respect that the Tribunal  did not  ignore  to  determine  the  relevance  of the  OECD  Commentary to  the case  and  the  need  to  consider  the  case  law  from  other jurisdictions.  It indeed  considered  the  application  of the  said  commentary  and  the  cited decisions.  It was of the opinion that the interpretation of the term  royalty under  our  law  sufficiently  covered  the  character  of  the  payments  in question  and  therefore, the  Commentary  and  foreign  decisions  were inapplicable.

Since there was no dispute that the OECD Commentary had  not, at the  material  time  been  domesticated,  it  is  trite  principle  that  the  same could be  applied  as  an  aid  to  interpretation  only  when  there  is  an ambiguity or gap in the definition of the term royalty as provided under our law.  -See  for  example  the  case  of Bank of Kenya  Limited  v.  Kenya Revenue Authority [2009]  e  KLR  (per.  Nyamu,  J.A.).  In  that case,  the Court of Appeal of Kenya observed as follows on that principle:-

"...unless an international instrument has been domesticated, the local courts would apply it only where there is ambiguity or  a gap in the domestic law ..."

On  the  basis of the  above  stated  principle,  the Tribunal  could  only apply  the  OECD  Commentary  if  it  found  that  the  definition  of  the  term royalty is ambiguous or when there is a gap in that definition such that it does  not cover the  character  of the  payments  in  question.  The  Tribunal found however, that there was no such ambiguity or a gap. It observed as follows in its judgment at pages 259 -260 of the record.

"It  is  my  view  that,  under  this ground  the  Appellant correctly defined the term royalty as  provided for by  ITA 1973 and ITA 2004. It is also not proper to took at the definition of  the term ' royalty'  in other jurisdiction as our ITA provides a dear definition under Sec. 2(1) (a) (b) (c) and (d).... In addition to that, it is our collective opinion that Sec.  3 of ITA 2004provides better definition of  royalty ...."

[Emphasis added].

Now therefore, whether or not the Tribunal was right in the above stated findings is a question which, in our  view, can be answered  when considering the 3r d  and 4t h  issues.

The 2n d   issue  can  also  be  disposed  of  briefly. As submitted  by  Dr. Nguluma the issue whether or not a property is patented is a matter which

can only be established by evidence.  In its decision, the Tribunal held that the relevant computer software is intangible intellectual  property which  is protected through patent arrangements such that only the owner can allow or permit someone else to access and  use it at a fee without transferring ownership. The Tribunal  did  not however  refer to any evidence showing that there  is such  patent arrangements. The term "patent" is defined  in Black's Law Dictionary, 9t h  Edn; as follows:-

## "The Government  grant of  a right, privilege, or authority . "

In order  to  treat  the  computer  software  which was  licenced  to  the appellant  as  a  patented  property  therefore,  existence  of  a  grant  to that effect must be established.  That was not done in this case.

As shown above however, the decision of the Tribunal was not solely based on the finding that the software was a patented material, the use of which had'  constituted royalty under S. 2 (1) (c) of ITA 1973 and S. 3 (a) of ITA  2004.  The  decision  was  also  based  on  the  finding  that  payments constituted  royalty for use of copyright under S .  2(1)  (a) of the ITA  1973 and S.3 (a) of the ITA 2004, not only for the use of a patent under S. 3 (a)

of the  ITA  2004. It  is  that  finding  which  has  given  rise  the  3r d   and  4t h issues which we now proceed to consider.

In determining the last two issues stated above, we find it instructive, as a starting point, to reproduce the relevant parts of S. 2 of the ITA 1973 and S.  3 of the ITA 2004 which define the term  royalty.  Under S.  2(1) of the ITA 1973 the term "royalty" is defined as follows:-

- ' 'royalty'  means:-......
- (a) any copyright of  literary, artistic or  scientific work; or
- (b) any cinematograph film , including film or tape for radio or  television broadcasting; or
- (c) any  patent, trade mark, design or  model\ plan , formula or  process; or
- (d) any industrial, commercial  or  scientific equipment; or for  information concerning industrial, commercial or  scientific equipment or  experience, and includes  gains derived  from the sale or exchange of  any right  or  property  giving rise to such royalty."

In the subsequent Act, the ITA 2004, the term is defined as follows:

## " 'royalty'  means:-

- (a) the use of,  or the right to use,   a copyright, patent, design,  model,  plan,  secret  formula  or process  or trademark;
- (b) the supply of  know-how  including information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific equipment or experience;
- (c) the use of,  or right to use,  a cinematography film, videotape, sound recording or any other like medium;
- (d) the use of,  or right to use,  industrial,  commercial or scientific equipment;
- (e) the supply of  assistance ancillary to a matter referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d); or
- (f) a total or  partial  forbearance with respect to a matter referred to in paragraphs (a) to (e),

but excludes a natural  resource  payment  "

As stated  above,  the Tribunal  held that the  payments  made for the use of the computer software constituted  royalty under both  provisions of the ITA 1973 [S. 2 (1) (a) and (d)] and the ITA 2004 [S.3 (a) and (d)]. In its judgment at page 262 of the record of appeal, the Tribunal  had this to say:-

"... we concur with the Appellant counsel that software was intellectual property much  like  artistic,  literary  or scientific work  referred to under the entire section of  ITA Cap.  33  1973,  and  that  consideration  for  use  of the software  whether for private  or commercial purposes, therefore amounts to royalty within the meaning of  S . 2 of  the ITA 1973."

Although from the passage quoted above, in concluding its judgment, the Tribunal relied generally on S . 2 of the ITA 1973, the parties are not in dispute that in characterizing the payments as  royalty, the Tribunal  relied specifically on the provisions of S. 2(1) (a) and (d) of the ITA 1973 and S . 3 (a)  and  (d)  of  the  ITA  2004. The  controversy  is  that,  whereas the learned counsel  for  the  appellant  has  strongly  argued  that  the  Tribunal erred  in  applying  the  above  stated  provisions,  the  respondent's  counsel has, with equal force, supported the finding of the Tribunal.

In  support  of  his  submission,  apart  from relying  on  the  OECD Cometary  which  as  observed  above  was  considered  by  the Tribunal  but found to be inapplicable, Dr. Nguluma relied also on the case of Infra Soft Limited (supra).  We  agree  with  the  learned  counsel  that,  the  case  is relevant  to  the  point  at  issue  as  a  persuasive  decision  and  the Tribunal

should  have  considered  it  in  determining  whether  or  not  the  payments constituted  royalty  by  virtue  of  interpretation  of  that  term  under  the provisions of the ITA 1973 and ITA 2004. We will therefore consider it in this appeal to determine whether or not in the present case, the Tribunal erred in finding that the payments constituted royalty.

In  the  said  case,  which  was  decided  by  the  Bench  of  the  Delhi Income Tax Appeals Tribunal, the Tribunal considered whether or not the payments received  under licence agreement allowing the use of software, was in the nature of royalty income or constituted the business profit of the assessee. In  its decision, the tribunal  relied on the definition of royalty in Explanation 2 of S. 9(1) (it) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 and Article 13(6) of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between Indian and the USA, the country from where the software was supplied.  Explanation 2 of S. 9(1) (vi) of that Act defines royalty to mean inter  aiia:-

"consideration  for  the  transfer  of  aii  or  any  rights (including the  grant  of  licence)  in respect  of  any copyright,  literary,  artistic  or  scientific  work  including films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in connection  with radio broadcasting, but not including consideration for the sale,  distribution or exhibition of  cinematographic films . . . "

Upon that consideration, the Tribunal held that, although the Revenue Authority treated the  payments as royalty contending that there was transfer of some right including the granting of a licence in respect of the copyright,  the  payment was  not royalty  under either the Income Tax Act  or  under  the  DTAA. It  held  instead,  that  the  payment  was  in  the nature of business profit chargeable to tax.

On appeal to the High Court of Delhi in ITA 1034/2009, the decision of the Tribunal was upheld. In its decision, the  High Court observed inter a//athat, there in a distinction between the acquisition of a copyright and a copyrighted  material. It  held  that when  what is acquired  is the  use of a copyrighted  article,  then  the  payment  does  not  constitute  royalty. The relevant passage states as follows:-

" Distinction has to be made between the acquisition of  a ' copyright'  and  a ' copyrighted  article'. Copyright  is distinct from the material object, copyrighted copyright  is an intangible incorporeal of a privilege, quite independent  of  any  material  substance, such  as  a manuscript Just  because  one  has  the  copyrighted article, it does not follow that one has also the copyright in it It does not amount to transfer of  all or any right including license in respect of copyright Copyright or

even right to use copyright is distinguishable from sale consideration  paid  to copyrighted  article. This  sale consideration is for  purpose of  goods and  is not  royalty."

That court went on to state that:

"The payment  is for a copyrighted  article and represents the purchase price of  an article and cannot be considered as royalty either under the Income Tax Act or under the DTAA."

That decision of the  High  Court of Delhi  is  however,  in  conflict with another decision of the High Court of Karnataka in the Case of Commissioner of Income Tax  &amp; another v.  Sumsung  Electronics Co.  Ltd  &amp; others (accessed  through  www.taxpundit.org). In that case which  involved  a  number  of  consolidated  appeals  on  the  same  subject matter, the definition  of the term 'royalty' under Explanation  2 of S.  9(1) (vi)  of the  Indian  Income  Tax  Act,  1971  and  the  provision  of the  DTAA between India and USA, France and Sweden, the countries from where the involved computer  software were imported, that court observed as follows:-

" In view of  the above said  definition of  royalty, it is dear that the necessary ingredient to be satisfied to find out as to whether the payment would  amount to royalty  is as

follows; payment of any kind received as consideration for the use of,  or the right to  use,  any copy right of li t erary, artistic or  scientific work. It  has  been universally accepted that a literary work is entitled to a copyright and wherefore, a literary work is entitled to be registered as copyright. In India,  the provisions of  S .   2 of  the  Copyright  Act  1957  defines  literary  work  as under:-

'Literary  work'  includes  computer  programs, table and  compilations including computer (databases). Therefore, ' c omputer software' has been recognized as copyright work in India also."

Having  also  considered  that,  like  in  present  case,  from  the  parties7 agreement the licence was only for the use of the computer software while the  copyright continued  to  remain  with  the  non-residents,  the  said  court held as follows:

"...on reading the contents of  the respective agreements entered into by the respondents with the non-resident, it is dear that under the agreement,  what was transferred is only a licence to use the copyright belonging to the non-resident subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement as referred to  above  and the  non-resident

supplier continues to be the owner of the copyright and ail other intellectual property rights. It is  well settled that copyright is a negative right It is an umbrella of many rights and licence is granted for making use of  the copyright in respect of shrink wrapped software/off-the shelf software under the respective agreements,  which authorize the end user i.e the customer to make use of the copyright software  contained in  the said software, which is purchased off-the-shelf or imported as shrink wrapped  software  and  the  same  would  amount  to transfer of  part of  the copyright and transfer of  right to use the copyright for internal  business and  per the terms and conditions of  the agreement. Therefore, the contention by the learned Senior counsel appearing for the respondents that there is no transfer of  copyright or any part thereof under the agreements entered into by the respondent with the non-resident supplier of software cannot  be accepted."

As  stated  above,  the  Indian  case  cited  by  the  appellant's  counsel  is  in conflict  with  the  earlier  case  of Samsung  Electronics  Co.  Ltd (supra) which the High Court of Delhi declined to follow.

In the East African jurisdiction,  it has been  held, in the Kenyan case of Kenya  Commercial  Bank  Limited  v.  Kenya  Revenue  Authority

[2016]  eKLR,  that  a  payment  for the  right to  use  a  computer  software constitutes royalty. Like in the present case,  upon  payment for a  licence, the  appellant  bank  was  provided  with  computer  software  by  a  foreign company for use in  banking  services. The issue was whether or not the payment was in the nature of royalty. The decision was arrived at by the Court of Appeal of Kenya after having considered the definition of the term royalty  under  S.  2   of the  Kenya  Income  Tax  Act  which  is  similar  to  the same section of our ITA 1973.

The  court  answered  the  issue  in  the  affirmative  as follows:-

"...the agreement between the parties was for  grant of  a li cence to the bank to use Infosys computer software program and  for  provision  of  other  services. The agreement specifically provided, inter alia that Infosys would at all times retain  all title,  copyright and other proprietary rights in software and that the bank would not acquire any rights other than those specified in the agreement...  It is plain  from  the  agreement  that  the payment of  licence fees was a consideration or the right to use  Infosys  intellectual  property  in the  form  of computer software program which is within the definition of  royalty under clause (c) of  S . 2 o f  the  Act . "

We have considered the approaches taken by the courts in the three cases cited  above  regarding the  issue whether or  not payments  made to foreign companies for licence to  use computer software constitute royalty as defined in the laws of the courts' respective jurisdictions. The decisions in the  cases  of Kenya  Commercial  Bank  Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd (supra) support the position taken by the Tribunal in the impugned decision.

In our considered view the decision of the Court of Appeal of Kenya, which  is from the  East African Jurisdiction and which was arrived at after the  court  had  considered  the  interpretation  of  the  term  royalty  in  the provision  which  is  almost  in pari materia to  the  provisions  our  Income Tax Laws (the ITA  1973 and  2004)  is  highly  persuasive.  We subscribe to the interpretation  made to the effect that the payments made in that case constituted royalty.

In the case at hand, the payments made to Ericsson AB and Alcatel France were consideration by the appellant for making use of the computer software subject to the terms and conditions stipulated  under clauses 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 of the Agreement.  By such  grant,  the two foreign  companies

made  limited  or  a  partial  transfer  of  their  copyright  to  be  used  by  the appellant  in  its  telecommunication  services.  For  these  reasons,  we  hold that,  although  in its decision, the Tribunal extended its characterization of the  payments to  cover the other  paragraphs  of sections  2(1)  of the  ITA 1973 and S.  3 of ITA 2004 respectively as shown above,  it did  not err in deciding  that  the  payments  constituted  royalty  because  it  also  precisely based  its  interpretation  on  the  relevant  paragraph  (a)  of those  sections. The 3r d  and 4t h  issues are therefore, answered in the negative.

In the event, we are satisfied that the appeal is devoid of merit. As a result, we hereby dismiss it with costs.

DATED at DAR ES SALAAM this 25t h  day of April, 2019.
