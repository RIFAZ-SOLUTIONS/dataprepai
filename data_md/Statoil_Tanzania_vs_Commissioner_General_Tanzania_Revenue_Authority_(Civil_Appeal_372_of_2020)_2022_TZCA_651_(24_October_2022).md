## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

2&amp;h September &amp; 24h  October, 2022

## KIHWELO. J.A.:

This  is  an  appeal  by  Statoil  Tanzania  AS  (currently  known  as Equinor Tanzania AS), the appellant, against the judgment and decree of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated the 21st April, 2021  in Tax Appeal  No.  27  of 2020  which  quashed  and  reversed  the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) that found the Commissioner  General,  the  respondent  was  not justified  in  imposing stamp  duty  on  the  Farm-Out  Agreement  between  the  appellant  and ExxonMobil which was executed outside Mainland Tanzania. Aggrieved

by the impugned decision the appellant has come before this Court by way of appeal.

We find  it crucial,  at the outset, to  preface the judgment with a brief historical background which appropriately describes what precipitated  this  appeal.  The  appellant  is  a  limited  liability  company incorporated  under the  laws  of Tanzania  and  its  principal  business  is exploration of oil and gas in Tanzania since 2007. One of the areas where the  appellant  was  operating  was  Block  2,  situated  within  Tanzania's Exclusive Economic Zone.

The epicenter of this appeal is  the demand notice for stamp duty issued by the respondent to the appellant, following a comprehensive tax audit exercise which the respondent conducted on 19th  August, 2013 into the tax affairs of the appellant,  covering  stamp duty,  withholding tax, Value Added Tax (VAT) and Pay as You Earn for the year of income 2011 and came to the conclusions that, there was a tax liability to the tune of TZS.  170, 414, 448.00 arising from the Farm-Out transaction on Block 2 between the appellant and ExxonMobil  in which the appellant assigned its  petroleum  rights  under the  Production  Sharing Agreement (PSA) to ExxonMobil  Exploration  and  Production Tanzania  Limited  (ExxonMobil). Apparently, on 18th  April, 2007, the appellant had signed a PSA with the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania and Tanzania Petroleum

Development Corporation (TPDC) in respect of Block 2 offshore Tanzania Mainland. The appellant claimed that, according to Article 27 (e) of the PSA, the appellant is excepted  from any  liability connected with assignment and operations of the sites.

The  appellant,  unamused  with  the  demand  notice,  lodged  an objection  before the  respondent contesting  it.  However,  the  objection was  not  successful. Meanwhile,  during  the  objection process, the respondent, orally informed the appellant that, the disputed amount had already been deducted from the appellant's VAT refunds which were due.

Aggrieved by the respondent's decision, the appellant knocked the door of the Board challenging it.  Upon full determination, the  Board in its decision found in favour of the appellant as hinted before, something which triggered the respondent to lodge the appeal before the Tribunal seeking to reverse the decision of the Board. Upon hearing the parties, the Tribunal allowed the appeal in its entirety and quashed the decision of the Tribunal something which  precipitated the instant appeal  before the Court.

The  appellant  presently  seeks  to  impugn  the  decision  of  the Tribunal upon a Memorandum of Appeal which goes thus;

- 1.  That the Honourable Tribunal erred in law by  holding that the appellant failed to discharge his burden o f

proof  that he was exempted from payment o f  stamp duty as required  by the law.

- 2.  That the Honourable Tribunal erred  in law by  holding that,  under Article 27 (e) o f the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA),  the Government o f Tanzania was not duty bound to take a ll reasonable steps to give legal effect o f  the agreed  stamp duty exemption.
- 3.  That the Honourable Tribunal erred  in law by  holding that the Farm-Out  Agreement between the appellant and ExxonMobil executed outside Mainland Tanzania is chargeable to stamp  duty  immediately  upon execution.
- 4.  That the Honourable Tribunal erred in law by  holding that the respondent's issuance o f Notice o f Confirmation  o f Assessment  without  issuing  the objection determination letter as required  by the law did  not  prejudice the appellant.

When, eventually, the matter was placed before us for hearing on 26th  September, 2022 the appellant had the services of Dr. Fayaz Bhojan who  teamed  up  with  Dr.  Abel  Mwiburi  and  Ms.  Anitha  Kimario  both learned counsel whereas Mr. Amandus Ndayeza who was assisted by Mr. Yohana  Ndila  and  Nyamtungila  Mgune,  both  learned  State  Attorneys stood for the respondent. Both the learned counsel for the appellant and the respondent lodged written submissions in compliance with rule  106

(1) and sub-rule (8) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules, 2009, either in support or in opposition to the appeal which they,  respectively, fully adopted during the hearing. In the upshot, Dr. Mwiburi invited us to allow the  appeal  with  costs,  whereas  Mr.  Ndayeza  urged  us  to  dismiss  the appeal with costs.

Dr.  Mwiburi  prefaced his submission  by praying and was granted leave to argue ground one,  two and three conjointly as they relate to each other while ground four was argued separately. In arguing the first three grounds, the learned counsel contended that, the Tribunal erred in law in holding that the respondent was justified in imposing stamp duty on  the  Farm-Out  Agreement  between  the  appellant  and  ExxonMobil executed outside Mainland Tanzania.

The  appellant's  counsel  submitted  further  that,  the  appellant entered into a tripartite PSA with the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania  and  Tanzania  Petroleum  Development  Corporation  dated 18th   April,  2007  for  Block  2  offshore  and  according  to  the  appellant's counsel, the terms of the PSA constitute a commitment which is binding on the respondent.  He cited article 27 (e) of the PSA which exempted the  appellant  from  any  tax  liability  connected  to  the  assignment  and operations of the sites. According to the appellant's counsel, it was on the basis of this explicit stamp duty exemption under article 27 (e) which

has never been varied by the Government, that the appellant relied upon in respect of the assignment of part of interest in Block 2 to ExxonMobil. The learned counsel contended that, any attempt to levy the stamp duty on the appellant amounts to breach of the PSA and requested the Court not to turn a blind eye to it.

In further submission, the learned counsel for the appellant argued that section  143 of the Income Tax Act,  Cap 332  R.E.  2019  (the ITA) requires persons with binding agreements with the Government to apply to  the  Minister  responsible  for  Finance  for  an  inclusion  of  the  said agreements in the  Register of Tax Agreements and that the appellant attempted to register the PSA with the Minister responsible for Finance as required by section 143 of the ITA and that the appellant had  already availed  a  copy of the  PSA to the  Minister  hence  it was wrong  for the Tribunal to conclude that the appellant failed to discharge her burden of proof  that the PSA was executed, he argued. It was the learned counsel's view that, the absence of the Government Notice neither nullifies the PSA nor makes the provisions on exemption from stamp duty, a nullity and therefore, the appellant discharged the burden of proof under section 18 (2) (b) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act, Cap. 408 R.E. 2019 (TRAA).

Advancing further his support for the appeal, the learned counsel contended that, stamp duty is charged under the Stamp Duty Act, Cap

189 R.E. 20019 (the Act) and more specifically, he referred to section 5 which gives a  rundown of instruments specified in the Schedule to the Act and  which  are chargeable with  stamp duty and  submitted  that,  if none of the conditions stipulated under section 5(1) (a) and (b) exists, then  stamp  duty  does  not  arise.  In  further  illustration,  the  learned counsel  submitted  that,  stamp  duty  is  levied  on  instruments  and  not transactions and therefore, according to him since the Farm-Out Agreement between the appellant and ExxonMobil was executed outside Mainland  Tanzania,  section  26  of the  Act,  requires  that  it  has  to  be stamped within thirty (30) days of its arrival  in  Mainland Tanzania and since  the  Farm-Out Agreement  has  not arrived  in  Mainland  Tanzania, then section 26 of the Act does not have effect until such time that the Farm-Out Agreement arrives in Mainland Tanzania, Dr. Mwiburi, argued. Stressing, he contended that tax is payable only where there is a law to that effect and that, it is payable when it is due and not otherwise. He paid homage to the case of Bidco Oil and Soap Ltd v. Commissioner General Tanzania  Revenue Authority, Civil  Appeal  No.  89 of 2009 (unreported) in order to facilitate an appreciation of his proposition put forward  and  rounded  off with  the  argument that the  intention  of the legislature under section 26 of the Act was to ensure that documents are physically present in Tanzania. In this regard, the learned counsel argued

that, tax statutes have to be strictly interpreted while citing the foreign decision in Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC [1921] 1 KB 64.

Dr. Mwiburi, insistently, prayed that the Court should hold that the Farm-Out Agreement between the appellant and  ExxonMobil executed outside Mainland Tanzania was not chargeable to stamp duty immediately upon execution.

Arguing in the alternative, the learned counsel submitted that, even if  we  assume that the  alleged  tax  was  payable  in  the  instant  matter before us, which is disputed by the appellant, according to section 41(d) of the Act, ExxonMobil a grantee in this case was the one liable to pay tax and not the appellant since there is no evidence on record that the appellant agreed to pay the duty instead of the grantee, ExxonMobil. The learned counsel implored us to order the respondent refund the appellant the amount of  TZS. 170,414,448.00 which according to him, was wrongly collected through setting off from the appellant's VAT refunds.

The  learned  counsel  for the  appellant,  finally,  argued  the  fourth ground  of  appeal  whose  complaint  was  based  on  the  fact  that,  the respondent  issued  notice  of  confirmation  of  assessment  without  first issuing the  objection determination letter as required by  the  law something which  the appellant's counsel  argued  that it prejudiced  the appellant. Arguing further, the learned counsel contended that,

according to the TRAA which was applicable by then, it is a requirement that the respondent must determine or refuse to determine the objection first and proceed to issue a letter of determination before issuing a notice of confirmation of assessment and cited the repealed section  13 (3) of the TRAA which was applicable by then, now section 52 (3) (a) and (b) of the Tax Administration Act,  Cap.  438  R.E.  2019  (TAA). The  learned counsel,  faulted  the  Tribunal  for  not  finding  that  the  appellant  was prejudiced by the respondent's conduct of issuing notice of confirmation of  assessment  without  first  issuing  the  objection  determination  in compliance with the law.

Upon  our  prompting,  the  appellant  contended  that,  failure  to receive the letter of determination deprived the appellant's right to know the detailed reasons for refusal and therefore prepare reasoned grounds of appeal  to the  Board,  and  that,  failure  to  receive  the  said  letter  of determination  prejudiced the appellant who was not properly informed on the respondent's reasons for refusal to amend the assessment. In the circumstances, the learned counsel beseeched us to nullify the respondent's notice of confirmation  of assessment which  according to him,  was  issued  contrary to  prescribed  procedures  under the  law.  He finally, urged that the appeal be allowed.

In response, Mr. Ndayeza, learned State Attorney strongly disagreed with the counsel for the appellant and argued in response to the appeal in a pattern adopted by the appellant. Essentially, he opposed the appeal by contending that, the appellant did not manage to discharge the burden of proof that it was exempted from paying stamp duty on the Farm-Out Agreement, because at all material times, the appellant did not produce  a  Government  Notice  issued  by  the  Minister  as  required  by section  16  (1)  of the  Act.  He  went on  to  submit that,  from  the  clear wording of section 16 (1) above, stamp duty exemption is not automatic but rather, it is granted  by an  instrument issued by the Minister under section 16 (1) referred to above.

In further opposing the appeal, the learned State Attorney, argued that,  the  entire  claim  for  exemption  was  solely  based  upon  the  PSA between  the  appellant  and  the  Government  as  well  as  the  Farm-Out Agreement executed outside Mainland Tanzania. However, the appellant failed  also  to  produce  the  said  PSA to  support  its  case.  Referring  to section  18 (2) of the TRAA, the learned State Attorney contended that, the appellant failed to prove its case and therefore, the Tribunal was not erroneous in reversing the decision of the Board.

Arguing further in opposing the appeal the learned State Attorney submitted  that,  the  decision  to  charge  stamp  duty  on  the  appellant's

Farm-Out Agreement with  ExxonMobil is supported by the  provision of section  5  (1)  (b)  of  the  Act,  which  makes  it  mandatory  for  every instrument executed  outside  Mainland  Tanzania  to  be  charged  stamp duty  provided  that  the  instrument  relates  to  a  property  situated  in Mainland  Tanzania.  Illustrating  further,  the  learned  State  Attorney, contended that, reading between lines, the combined words of section 5 (1)  (b) and  section  16 of the Act, the Tribunal  was perfectly correct in holding that there was no proof of exemption so granted by the Minister.

Attacking article 27 (e) of the PSA which was repeatedly cited by Dr.  Mwiburi,  the  learned  State  Attorney  argued  that  normally  tax  is imposed  by the  law and equally, tax exemption  is granted  by the  law which imposed tax in the first place. He argued further that, a PSA itself even if it was admitted  in  evidence cannot warrant tax exemption.  He referred us to the case of Cape Brabdy Syndicate v. Inland Revenue Commissioner (1921) 2 KB 403 to support his proposition.

In reply to the fourth ground of appeal, the learned State Attorney submitted that, the complaint by the appellant was a mere afterthought since the impugned decision was determined mainly based on substantive  issues  having  the  appellant  conceded  that  the  notice  of confirmation  is as good as final determination.  He referred  us to page 233 of the record of appeal to buttress his point. Elaborating further, the

learned State Attorney argued that, the respondent's decision to confirm the assessment was justified in law and the circumstances of the case as there  was  no valid  objection  before the  respondent  because essential documents  for  verification  on  whether  the  appellant  was  entitled  to exemption  or  not  were  not  submitted.  He  further  argued  that,  the appellant  was  not  prejudiced  because  upon  receipt  of  the  notice  of confirmation  of assessment  was  able  to  lodge  the  appeal  before  the Board. He rounded off by submitting that the Tribunal was correct in law i to  hold  that  by  issuing  final  assessment  by  necessary  implications the respondent  disagreed  with  the  objection  and  urged  further  that  this appeal be dismissed.

In a brief  rejoinder, Dr. Bhojan  reiterated  what  was  earlier submitted  by  Dr.  Mwiburi,  that the  respondent did  not follow the  laid down  procedures  in  tax  dispute  resolution  which  are  clearly  spelt out under the law and which requires that there has to be a proposal to settle first,  followed  by  determination  of the  objection  and  finally  notice  of confirmation of payment.  He finally submitted that, the burden of proof was not fair on the part of the appellant, urging further the appeal to be allowed.

After  a  careful  consideration  of  the  entire  record  and  the  rival submissions  by the  parties there  remains only one contentious aspect

that  needs  to  be  resolved  and  that  is  whether  or  not  the  Tribunal erroneously  decided  the  appeal  before  it  and  therefore  came  to  the wrong conclusion warranting this Court to interfere.

Starting with the first limb of the three grounds of grievance, which were ably argued by the learned trained minds conjointly, we think in  an  attempt  to  answer  them,  we  should  start  by  reflection  of the provision of section 5 (1) (b) of the Act, which reads:

"5-(l) Every instrument specified in the Schedule to this Act and which-

- (a) N/A
- (b) if   executed outside Mainland Tanzania, relates to any  property  in  Mainland  Tanzania  or  to  any matter  or  thing  to  be  performed  or  done  in Mainland Tanzania, shall be chargeable with duty of  the  amount  specified  or  calculated  in  the manner specified in  that Schedule in relation  to such instrum ent"

Clearly,  the  excerpt  above  is  unambiguous that,  any  instrument executed  outside  Mainland  Tanzania  in  relation  to  any  property  in Mainland Tanzania  is chargeable with  stamp duty.  It is  momentous to observe that parties are not at issue on whether there was a Farm-Out Agreement executed outside  Mainland Tanzania  which  the  respondent subjected it to stamp duty. The gravamen of this appeal in the first limb

of the three grounds of complaint seems to lie on the issue whether the appellant  was  liable  to  pay  stamp  duty  for  the  Farm-Out  Agreement executed outside Mainland Tanzania and whether the liability if at all for payment of stamp duty was due. The appellant argues that since the Farm-Out Agreement was executed outside Mainland Tanzania, section 26 of the Act, requires that it has to be stamped within thirty (30) days of its  arrival  in  Mainland  Tanzania  and  since the  Farm-Out Agreement has not arrived in Mainland Tanzania, then section 26 of the Act does not have  effect  until  such  time  that  the  Farm-Out  Agreement  arrives  in Mainland Tanzania. On the other hand, the respondent argues that, the appellant did  not discharge the  burden  of proof that it was exempted from  paying  stamp  duty  because  the  appellant  did  not  produce  a Government Notice issued by the Minister as required by section 16 (1) of the Act.

It is convenient at this stage to excerpt section 16 (1) of the Act so far as it governs exemption of stamp duty:

"16-(1) The Minister may, by notice in the Gazette, exempt  any chargeable instrument, or  any category, class or description o f  such  instruments, from stamp duty."

Clearly,  the  wording  of the  above  provision  is  explicit  that  the Minister has discretion to exempt any chargeable instrument from stamp

duty.  However,  the  most discernible  part of that  provision  is that the Minister  has  to  do  so  by  a  notice  published  in  the  Gazette  and  not otherwise. As rightly argued  by the learned  State Attorney, exemption being part of the tax regime has to be governed by law and section  16 (1) of the Act is the most relevant when it comes to exemption on stamp duty. Put simply, there has to be a law which is permissive and prescribed procedures for one to be exempted and not automatically, as the learned counsel for the appellant sought to convince us believe so, which we are unable to heed.

Quite unfortunate, and for an obscure cause, the appellant did not produce the alleged PSA in evidence nor did it produce the Government Notice issued by the Minister giving the appellant exemption from paying stamp duty which is legally chargeable under section 5 of the Act.

Trying as hard as we can, to follow Dr. Mwiburi's reasoning, we fail to  understand  how  could  the  respondent  exempt  the  appellant  from paying  stamp duty in the  absence of proof of the Government  Notice issued by the Minister giving the appellant exemption from paying stamp duty.

Truly, section 26  of  the  Act  which governs  stamping of  a chargeable instrument executed out of Mainland Tanzania provides:

"Every  chargeable instrument  executed  out  o f Mainland Tanzania shall be stamped within thirty days of  its first  arrival  in M ainland Tanzania. '

Unquestionably, the appellant has not registered the alleged FarmOut  Agreement  executed  outside  Mainland  Tanzania  as  required  by section  143 of the ITA to date. As it can be conspicuously seen, neither the PSA  nor  the  Farm-Out  Agreement  are  part  of  the  record  of proceedings to date which further complicates the appellants reliance on exemption claim.

In  these  circumstances,  we  are  decidedly  of the  view  that,  the appellant did not discharge its burden of proof as required under section 18 (2) (b) of the TRAA. For, the better understanding of section 18 (2) (b)  of  the  TRAA,  we  think,  it  is  desirable  to  reproduce  the  relevant provision. It reads:

"18-(2y ) In  every proceeding before  the  Board and before the Tribunal-

- (a) N/A
- (b) the onus o f  proving that the assessment or decision in respect o f which an appeal is preferred is excessive or erroneous shall be on the appellant."

In the totality of  the above, there can be no better words to express our view and conclude as we do that, the appellant's case was weak to

discharge  its  burden  of proof that  it complied  with  the tax exemption regime as required by the law.  It could  not ride on the weaknesses of the  respondent which  in our view is not the case in the instant appeal before us. We are satisfied, as the Tribunal did, that the appellant had no  strong  case.  Consequently,  we find  that,  the Tribunal  was  right in reversing  the  Board's decision.  To  conclude the first three grounds of appeal must fail.

We will next move to the second limb of the appeal which covered the fourth ground on the complaint that the appellant was prejudiced by the respondent issuing notice of confirmation of assessment without first issuing  the  objection  determination  letter.  In  his  view,  the  learned counsel  for  the  appellant  argued  that,  failure  to  receive  the  letter  of determination deprived the appellant's right to know detailed reasons for refusal  and  therefore  prepare  properly their  grounds of appeal  to the Board.

We should interpose here and observe that, the above submission by the appellant  is largely in  stark contrast to  what transpired  on  the ground.  Record of the proceedings at page  136 bear out that,  on  17th December,  2013  the  respondent  required  the  appellant  to  submit documents  proving  existence  and registration of  the PSA  for  the respondent's verification  and  record  as  required  by section  143  of the

ITA but quite unfortunate the appellant did not heed and in the contrary the appellant wrote a letter at page 173 of the record of proceedings in which,  instead of submitting the  PSA the appellant spent considerable amount of time explaining about the history behind the existence of the appellant's company, the PSA and the gas discoveries made off the coast of Tanzania. Even in the appellant's letter to the Minister responsible for finance,  the  appellant did  not avail the  PSA  but rather expressed  that they were ready to avail a copy of the PSA should the Minister require it. This is evident at page 176 of the record of proceedings.

We hasten to state that, the appellant's argument as the learned State  Attorney  termed  it,  is  a  mere  afterthought  since  the  appellant conceded  itself that the  notice of confirmation  is as good  as the final determination. We wish to let records of proceedings at page 233 speak for themselves:

"In  the instant case  the appellant was not served with the determination letter rather was served with notice o f confirmation o f statement o f stamp duty which is good as final decision o f  the Commissioner General.  Normally when the respondent issues the notice o f  confirmation assessment to the tax  payer  it means that the determination o f  the objection by the Commissioner GeneraI has reached its finality.  So much as there is no determination letter,  notice o f

## confirmation o f assessment issued by the respondent is final decision upon which this appeal is  founded."

We  are  cognizant  of  the  laid  down  procedures  in  tax  dispute resolution  which  are  meant  to  ensure  due  process  and  fairness  in handling  tax  disputes. However,  the  instant  case  presents  peculiar circumstances  in  which  the  appellant  conceded  that  the  notice  of confirmation  is  as  good  as  the  final  determination.  We  think,  in  all fairness to the parties, the appellant cannot be heard now to complain for something it condoned and actually benefited from at the early stages of the  proceedings  before the  Board  without which  the  matter would have been struck out by the Board for being premature. Entertaining the appellant's  invitation,  would  amount to  shifting  goal  posts  in  order to unfairly benefit the appellant something we are not prepared to extend that far.

It is  also  momentous to observe that,  the  respondent requested from the appellant further information including the PSA as alluded above as one of the necessary documents for determination of the objection, but the appellant elected not to heed to the request. In our considered opinion,  even  if  the  respondent  was  to  make  determination,  it  had nothing upon which to make determination.

We are however, alert to the fact that every case must be decided according to its own peculiar circumstances obtaining in that case. That said,  this  ground  of appeal  too  has  no  merit  and  therefore  it  stands dismissed.

In view of the foregoing position, we find  no merit in the appeal.

Consequently, we dismiss the appeal in its entirety with costs.
