## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

23*1  April, &amp;  2n d July, 2021

## MUGASHA. J.A.:

The appellant,  Commissioner General of Tanzania  Revenue Authority (CGTRA),  is challenging the decision  of the Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal (the  Tribunal)  which  upheld  the  respondent's  appeal  and  reversed  the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board).

In  order to  understand  what  precipitated  the  present  matter  before us, it is crucial  to  briefly  narrate  the  underlying  facts  as  follows:  The respondent is a  company  incorporated  in  Tanzania  involved  in  the  sale  of industrial  detergents and sanitizing  systems.  In  May,  2012, the respondent did sell  its  properties on  Plots  No.  33  and  34  Block 'A' covering  an  area  of 39,090 square meters located at Makuburi Industrial area,  Nyerere Road in Dar-es-salaam held under one certificate of title No. 18607/4.The respondent  paid  capita!  gain  tax  and  value added  tax  (VAT)  in  respect of the said disposition.

Following  an  audit conducted  by the appellant  in  2014  in  respect of the  respondent's  tax  affairs  for  the  years  of  income  2010  to  2012,  on 2/2/2014 the appellant  issued  among others,  an assessment for additional VAT  of  TZS. 664,877,960.00 constituting the principal sum of TZS. 585,811,573/=  plus  interest  thereon  at  TZS.  79,066,387/=  for  the  sold buildings on the land in question. Discontented, the respondent unsuccessfully lodged an objection contesting the assessment  on  the additional VAT. Ultimately, the  objection was  determined against  the respondent and the appellant issued a notice confirming the assessment on additional VAT plus interest thereon.

Aggrieved,  the  respondent  unsuccessfully  lodged  an  appeal  before the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board) challenging the decision of the appellant fronting among other things, a complaint that the additional VAT

demanded by the appellant was not justified because the sale of an interest in  land  is an exempt supply envisaged by section  10(1) of the VAT Act.  On the  other  hand,  the  appellant  challenged  the  appeal  on  account  that, although land and the building were sold as a whole, the prescription of the VAT Act in  the  second  schedule  separated  the  single transaction  into two and  as  such  the  respondent  was  obliged  to  pay  the  additional  VAT  in respect of the  buildings on the  respective  land.  Having  considered what is exempt supply of goods and services  under section  10  (1)  of the VAT Act and  item  8  (1)  and  (2)  of  the  second  Schedule  and  "notes" thereto,  the Board observed at page 179 of the record of appeal as follows:

' ! According ' to the  quoted  provisions  above  they provide  exemption  of goods  and services  to  the description specified in the second schedule to  the VAT Act,  1997.  It is aiso dear that it provides for VA  T  exemption on Land  but it  shaii  not be exempt if the iand  includes a building thereon.

Under the provisions of section  10 (1) of the  VAT Act,  1997 read together with paragraph 8 (1) of  the second schedule  to  the  VAT Act 1997 whenever la n d   s o ld   a s   b a re  is   a n  exem p t  su p p ly   b u t  once build in g erected  thereon the  sam e  is   n o t exem pt supply, hence  when  the property (land) sold it is obvious that the same should be sold as a

whole  and  it  cannot  be  separated. You  cannot separate the  land  and  building  as  the  supply becomes one and the entire consideration becomes VAT  chargeable".

The  Board  finds  the  appellant  is  contradicting himself  in such a way that on one hand  according to the  deed  of safe  signed  between  the  appellant (seller) and Muhsin Guiam Hussein Somji (Buyer) on 2&amp;h   May\  2012,  when  it is referred that the  land together with the buildings were soid  as a whole for USD  1,192,668 inclusive  of VAT while  tax invoice which is appendix 18 shows that the land and the building were not soid as one item.  This makes the Board to  concur  with  the  respondent's  argument that  there  was  an  intention  to  evade  taxes  by separating the two items in the invoices.

Though  the  appellant's counsel in  his submissions claims  that  the  sale  between  the  appellant  and purchaser  indicates  that  the  parties  intended  to effect the sale of the right of occupancy separately from the building erected therein on the ground that the  buildings  were  old and dilapidated but as  we have already  said the deed  o f  sale clearly  shows that the appellant  soid the land  and  buildings as a whole. Even  if the  two  items  were shown  to  have  been separated in the deed of  safe does not eliminate the fact that both are subject to taxation because when the land has a building on it then the two become inseparable  under  the  iaw.  ... the  appellant  was wrong when he separated the land and the building charging  VAT only  on  the  building  and left  land uncharged"

Thus the Board concluded as follows:

Therefore,  the  VAT that the appellant paid on  the building is  just a portion o f  what ought to be  paid. It follows  that  the  respondent  acted  lawful  when demanded for additional VAT  on the sale of  the land and  building,  hence  additional  assessment  issued was  proper."

We shall at a later stage, consider the bolded expression in relation to the  propriety or otherwise  of the  Board's  observation  that whenever  bare land is sold it is VAT exempt supply but once it has a building thereon, it is not VAT exempt supply.

The  respondent  was  not  happy  with  the  verdict  of  the  Board  and preferred  an  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  which  reversed  the  decision  of  the Board and allowed the respondent's appeal  in terms of what is reflected at pages 288 - 289 of the record of appeal as follows:

"... the correct interpretation o f section 10 o f the  Value Added Tax Act, 1997 is  th a t supply o f  g o o d s o r  se rv ic e s  is  an exem pt  su p p ly   i f   it   is o f a description sp e cifie d in the second schedule  to  the A ct,  and item   8   (1 )  to   the schedule  m entions  the  sale  o r  lease  o f  an in te re s t in  lan d ,  th erefo re safe o r le a se  o f an in te re s t in  la n d  is  exem pt su pply. Item 8(2) of the second  schedule mentions sale of  used  or  leased residential building,  in other words sale of used or leased  residential  buildings  is  an  exempt  supply. There is  a note under  item 8(2) which reads:

"For the purposes of  this item does not include any building thereon."

I entirely agree with the submission by the appellants counsel that in ordinary or  plain meaning the whole  item 8(1)  and  8(2)  show  that  the Legislature intended to separate land and buildings../'

Before I  conclude, I  wish to comment on the issue or argument on separating land and building in the tax invoices by the appellant.  It is my considered opinion that what matters is what the law says and what it required the appellant to do as a tax payer. Nothing more."

[Emphasis supplied]

The  appellant  is  discontented  with  the  decision  of the  Tribunal  and has preferred  an  appeal  to the  Court.  In  the  Memorandum  of Appeal,  the appellant has fronted three grounds of complaint as follows:

- 1.  That  the  Tax  Revenue Appeals Tribunal  grossly erred  in  law by  wrongly  interpreting  the  provision  of  section 10  of  the Value  Added Tax  1997  read  together with  item  8  (1)  of the second  schedule to the Act to mean  sale or  lease of interest of  land  is  exempt  supply  without  considering  a  note  under item 8 (2) of the second schedule to the Act.
- 2.  That  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  erred in law  by overturning the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board.
- 3.  That  the  Tax Revenue  Appeals  Tribunal  erred in law  in ordering the appellant  to  vacate  the demand  notice  for payment of additional value added tax.

To  bolster their  arguments  for  and  against the  appeal,  parties  filed written submissions which  were adopted  by the respective  learned counsel at the hearing of the appeal.  At the hearing, the appellant was represented by Messrs.  Harold  Gugami,  Hospis Maswanyia and  Ms.  Alice Mtulo,  learned Senior State Attorneys whereas the respondent had the services of Dr. Alex Nguluma, learned counsel.

The appellant's counsel argued the three grounds of appeal together faulting  the Tribunal's decision which overturned the decision of the Board. On  this,  it was  contended  that, one, the Tribunal  wrongly interpreted the provisions of section  10  (1)  of the VAT Act and  item  8  (1)  of the  second schedule thereto  without  considering  the 'notes'  under  item  8  (2)  thereto because the respondent had paid a portion of the tax payable. As such, the additional  tax  demanded  by  the  appellant  is  justified. Two, since  the respondent  sold  landed  property  with  fixed  improvements  and  buildings thereon  as a  whole at a  sum  of USD  1,192,668,  what is exempt supply  is bare  land  and  not  that  which  contains  any  building  thereon  as  per  the dictates section  10 (1) of the VAT Act read together with  item 8 (1) of the second Schedule and the 'notes' under items 8 (2).  It was further amplified that once a  piece of land  disposed  has any building thereon,  it is not land for  the  purpose  of VAT exemption  under  the  Act.  In  this  regard,  it  was submitted  by the appellant that,  on  account of the  plain  language  used  in the notes, a strict rule of interpretation should be invoked to construe such notes in accordance  with  the principle which was laid down  in the celebrated  case of CAPE  BRANDY SYNDICATE VS INLAND REVENUE COMMISSIONERS [1921] 1 KB  64  and  emphasized  in  the  cases  of CHARLES HERBERT WITHERS BROTHERS  PAYNE VS THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, Civil  Appeal  No.  55  of  1968  EACA

and PAN AFRICAN ENERGY TANZANIA LIMITED VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL, Civil Appeal No. 81 of 2019 ( unreported). It was  further  emphasized  that,  on  account  of  unambiguous  wording  of section  10 of the Act and  item  8  (1)  and  (2)  of the second  schedule,  the buildings  on land sold by  the  respondent  were  not  exempt  which is cemented by the respondent's clear admission that bare land  is an exempt supply for VAT purposes.  Finally, the appellant's counsel urged the Court to allow the appeal with costs and order the respondent to pay the demanded additional VAT.

On the other hand, the respondent opposed the appeal. In addressing  the grounds of appeal the  respondent's counsel  challenged  the appellants'  propositions  that  once  a  parcel  of  land  sold  has  a  building,  it does  not  qualify  for  VAT  exemption  because  he  submitted,  that  is  an erroneous  interpretation  of  the  law  regulating  land  use  and  disposition thereof in Tanzania. It was also argued by the appellant's counsel that land with  any  building  thereon  is  sold  the  two  cannot  be  separated  and  the entire  consideration  is  VAT  chargeable.  On  this,  it  was  the  respondent's argument that the appellant's demand on additional VAT on the sale of the land  and  building  is  not  justified.  Moreover,  it  was  contended  that  the Legislature did  not intend to provide exemption on  bare land which  has no

property or buildings on it or else it would have clearly stated so in the VAT Act by categorizing  sale of bare  land  or undeveloped  land.  Besides,  it was the respondent's argument that the 2n d  schedule does not give an elaborate description  of what  land  or  part of it when  sold  is VAT exempted  and  as such, the term exemption  under the said schedule should  be interpreted in favour  of the  tax  payer  who  sold  an  interest  in  land  and  demonstrated proof of his interest by demolishing the old buildings therein. In this regard, it was the respondent's argument that since the cited provisions do not give a  clear plain  meaning on the tax payable, the appellant's argument inviting the Court to invoke strict rule of interpretation thereof is baseless. To back up the propositions, we were referred to the cases of KEROCHE INDUSTRIES LIMITED  VS KENYA  REVENUE  AUTHORITY  AND OTHERS [2016] 3 and COMMISSIONER  OF INCOME  TAX  VS WESTMONT POWER (K) LIMITED [2006]  1 E.A.  54.  In the latter case it was observed that:

"Taxation  laws  that  have  the  effect  o f depriving citizens  o f  their  property  by  imposing  pecuniary burdens. .... must be interpreted with great caution... any ambiguity in such  a  law must be  resolved in favour of the tax payer and not the public revenue authorities which are responsible for their i mplementation

It was  thus  the respondent's  submission  that,  the  Tribunal was justified  in  looking  at the true  intention of the  parties considering  that the buildings  had  no value on  the  land  in  question  and that  is why they were separated  and  compensated  for book value.  Finally,  the  respondent urged the  Court  to  confirm  the  decision  of the  Tribunal  and  dismiss the  appeal with costs.

In  the  course  of deliberations,  we  were  inclined  to  believe  that the resolution of the issue before us hinged on the effect of 'notes' under item 8 of the second  schedule to the VAT Act.  Having considered  that we were not  adequately  addressed  on  the  issue  as  to  whether  the  'notes' can  be invoked  in  statutory  interpretation,  we  invited  the  parties  to  address  the Court on the issue in question.

It was the appellant's  submission  that,  in  terms of section  25  (2)  of the  Interpretation  of  Laws  Act  [CAP  1   RE.2002],  notes  form  part  of the written law and are internal aid to construction of statutes as they serve as explanatory to the  provisions of the  law.  It was further amplified that it is common to find such notes in statutes which give clarity on the provisions of  the  law.  In  this  regard,  it  was  the  appellant's  contention  that,  notes appearing  under  item  8  in  the  second  schedule  can  be  invoked  in  the

statutory  interpretation  as  internal  aid  to construction.  On  the  part of the respondent,  apart  from  intimating  that  notes  are  part  of  written  law  in terms  of section  25  (2)  of Cap  1,  she  reiterated  that  land  and  buildings cannot be separated and that item 8 in the second schedule does not give an  elaborate  description  of  what  land  or  part  of  it  when  sold  is  VAT exempted.

Having  carefully  considered  the  submission  of  learned  counsel  for either  parties  it  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  respondent  sold  the  land  in question  together  with  buildings thereon  and  paid  capital  gain  tax  on  the two  plots  and  VAT. What  is  in dispute is the  additional tax  of  TZS. 664,877,960/=  demanded by  the  appellant  which constitutes  principal amount and interest thereon in respect of the buildings on the sold piece of land.

We  begin  with  the  position  of the  law on  the VAT taxable  supply of goods  and  services  and  what  is  exempt,  While  the  scope  of  VAT  is prescribed  under the provisions of section 4, what is chargeable under VAT is  a  supply  of  goods  and  services  as  prescribed  under  the  provisions  of section 5 of the Act which stipulates as follows:

- "(1) For  the  purpose of  this  Act, and  unless otherwise provided in this Act or regulations made under it,  "taxable supplies" means supply o f  goods or services made by a taxable person in the course or in  furtherance o f his business after the start of the VA  T  and  includes-
- (a) the acceptance of a  wager or stake in any form  of betting  or gaming including lotteries, bingo, and  gaming machines;
- (b) the making of  gifts or  loans  o f  goods;
- (:) the leasing or  letting o f  goods on hire;
- (d) the appropriation of  goods for personal use or consumption by the taxable person or by any other  person; '
- (s) barter trade and  exchange o f  goods.
- (2)  Where a person produces goods by processing or treating the goods of  another person the supply shall  be regarded  as  a supply  o f  goods.
- (3) The  supply  of any  form  of power,  heat,  or ventilation shall  be regarded  as  a supply  o f  goods.
- (4) Unless otherwise  provided  in this Act  or regulations made thereunder, anything which is not a supply of  goods,  but is done for a consideration,

including the granting,  assignment or surrender of all  or  part  o f  ny  right  is  a supply  o f  services. a

- (5)  The Minister may make regulations  providing for any description of  transaction to be treated  as -
- (a) a supply  of  goods; or
- (b) a supply  of  services; or
- (c) neither  a supply of  goods nor  a supply of services.

## (6) Where-

- (a) goods are neither supplied by a person to another person nor incorporated in other goods produced in the course of the business of the first person but are used by that  person for the  purposes of  furtherance o f  his business; or
- (b) a person in  the course  of his business does anything for the purposes of  furtherance of  his business  which  is not a  supply of services but,  if done  for  a  consideration, would be  a  supply  of services,  the goods or services are regarded for the purposes of this Act as being both supplied to him for the purpose of  the business and  supplied  by him in the course of  that  business".

The  supply  of  goods  and services  which are VAT  exempt  are regulated  by  section  10  (1)  of  the  Act  which  categorically  stipulates  as follows:

"A supply o f  goods or  services is an exempt  supply if it  is  o f a description specified  in the Second  Schedule to this  Act"

What is the rule of construction to be invoked in the interpretation of the cited  provision? The Courts are enjoined to look at what is clearly said in the language used  in tax statute and interpret the statute in the letter of the law because there is no room for looking at the intention of the statute. This  is  what  is  envisaged  in  applying  the  strict  rule  of  interpretation  as  it was  emphasized  in  the  case  of cape  brandy  syndicate  vs  inland revenue commissioners (supra) as it was held:

" In taxing dear words are necessary in order to tax the subject.  Too wide and  fanciful  construction is often given  to  that maxim,  which  does not mean that words are  to be unduly restricted against the Crown , or  that  there  is  to  be  any  discrimination against the Crown in those Acts. I t  s im ply m eans th a t in  ta x in g  one h as to  lo o k  m erely a t w hat is cle a rly said\ There is no room fo r in tendm ent , There  is   no  eq u ity  about  tax.

## There is  no  presum ption as to a tax. N othing is to  be read   in , n o th in g  is  to  be im p lie d ...."

[Emphasis supplied]

Hie said position was emphasized in the case of CHARLES HERBERT WITHERS  BROTHERS-  PAYNE  VS THE  COMMISSIONER OF INCOME  TAX, (supra)  and KEROCHE  INDUSTRIES  LIMITED  VS KENYA REVENUE AUTHORITY AND OTHERS (supra) 3  E.A 205. In the latter case as it was observed that:

"Taxation can only be done on dear words and that taxation cannot  be based  on intendment"

Here at  home,  the  Court  has  taken  a  similar  stance  having  invoked the  strict  rule  of  interpretation  where  the  language  of  words  used  in  a statute is plain including the case of PAN AFRICAN ENERGY TANZANIA LTD VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL TRA (supra) which was cited to us by the appellant's counsel. It was held thus:

"  ■ -in the familiar canon of  statutory construction of plain  language,  when  the  words  of a  statute  are unambiguous, judicial inquiry is  complete  because the courts must  presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what is says  there. As  such ; there  is  no need  for

interpolations, iest we  stray  into the exclusive preserve  of  the  legislature under  the  cloak  of overzealous interpretation."

[ Seealso REPUBLIC  VS  MWESIGE  GEOFREY  AND  ANOTHER, Criminal  Appeal  No.  355  of 2014, RESOLUTE TANZANIA  LIMITED VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL, TRA, Civil Appeal No.  125 of 2017, MBEYA CEMENT  COMPANY  LIMITED  VS  COMMISSIONER  GENERAL  TRA, Civil Appeal No.  160 of 2017 (all unreported)].

We thus wish to emphasise that,  if the words of a taxing statute are clear,  effect  must  be  given  to  them  irrespective  of the  consequences.  In this  regard,  neither  can  the  language of taxing  legislation  be  so stretched as to do favour to the State  nor can  it be  narrowed  to  benefit the  person sought  to be  taxed because  a  taxing enactment  does not  apply by implication and logical extensions  are prohibited. In this regard, with respect, we found wanting the observation of the  Board at page  179 that, whenever  land  is  sold  as  bare  is  an  exempt  supply  but once  sold  with  a building thereon, the same is not an exempt supply. This had the effect of reading  what is not stated  in the law and  it negates the principle of giving full  effect to the language used  in statute.  See PAN AFRICAN ENERGY

TANZANIA LIMITED VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF TRA (supra).

In the light of the stated position of the law and as correctly found by the  Tribunal,  we  are  of  settled  mind  that,  in  view  of the  clear  and  plain language  used  in  section  10  (1)  of the  VAT Act,  it  requires  only  exempt supply of goods and services to be described in the second schedule to the Act and  not more.  In other words, the supply of goods and  services which are  not  VAT  exempt  as  addressed  under  section  5  of  the  Act  are  not envisaged in the second schedule to the Act.

This takes us to considering  notes stated  under item  8(1) and (2) in the  second  schedule.  At  the  outset,  we  agree  with  both  parties  that  in terms of section  25  (1)  of the  Interpretation  of Laws Act,  'notes' are  part and parcel of written  laws and as an  internal aid to construction  of statute it  serves to  explain  and clarify what is contained  in  the statute.  As to how this  can  be  achieved,  we  have  deemed  it  pertinent  to  borrow  a  leaf for what is reflected at pages 39 to 41 of the book Kanga and Palkhivala's Law and  Practice  of  Income Tax by  Arvind  P  Datar,  Volume  1   11th   Edition which  contains a collection of principles on tax cases based on  Indian Tax Law discussing the magnitude and effect of 'explanations' in statute as one of the internal aids to construction in the following manner:

"The object of  an Explanation has been explained in an earlier case  as follows: -

- (a) To explain the meaning and intendment of the Act itself.
- (b) Where  there  is any obscurity or  vagueness in  the main enactment, to clarify the same so as to make it consistent with the dominant object which it seems to sub serve,
- (c) to provide  an  additional support  to  the  dominant object of  the Act in order to make it meaningful and purposeful,
- (d) an Explanation cannot in any way interfere with or change the enactment or any  part thereof  but where some gap is left which is relevant for the purpose of the Explanation,  in  order to suppress the mischief and advance the object of the Act it can  help  or assist the Court in interpreting the true purport and intendment of  the enactment, and
- (e) it cannot, however, take away a statutory right with which any person under a statute has been clothed or set at naught the working of  an Act by becoming a hindrance in the interpretation o f  the same.

An  Explanation  is  intended  to  either  explain  the meaning of certain phrases and expressions contained  in  a  statutory  provision  or, depending upon its language, to take away  something from the content of a  provision,  and at  times,  by  way  of

abundant cautionf  to dear any doubt regarding the meaning  of a  statutory provision. Ordinarily,  an Explanation is  n o t a substantive p rovision  and is   in s e rte d   to   d e a r  up  an  a m b ig u ity  in   th e section and  it should  be  so  read  as to harm onise it  w ith the section because it  is  an in te g ra l p a rt o f the  section and  has  no in d e p en d ent existen ce a p a rt from  the se ctio n . Such  explanations  are  intended  m ore  as  a le g is la tiv e exposition  o r  cla rifica tio n   o f  th e existin g  la w  than a s an am endm ent o r change in   i t B u t  can n o t  be  con strued  to   o verrid e statu te o r  ren d er  the  substance  and  core nugatory.  Explanation  is   n o t  to   enlarge  the scope o f the o rig in a l section th a t it is supposed to explain, if   on a true reading o f  an explanation it  appears th at it  has w idened the scope  o f the  m ain  section,  e ffe ct sh o u ld  be given to the le g isla tiv e  in te n t n o tw ith sta n d in g the  fa ct th a t the Legislature  nam ed  th at provision  as an explanation.  In  rare cases,  it may  even widen  the  scope  o f  the main provision. B u t  m erely  because  a  p ro visio n attached to a section bears the nom enclature 'E xp la n a tio n ',  it  ca n n o t a lw a ys b e  co n sid e re d as conveying the true and natural m eaning o f the w ords o r the p ro visio n s o f the statute.

[Emphasis supplied]

We fully subscribe to the above quotation. We  have  now to consider the 'notes'  under  item  8  of the  second  schedule vis a  vis the  demanded additional  VAT.  At this juncture  it is  pertinent to  reproduce  item  8(1) and (2) and the 'notes' therein as follows:

## " Housing and  iand

- (1) The safe or  leased  of  an interest  in land.
- (2) The safe of  used  or leased residential buildings.

## Notest  For  the purposes  o f th is  item   n ia n d " does n o t  in clu d e  a n y  b u ild in g s th e re o n ."

The  appellant's  counsel  faulted  the  Tribunal  in  not  considering  the notes together with section  10 (1) of the Act and item 8(1) and (2) in the second  schedule.  The  appellant  seems to  suggest that the  liability  of the respondent  to  pay  additional  VAT  is  founded  on  such  'notes'.  Any  tax imposed  on  a  subject  is  dictated  by the  terms  of legislation  and  a  taxing

authority must satisfy itself that the transaction fits within the definition of the statute. See -JAFERALI ALIBHAI  VS  COMMISSIONER  OF INCOME TAX [1961] EA 610.

Since it is settled that,  section  10 (1) of the Act requires only exempt supply  of  goods  and  services  to  be  stated  in  the  second  schedule,  and considering that 'notes' in a statute serve for clarificatory purposes because they  are  not  independent  from  the  section  in  the  law,  the  follow  up question is whether  'notes'  under  the  stated item 8  can salvage  the appellant's  plight.  Our  answer  is  in  the  negative  because,  such  'notes'  in suggesting another category of VAT taxable supply, overrides and enlarges the  scope  of the  legislation  and  it  is  not  compatible  with  the  dictates  of section  10 (1) of the VAT Act, which  strictly requires only exempt supplies required to  be mentioned  in the second schedule.  In a  nutshell, section  10 (1),  items 8 (1),  (2) and notes read together have created an ambiguity on the tax liability of the respondent in respect of the buildings on the sold plot in  question.  We are fortified  in  that account  because the subject is  not to be taxed  unless the words of taxing statute unambiguously impose the tax upon  him.  See the dictum  of Lord  Simonds in RUSSELL (INSPECTOR OF TAXES) VS SCOTT [1948]  2 ALL ER 5 which  was cited  in the case of

n   . . . i n tax  cases  .... the  Court  is  not  entitled  to attempt discovery at the intention of  the Legislature but must restrict itself to  the  clear  words  o f the statute"

In  the case at hand,  apart from the additional VAT tax demanded  by the appellant not being clearly defined, it cannot be classified or determined on the  basis of the 'notes' which apart from  being  beyond the intended  scope  of  the  realm  of  the  enabling  provision  under  which  the second schedule is made, they do not convey the true and natural meaning of section  10 (1) of the Act.  In other words, the 'notes' are not harmonius with  the  provisions  of the  law  creating  the  VAT  exempt  and  non-exempt supply of goods and  services.  In this regard,  notwithstanding that a taxing statute  must  receive  a  strict  construction  it  is  incumbent  on  the  taxing authority to establish that its claims come within the very words used in the statute and if there is any doubt or ambiguity, the benefit thereof must go to  the  assesse.  The  said  ambiguity  can  be  cured  by  legislation:  See  ADAMSON VS ATTORNEY GENERAL [1933] AC 257.

In  view of what we  have  endeavoured  to  discuss,  the  case  of PAN AFRICAN ENERGY TANZANIA LIMITED VS COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF TRA (supra) cited  by the appellant is distinguishable and  it cannot salvage the appellant's plight. In that case, the Court looked at what was clearly stated under the taxing  provisions of the Income Tax Act which categorically  stipulate  that the  Pay as You  Earn  has to  be  deducted  from the  employee's  salary  and  remitted  to  the  tax  authority,  instead  of  the employer' paying from own pocket. Thus, the Court held;

"... we are of  settled mind that, in view of  the dear l anguage  used in  the provisions of sections 7,  81, and 84  of the  Income  Tax Act,  the  employer  is mandatoriiy  required  to withhold  the  employees chargeable tax from  the employment earnings and remit  the  same  to TRA. Thus, the appellant's suggestion  on  non-prohibition  o f the  grossing  up method is interpolations of  what  is not  stated  in iaw. Besides, the appellants argument on there being no harm  on  the  appellant using  own  sources  to pay PA YE on behalf  o f  the employees in effect is reading what is not stated in  the  law and it negates  the principle o f  giving full effect to the language used  in the law."

In view of the aforesaid, we are satisfied that the Tribunal was justified to reverse the decision of the Board and we do not find any cogent reasons to  vary  its  decision.  Thus  the  appeal  is  not  merited  and it is hereby dismissed with costs.
