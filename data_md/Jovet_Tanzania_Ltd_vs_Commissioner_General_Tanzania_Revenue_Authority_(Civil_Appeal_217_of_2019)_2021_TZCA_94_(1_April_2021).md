## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

16"' February &amp;  l u April, 2021

## KWARSKO, 3.A.:

The  appellant,  JOVET  Tanzania  Limited  was  aggrieved  by  the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal (henceforth the Tribunal), (Mjainmas, Chairman)  dated  24t h   June,  2019  in  which,  the  appellant was found  iiab'e  to  pay  taxes  and  duties  on  goods  not abandoned  as assessed  by  the  Commissioner  General,  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority (Commissioner) (the respondent).

For  better  understanding  of  what  transpired,  the  following  brief background  of the  matter will  suffice.  The appellant  is  a  dealer  in  the

business  of  importation  and  supply  of  beverages  named  Bavaria  (the goods). She is also the sole agent for the said goods for its Manufacturer Company  known  as  Bavaria  N.V,  P.O.  Box  1 ,  5737  ZG  Lieshout  of Netherlands. Between  the  month  of September  and  November,  2014 the appellant imported the goods and warehoused at Modern Warehouse No. 570 pending payment of import duties and taxes.

On  behalf of the appellant,  Modern  Holding (EA)  Ltd  (the bonded warehouse), by a  letter dated 2n d   May,  2015 written to the respondent, sought extension for warehousing of the goods with TANSAD Reference Number  TZDL  -  14  -  1135887  where  the  application  was  granted. Thereafter, the appellant claimed that some of the goods had developed flakes thus not fit for sale in Tanzania though the Manufacturer certified that  the  identified  flakes  were  only  organic  materials  and  the  goods were 100 percent safe for consumption.

On  31s t   July,  2015  the  appellant through  the  bonded  warehouse owner wrote a  letter to the Tanzania  Food and  Drugs Authority (TFDA) and  Kinondoni  Municipality  and  copied  it  to  the  respondent. In  that letter  the  appellant  requested  for  the  addressees  to  inspect the  goods which  had developed flakes for destruction  purposes.  However, on  18t h August,  2015 the respondent reminded the appellant to pay duties and

taxes  in respect  of  the  said  goods  before  their  disposal. On  21s t September,  2015  through  its  advocate,  the  appellant  applied  to  the respondent  for  remission  of  custom  duties  in  respect  of  the  goods alleged  to  be  unfit  for  sale  in order  to  allow  their  disposal. This application was  declined  vide  a letter dated 16t h November,  2015 assigning reasons  that  at  the  time  of  importation  the  goods  were examined  and  complied  with  all  requirements  before  clearance  to  the bonded  warehouse. The  appellant was therefore  required  to  pay the custom duties.

Following the said  refusal,  on  18t h   November,  2015  the appellant applied for abandonment of the goods which request was also refused. Undaunted,  on  1s t   March,  2016  the  appellant  unsuccessfully  requested for the respondent to review its decision to refuse abandonment of the goods.

On  being  aggrieved  by the  refusal,  the  appellant filed  an  appeal before the Tax Revenue Appeals Board  (the Board) on a claim that the respondent's decision for its refusal to review the decision in  respect of the application for abandonment of the goods was without reasons thus illegal and unjustified.

The  issue  which  was framed  for determination  before  the  Board was whether the appellant was liable to  pay customs duties and taxes for the abandoned goods. In the end of the hearing, the Board decided that  the  goods  were  examined  and  found  to  comply  with  all  custom requirements before they were cleared to the bonded  warehouse so as to give opportunity to the appellant to find  means of paying  taxes and duties. It  was  also  observed  that  the  goods  expired  following  their overstay in the bonded warehouse due to the appellant's default to pay taxes and  duties. The Board found the appellant liable to  pay custom duties and taxes since the goods were not abandoned.

The appellant was aggrieved by that decision, hence he unsuccessfully appealed before  the  Tribunal. In its decision, the Tribunal  observed  that  the  appellant's  complaint  was  that  the  goods were legally abandoned in accordance with section 56 (1) (a) (b) of the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004 (the EACCMA). However, the Tribunal was of the view that the said provision is invoked where the period for warehousing has expired, when the goods may be sold  by  public  auction  or  private  treaty  with  a  view  to  recover  duties, taxes and other expenses of the sale.  The Tribunal found that according to  section  16  (3)  of  the  Act  and  Regulation  143  of  the  East  African

Community Customs Management Regulations,  2010 (the Regulations), abandonment  of goods  needs  to  be  done  with  the  permission  of the Commissioner  whereby  in  this  case,  he  refused  to  do  so  hence  the appellant was held liable to pay the duties and taxes.

Still  aggrieved,  the  appellant  has  come  to  this  Court  on  appeal upon the following three grounds:

- 1. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in iaw by holding that the Appellant abandonment of  goods without permission of the Commissioner Genera! of Tanzania Revenue Authority was not valid and it is not supported by law.
- 2. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that no abandonment of the goods and remission of duties and taxes by operations of the iaw for goods overstayed in the bonded warehouse if the goods are not commercially viable.
- 3.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in iaw by holding that, the appellant was liable to  pay  taxes  and  duties  on  the  goods  in dispute as they were not  abandoned.

The  counsel  for  the  appellant  lodged  his  written  submissions  in support  of the  appeal  pursuant to  Rule  106  (1)  of the  Rules.  On  the other hand, in compliance  with Rule 106 (7) of the Rules, the respondent's advocate similarly filed their respective written submissions in reply to the appellant's submissions.

At the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Brayson Shayo, learned advocate represented the appellant while  Mr.  Hospis Maswanyia  and  Ms.  Salome Chambai, both learned State Attorneys appeared for the respondents.

Mr.  Shayo adopted  his written  submissions to  be  part of his oral arguments. He submitted generally that the Tribunal did not address the framed  issue,  instead  it determined  matters which  were  not in  dispute between  the  parties.  He  argued  that,  the  Tribunal  stepped  into  the shoes of the  Board  and  its  reasoning  was  based  on  the  issue  whether the  appellant abandoned the goods within  the  ambit of the  law. The learned  advocate  argued  further that both  the  Board  and  the Tribunal failed to interpret sections 56 and 57 of the EACCMA by holding that the appellant did  not abandon the goods therefore was duty bound to pay taxes.  He contended that the appellant was not liable to pay duties and taxes for the goods which lost their value while were still in the customs bonded warehouse and were destroyed unused.

As  regards the first ground  of appeal,  Mr.  Shayo argued that the Tribunal erred to hold that the goods cannot be abandoned without the permission  of  the  Commissioner  because  the  owner  can  decide  to abandon  the  goods  to  the customs and  the  Commissioner  may  permit such  abandonment  subject  to  conditions  he  deems  fit  to  impose.  He wound up the argument in respect of this ground to the effect that, the appellant abandoned the goods by operation of law and voluntarily but he  did  not  accept the  conditions  for  the  abandonment  set out  by the Commissioner.

In respect of the second ground of appeal, Mr. Shayo argued that, the Tribunal's interpretation of section  57 of the EACCMA contemplated a  situation where the goods are commercially viable  but in the present case, the goods were no longer commercially viable.  He argued that the goods were treated  as abandoned  goods  in  terms of section  57 of the EACCMA after refusal by the Commissioner to re-warehouse them.  That the appellant  was prompted  to  apply  for  abandonment  after  the respondent  had  failed  to  take  action  to  auction  the  goods  whose warehousing  in  a  private  bonded  warehouse  attracted  charges. He argued further that as the goods were treated as abandoned, they were subject to  public auction  as per section  57  (2)  (3)  (4)  of the  EACCMA.

That the respondent being  aware of the  law  notified  the owner of the bonded warehouse on  21s t September,  2016 that he could  auction  the goods without further correspondences which  means he was geared to exercise the powers under section 57 of the EACCMA.

The  learned  counsel  stressed  in  the  third  ground  that the  goods were abandoned by operation of law after refusal of extension of time to re-warehouse them pursuant to section 57 or by a voluntary abandonment  of  the  appellant  under  section  56  of  the  EACCMA.  As such,  the  appellant  is  not  liable  to  pay  custom  duties  and  taxes  in respect of such goods.

In  addition  to  the  foregoing,  Mr.  Shayo  submitted  that  it  was illogical  and  illegal  for  the  appellant  to  pay  duties  and  taxes  for  the goods which were not cleared out of the custom control.  In  support of his contentions, Mr. Shayo  referred us  to our  earlier decision in Commissioner General TRA v. Mamujee Products Limited &amp; Two Others, Civil  Appeal  No.  10 of 2018 (unreported) and a Supreme Court of India case of Nirmal Kumar  Parsan  v. Commissioner  of Commercial Taxes &amp; Others, Civil Appeal No. 7864 of 2009

In opposition  to  the  grounds  of  appeal, Mr. Maswanyia  first adopted  the  respondent's written  submissions to form  part of his oral arguments  and  subscribed  to  the  decision of  the Board  and  the Tribunal.

The learned counsel argued in respect of the first ground of appeal that  abandonment  of  goods  will  only  exist  upon  permission  by  the Commissioner  as  per  section  56  (1)  of  the  EACCMA  and  that  the powers to  permit abandonment are discretional.  He submitted that,  in this  case  the  Commissioner  refused  the  appellant's  application  for abandonment of the goods. He argued further that the application for abandonment is provided under regulation  143 of the Regulations and not  section  56  of  the  EACCMA,  and  that  it  is  upon  permission  for abandonment  where  the  owner  of  goods  can  apply  for  remission  of custom duties and taxes.

The learned State Attorney contended that in  this case there was no permission for abandonment from the Commissioner hence there was no abandonment of the goods legally made. He argued that section  57 of the  EACCMA is not applicable because the appellant contravened the law when he applied for remission before the permission for

abandonment of goods. He contended that sections 56 and  57 of the EACCMA serve different purposes.

In  respect of the second and third grounds of appeal, the learned State  Attorney  argued  that  section  57  of  the  EACCMA  was  properly applied by the Tribunal since it relates to re-warehousing of goods which are  commercially  viable,  whereas  in  this  case  the  goods  were  not commercially viable. He added that the Commissioner could  not invoke the  provisions of section  57 of the  EACCMA because the appellant was still  seeking  remedies under section  56 of the EACCMA.  He argued that there  is  no  automatic  abandonment  by  operation  of  law  under  the existing laws.

Mr.  Maswanyia contended that the duties and taxes are payable in this case  because at the time of importation, the goods were examined and complied with all customs requirements before they were cleared to the  bonded  warehouse and  no  permission  for abandonment of custom duties and taxes was given by the Commissioner.

In  respect of the complaint that there is  no law which  allows the Commissioner to charge custom  duties and  taxes on  goods  which  are still  in  the  customs  control,  Mr.  Maswanyia  argued  that  this  is  a  new issue which was not raised as an objection and entertained by the Board

and  the  Tribunal. He  referred  us to  Rule  113  (1)  of the  Rules  which prohibit  a party  to  argue  new  grounds. As  such,  he  urged  us  to disregard this issue. With these submissions, the learned State Attorney urged us to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In  his  rejoinder,  responding  to  the alleged  new  issue,  Mr.  Shayo argued that from the inception  of the case the issue which was agreed upon  for  decision  was  " whether the appellant is liable  to pay custom duties and taxes in respect of the abandoned  goodtf'. He added that he has explained  different  provisions of law which  prohibit the  respondent to charge custom duties on goods which are still in the custom  bonded warehouses and abandoned.

Having considered the submissions by the learned counsel for the parties,  the crucial  issue for our determination  is whether goods under consideration were abandoned. Firstly, the appellant's contention is that, the goods were abandoned by the operation of law after refusal by the respondent to extend the time for re-warehousing of the goods in terms of section  57  (2)  of the  EACCMA.  Secondly,  through  application  by the appellant under  section  56 of the  EACCMA where duties  and  taxes are remitted. The respondent  contended that in the absence of the Commissioner's  permission  under  section  56  (1)  (a)  of  the  EACCMA,

which  permission  was  refused, there wouldn't be any abandonment of the goods. The foundation of the appellant's complaint is section  56 of the EACCMA which provides thus:

## "56.  (1) The Commissioner may, subject to such conditions as he or  she may impose(a) permit the owner of any warehoused goods to abandon such goods to the Customs;

- (b)  permit the  owner of any  warehoused goods  which, in the  opinion  of  the proper officer,  are not worth  the duty payable on them or have  become damaged,  or are surplus,  by reason of any operations in  connection  with  the goods carried out under section 51  to destroy such goods; and in either such case the duty on such goods shail be remitted.
- (2)  Where under subsection (1) any warehoused goods are-
- (a)  abandoned to the Customs,  then such goods may be destroyed or otherwise disposed  of  in  such  manner  as  the Commissioner  may  direct  and  at  the expense of  the owner;

(b)  permitted  to  be  destroyed and such goods were warehoused in a Government warehouse, then the owner of such goods shall nevertheless  be  liable  to  pay  to  the proper  officer the rent  and  other charges due to such goods," (Emphasis ours).

According  to  the  cited  provisions  of  law,  the  Commissioner  has discretionary  powers  subject  to  conditions  he  may  impose  to  permit abandonment of warehoused  goods.  Similarly,  under  section  16  (3)  of the  EACCMA and  Regulation  143  of the  Regulations,  the abandonment of goods should be done with the permission of the Commissioner. The question  which  follows  here  is  whether  the  Commissioner  gave  the permission  to the  appellant to abandon  the goods.  The answer to this question  is  in  the  negative  as  it  is  evidenced  that  the  Commissioner refused the appellant's application for abandonment vide his letter dated 5t h  January, 2016.

The appellant has also contended that the goods were abandoned relying  on  the  provisions  of  section  57  of  the  EACCMA.  For  ease  of reference, we shall reproduce this provision of law as follows:

- "57. (1)  AH  warehoused goods  which  have  not been  removed from a warehouse in accordance with this Act within six months from  the date on  which  they were  warehoused may,  with the written permission of  the Commissionerbe re-warehoused for a further  period of  three months:

Provided that in case of-

- (a) wines and spirits in bulk warehoused by licensed manufacturers of wines and spirits; or
- (b)  goods in a duty-free shop; or
- (c) new motor vehicles warehoused by approved  motor  assemblers  and dealers;

the  Commissioner  may,  in  addition  to  the period  of  re-warehousing  permitted  in  this subsection, allow  for  further  period  of  re­ warehousing as he or she may deem appropriate.

- (2)  Where any goods required to be re-warehoused under subsection  (1)  are  not so  re-warehoused, then  they  shall  be  sold  by public  auction after  one  month's  notice  of such  sale  has been given by the proper officer by

## publication in such manner as the Commissioner may deem fit:

Provided  that  any  such goods which are of  a perishable nature may be sold by the proper officer without  notice, either  by  public  auction  or  private treaty, at any time after expiry of  the initial warehousing period.

- (3)  Where any goods are sold under the provisions of this section,  then  the proceeds of such sale shall be  applied  in  the  order  set  out  beiow  in  the discharge of-
- (a) the duties;
- (b) the expenses of  the sale;
- (c) any rent and charges due  to  the  Customs or to the warehouse keeper;
- (d) the port charges; and
- (e) the freight and any other charges." (Emphasis ours).

While the appellant took refuge under this provision that the goods were  abandoned,  our  understanding  of the  same  is  that the  provision relates to sale  by  public auction  of the goods which  have  not been  re­ warehoused  and  how  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  are  distributed.  The

provision does not at alt deal with the abandonment of goods as claimed by the appellant.

Furthermore, as correctly stated by the Tribunal, the said provision contemplates a  situation  where  the goods  are  not  re-warehoused  and are  commercially  viable.  The  situation  is  different  in  the  case  at  hand because the  goods  in  question  were  not commercially viable.  It  goes without saying that the appellant did not apply and get the Commissioner's permission to abandon the goods and the cited provisions of law do not suggest that there is abandonment of goods by operation of law or voluntarily by the owner. This ground of appeal fails.

The  appellant's  complaint  in  respect  of  the  second  ground  of appeal  relates to the Tribunal's decision to the effect that there was no abandonment  of  the  goods  and  remission  of  duties  and  taxes  by operation of law for goods overstayed  in the bonded warehouse if they are  not commercially  viable.  We  are  of the  decided view that  this complaint raises purely factual matters which this Court has no jurisdiction  to  entertain.  This Court is mandated  to decide tax  revenue matters involving points of law only as clearly provided under section 25 (2) of the Tax Revenue Appeals Act [CAP 408 R.E. 2010] (the Act) thus:

"Appeal  to the Court  of  Appeal  shall  He  on matters involving questions of law only and the provisions  of the Appellate Jurisdiction  Act and the  rules made  thereunder shall apply mutatis mutandis to  appeals  from  the  decision  of the Tribunal."

Going  through  the  record,  we  are  of the  decided  view  that  the appellant's  complaint was  sufficiently dealt with  by  the Tribunal  and  it being on factual matters, it ought to end there.

However, the above position of the law notwithstanding, we have observed the following in relation to this complaint.  It is on record that, the goods were examined and found to have complied with all customs requirements and fit for  human  consumption  before they were cleared to  the  bonded  warehouse  pending  payment  of duties  and  taxes.  Hie goods expired because they overstayed in the bonded warehouse as the appellant failed to pay the taxes within the prescribed period. The record further  shows that the  appellant communicated  with  the  manufacturer concerning  the  said  goods  who  confirmed  them  to  be  fit  for  human consumption. Thus,  if at ali  the appellant intended  to abandon  them  it was because he wanted to preserve the brand and not otherwise. In the circumstances,  she ought to have followed the proper procedure to get

the Commissioner's permission as stated above. Since there was no such permission, it cannot  be  said with certainty  that  the  goods  were abandoned  as  correctly,  in  our  view,  decided  by  the  Tribunal.  This ground too fails.

Before  we  conclude,  we  would  like  to  say  something  about  the issue  raised  by the appellant  '' whether there is no iaw which empowers the Commissioner to charge duties and taxes on goods which are still in the  customs control". We  have  considered  this  matter  and  we  are  in agreement with the respondent that this is a new issue which was never raised  and  dealt  with  by  the  Board  and  the Tribunal.  The  issue  which was raised before the Board was  " whether the appellant is liable to pay customs duties and taxes in  respect of the abandoned goods " . This issue is quite different from the one the appellant raised in the course of his submissions, that there is no law which empowers the Commissioner to  charge  custom  duties  and  taxes  on  goods  which  are  still  under customs control.  In the circumstances of this case,  since the appellant has raised a new issue which was not determined by the Board and the Tribunal, the Court has no mandate to entertain it in terms of section 25 (1) of the Act. This provision empowers the Court to hear and determine

matters which were first heard  and determined  by the Tribunal.  In this regard, the said issue is accordingly disregarded.

In conclusion, it is our general finding that the appellant is liable to pay custom  duties and  taxes as the goods were  not abandoned  which renders the third ground of appeal unmerited.

Consequently, we find the appeal devoid of merit and it is hereby dismissed with costs.
