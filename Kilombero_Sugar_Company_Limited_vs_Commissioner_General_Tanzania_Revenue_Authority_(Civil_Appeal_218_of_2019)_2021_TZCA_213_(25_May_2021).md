Tax Appeal No. 17 of 2016

## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

19th  February &amp; . 25th  May, 2021

## MWAMBEGELE, J.A.:

This  appeal  arises  from  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Revenue  Appeals Tribunal (henceforth "the Tribunal") in Tax Appeal No.  17 of 2016 rendered on  12.02.2016  by  Mjemmas  (Chairman). In  that  appeal,  the  Tribunal upheld  the  decision  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Board  (henceforth  "the  Board") requiring  the  appellant to  pay the  respondent;  the  Commissioner  General of  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority,  Tshs.  469,739,933/=  comprised  in  two

withholding  tax  certificates  issued  to  the  appellant  by  the  respondent  for the years of income 2004/5 -  2007/8 and 2009/10.

The  material  background facts  are  simple.  To  appreciate the appeal before  us,  we  find  it  compelling  to  narrate  them,  albeit  briefly. The appellant,  Kilombero Sugar Company Limited, is a company incorporated in Tanzania  dealing  with  sugar  cane  farming  and  sugar  production. The respondent, the Commissioner General of Tanzania Revenue Authority,  is a tax collection  agent of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania established  under  the  Tanzania  Revenue  Authority  Act,  Cap.  399  of  the Revised Edition, 2006.

On 09.04.1998, the appellant entered into an Operational and Technical  Services  Agreement  with  Illovo  Project  Services  Limited  (IPSL, henceforth  "Illovo"),  a  South  African  Company,  for  the  management  and control of her factories and agricultural  land from time to time. Among the terms of the  agreement was that the appellant would  pay a fixed  amount of USD 30,000.00 per month for the services rendered by Illovo.

The  respondent  conducted  an  audit  on  the  appellant's  business  for the years of income 2004/2005 to 2007/2008 and 2009/2010 whereas the

exit  meeting  note  for  the  year  2004/2005  to  2007/2008  was  issued  on 23.02.2009 and that for 2009/2010 was issued on 03.11.2010. Findings of the audits were that the appellant had an obligation to pay withholding tax on the reimbursements paid as well as for payments to nonresidents.  After several  meetings  conducted  to  discuss  the  audit  report,  the  respondent issued Withholding  Tax  Certificate No. WHT/IR/7/2011 for the  years 2004/05 to 2007/08 on 28.11.2011 requiring the appellant to pay withholding tax of Tshs. 276,547,628/= (being tax due Tshs. 147,087,800/70 and interest thereon Tshs. 129,469,827.30). On 28.06.2012, the respondent issued another Withholding Tax Certificate No. WHT/IRMD/21/6/2012  requiring the appellant to  pay a total  sum of Tshs. 193,192,205/=  (Tshs.  134,598,375/=  being  the  amount  of  tax  due  and Tshs. 58,593,830/= being interest thereon) for the year of income 2009/2010.

The  appellant  was  discontented  with  the  withholding  certificates. She thus,  having complied with the  requirement of paying  one-third of the tax  complained  of  as  required  by  the  law,  lodged  an  objection  with  the respondent. However,  the  respondent  stuck  to  his  guns. Consequently,

the  appellant  lodged  two  statements  of  appeal  in  the  Board  against  the respondent in  respect of each of the two Withholding Tax Certificates.  The appeals, christened Appeals Nos.  2 and 64 of 2012, were consolidated and entertained  as  one. The  kernel  of  contention before  the  Board,  the Tribunal and  certainly before  us is twofold; firsts that the  reimbursements do not  form part of  the service fee paid to Illovo and, secondly, alternatively,  that  if the  reimbursements are  considered  to  be  part  of the service  fee,  they  are  still  not  subject  to  withholding  tax  in  terms  of the Tanzania  -  South  Africa Double  Taxation  Agreement  (henceforth  "the Double Taxation Agreement").

The  Board, in its judgment  rendered  on  01.07.2016,  decided  in favour of the respondent by dismissing the consolidated appeal and holding that  service  fees  must  include  all  costs  incurred  and  that  the  respondent did not  violate the provisions  of  the Double  Taxation  Agreement  by charging withholding tax on payments made to nonresidents.

Still  aggrieved,  the appellant unsuccessfully appealed to the Tribunal which  upheld  the  decision  of the  Board  on  12.02.2019. Undeterred,  the

appellant  preferred  this  second  and  last  appeal  to  the  Court  seeking  to assail the decision of the Tribunal on five grounds, paraphrased as under:

- 1.  By  holding  that  costs  were  included  in  the  term  "service  fee"  the Tribunal  misinterpreted  the  meaning  of the term "service fee" under section  3  of  the  Income  Tax  Act,  2004  and  the  type  of  payments subjected to withholding tax as envisaged under the provisions of the law;
- 2.  The  holding  of  the  Tax  Tribunal  that  "if  it  was  the  intention  of Parliament to separate costs from service fee  it could  have stated  so clearly"  was  an  error  in  law  for  not  considering  that  if  it  was  the intention  of  Parliament  to  include  costs  in  the  term  "service  fee" would have stated so clearly to make costs expressly taxable in terms of Article  138 of the Constitution  of the  United  Republic of Tanzania, 1977;
- 3.  The  holding of the Tribunal that costs is part of service fee and thus taxable  while  determining  the  issue  whether  costs  were  part  of service  fee  and  later  holding  that  costs  were  excluded  from  service fee while determining an  issue whether service fee was covered and

not taxable under the Double Taxation Agreement between Tanzania and South Africa, the same matter and misinterpreting the provisions of the law;

- 4.  Having held that "we agree that section 8 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 2004  directs  that  service  fee is to  be  included in calculating a person's gain or profits from conducting business"  the Tribunal erred in  law for  holding that service fee  is  not covered  under Article 7  (1) of the Double Taxation Agreement; and
- 5.  The Tax Tribunal  erred  in  taw by misinterpreting the  meaning  of the term "profit" as applied in the Doubie Taxation Agreement.

At  the  hearing  of  the  appeal  before  us  on  19.02.2021,  Mr.  Ayoub Mtafya,  learned  advocate,  appeared  for  the  appellant. Messrs.  Hospis Maswanyia and  Cherubin  Chuwa,  learned  State Attorneys and  Ms.  Salome Chambayi,  also  learned  State  Attorney,  joined  forces  to  represent  the respondent. Both  parties  had  filed  their  respective  written  submissions beforehand  for  and  against  the  appeal  which  they  sought  to  be  part  of their  oral  submissions  at  the  hearing. What the  learned  counsel  for  the parties did at the hearing was to clarify on some pertinent points.

In  the  written  submissions  earlier  filed  by  the  appellant,  the  third ground  of appeal  was  abandoned  and  the  fourth  and  fifth  grounds  were consolidated  and  argued  together  as  one. The  rest of the  grounds were argued separately.

On  the  first  ground  of  appeal,  it  was  submitted  that  service  fee  is limited to the charges for skills and professional services that one rendered to  another  and  not  costs  incurred  for  air  tickets  or  costs  of  materials purchased from third  parties. In this case,  it was submitted, the appellant was not charged by the service provider (Illovo). The appellant reproduced the definition of the term "service fee" as defined  by section  3 of the Income Tax Act, 2004 (henceforth "the ITA, 2004") as meaning:

"... a  payment  to  the  extent  to  which,  based  on market values, it is reasonably  attributable to services rendered by a person through a business of that person or a business of any other person and includes  a  payment  for  any  theatrical  or  musical performance , sports or acrobatic exhibition  or any other entertainment performed,  conducted,  held or given".

Mr.  Mtafya also  relied on the definition of the term "fee" provided for in Black's Law Dictionary, 9t h   Edition as meaning:

## "A charge for labor or services, especially professional  services."

On the basis of the foregoing definition, the learned counsel surmised that the term service fee as used  under section 3 of the Income Tax Act is referring  to  payment  for  the  professional  or  labour  of  persons  rendering services.

Mr.  Mtafya also argued that the interpretation that costs are inclusive in  the term "service fee" goes contrary to the type of payments subjected to  withholding  tax  as  provided  for  under  section  83  (1)  of the  ITA,  2004 applicable to the case at hand before its amendments.

He  underlined  that  the  type  of  payments  which are subject  of withholding tax are service fee and insurance premium and those mentioned under sections 82 and 84 of the same Act.  The learned counsel emphasized that these kinds of payments stand  alone;  no cost element is added  to  them. It  was  therefore  incorrect  for  the  respondent  to  impose withholding  tax  on  costs  or  payments  such  as  air  tickets,  air  charter  and

accommodation  by "lumping  all  into  service  fee  while  they  were  separate (not deducted from service fee)"  he argued.  Those payments, the learned counsel  charged,  are  not  professional  fees  and  are  not  mentioned  in  the law as the kind of payment which is subjected to withholding tax.

With  regard  to the  second  ground,  the  learned  counsel  argued  that while justifying  the  imposition  of withholding tax on  payments  such  as air tickets,  air  charter  and  accommodation  as  part  of  the  service  fee,  the Tribunal,  at  p. 780  of  the  record  of  appeal,  was  of  the  view  that  if Parliament  intended  to  separate  costs  from  service  fee,  it  would  have stated  so clearly. He termed this finding as erroneous and argued that,  in terms  of  Article 138  (1)  of  the  Constitution  of  the  United  Republic  of Tanzania,  1977  (henceforth  "the  Constitution"),  if  costs  were  subject  of withholding tax as part of service fee, the law would have stated so in clear terms. The learned counsel  relied on the book by Professor Florens Luoga titled A  Source  Book  of  Income  Tax  Law  in  Tanzania, 2007  to underscore the  rule  that  where  there  is  ambiguity,  the  tax  statute  should be construed in favour of the taxpayer.

Arguing,  in  the  alternative,  in  respect  of  the  consolidated  grounds four  and  five,  Mr.  Mtafya  relied  on  Article  7  (1)  of  the  Double  Taxation Agreement  to  argue  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  holding  that  service  fee includes  costs  and  therefore not profit. He  argued  further  that  the Tribunal,  in  interpreting  the  Double  Taxation  Agreement,  ought  to  have paid  close  attention  to  the  words  such  as  "business",  "business  profit", "categories or items of income" and "what makes up profit".

Mr.  Mtafya also argued that the Tribunal,  having  agreed that section 8 (2) (a) of the Income Tax Act directs that service fee is to be included  in calculating  a  person's  gain  of  profits  from  conducting  business,  ought  to have  held  that  service  fee  is  covered  by  Article  7  (1)  of  the Double Taxation Agreement which recognizes an item of income like service fee as profit in its own right. To buttress this point, the learned counsel also cited to  us  the OECD Commentary in  the Materials  on  International  TP and EU Tax Law, by Kees Van Raad and a book titled International Tax Policy and Double Tax Treaties, 2n d   Edition,  2014 by Kevin Holmes.

Having argued as above, the learned counsel implored us to allow the appeal by quashing the judgment and decree of the Tribunal.

In  response,  Mr.  Maswanyia,  attacked  the  appeal  with  equal  force. In  the  reply  written  submissions  earlier  filed,  the  respondent  argued  that the terms "reimbursement" and "costs incurred" are not one and the same. The  respondent  relied  on  the  meaning  of  the  terms  in Black's  Law Dictionary and  submitted  that  while  the  former  means  "a  duty  to  make good  any  loss  or  damage  or  ...  compensation",  the  latter  means  "the amount paid or charged for something,  price or expenditure" and that the one at issue in the present case is the latter.

Mr.  Maswanyia clarified  on  the written  submissions that section  3  of the  ITA,  2004,  defines the  term  "service  fee" and  the  relevant words are "payment  ...  reasonably  attributable  to  service  rendered". It  was  argued that  since  the  service  provider  could not  have  provided  the  required services without his travel to render such services then the respective costs of fare and air tickets are subject to service fee in terms of section 3 of the ITA,  2004. The  respondent  brands  as  misleading  the  assertion  by  the appellant that service fee  is  payment received for the skills or professional services  because  the  definition  does  not  provide  for any  type  of services. What is  relevant,  he  argued,  is a  payment which  is  attributable to  service

rendered. The  learned  counsel  referred  us  to  p. 102  of  the  record  of appeal  where  payments attributable to service  rendered  and  thus  taxable were  termed  as  reimbursements  while  they  were  costs  incurred  by  the service provider.

With  regard to the alternative argument by the appellant, the subject of the fourth  and  fifth  grounds of appeal,  the  respondent argued  that the ITA,  2004 defines person's income from business for the year of income to  be  the person's gains or profits. When you  talk of profit then  you are  talking  of gains  or  income  and  that  is  what  is taxable  under  the  ITA, 2004,  he  contended. He  argued  further  that  Article  7  of  the  Double Taxation  Agreement  is  irrelevant  as  it  provides  on  the profits which  is cost exclusive while  in the case at hand an  item  at issue  is service fee which is cost inclusive.

On the strength of the foregoing arguments,  Mr.  Maswanyia implored us to dismiss the appeal with costs.

In a  brief rejoinder,  Mr.  Mtafya submitted that the professional fee of USD  30,000.00 was subject of withholding tax  but  not costs  incurred  and reimbursed. He  added  that  the  Double  Taxation  Agreement  does  not

provide  for  the  definition  of "profit"  and  that,  as  per  Article  17  (1)  (7), where profits include items of income which are dealt with in other articles, Article  7  (1) will  not apply. Otherwise Mr.  Mtafya  agreed that in terms of section  83  (1)  (b)  of  the  ITA,  2004,  imposition  of  withholding  tax  on nonresidents  for  the  services  rendered  was  correct; but  not  for  costs incurred  and  reimbursed. He  reiterated  his  prayer  to  have  this  appeal allowed with costs.

Having  heard  the  learned  rival  submissions  and  arguments  by  the learned  counsel  for the  parties,  the  ball  is  now  in  our court to  determine the  issues  of  contention  which  we  think  are, one, whether  the  costs incurred  by  Illovo  and  reimbursed  by the appellant are  part of the service fee  and  thus  subject  to  withholding  tax  and, two, alternatively,  if  the answer to the first issue is in the affirmative,  whether they are not subject to withholding tax in terms of the Double Taxation Agreement.

We  wish  to  start  our  determination by  stating that  the learned counsel  for  the  parties  are  at  one  that  service  fee  paid  to  a  nonresident person  with  a  source  in  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania  is  subject  to

withholding  tax  in  terms  of  section  83  (1)  (b)  of  the  ITA,  2004. The subsection reads:

"83. -(1)  Subject to  the provisions  of subsection (2), a resident  person who -

(a) in conducting a mining business pays a service fee to another  resident  person in respect of management or technical services provided wholly and exclusively for the business; or

(b) pays a service fee or an insurance premium with a source in  the  United Republic to a  non-resident person, shall withhold income tax from the payment at the rate  provided  for  in  paragraph  4(c)  of  the  First Schedule."

The  issue  on  which  the  learned  counsel  for the  parties  have  locked horns  is whether  costs  incurred by  the service provider  (Illovo) and reimbursed  by  the  appellant  are  part  of  service  fee  and  thus  subject  to withholding  tax. In resolving  this  issue, the  Tribunal reproduced  the definition  of  the  term  service  fee  which  we  have  just  reproduced  above. Having  so  done,  the Tribunal  agreed  with  the appellant's  submission  that

service fee includes payments for labour or professional services. However,  it disagreed  with  him  to  restrict the  definition  to  only  labour or professional  services. The Tribunal  observed  at  p.  779  of the  record  of appeal:

"In principle  we agree  with the appellant's counsel that from the definition above,  service fee includes payments for labour or  professionalism. We however  differ  with  him when  he  restricts  the definition  to labour or professionalism. That is to give a very narrow interpretation of  the term service fee. Service fee,  at least,  from the definition given above  may  include  payments  for  other  services which  are  not  necessarily  related  to labour  or professionalism. But even in  that case it does not follow that costs involved in  rendering  the service whether  in  the  form  of labour  or profession  are excluded. It is elementary that there is no activity which has no cost implications, directly or indirectly"

We  share  the  same  reasoning  and  conclusion. The  costs  under discussion  are  air  tickets,  air  charter,  hotel  accommodation  etc. These costs  were incurred by  Illovo when  rendering  services  to, and  were

reimbursed by, the appellant.  We agree with the respondent's counsel that these fall within the scope and purview of payments reasonably attributable to  the  services  rendered  in  terms  of  the  definition  of  the term "service fee" under section  3  of the  ITA,  2004. We are alive to the fact  that  in  terms  of  the  Operational  and  Technical  Services  Agreement between the appellant and Illovo, the service fee and costs were separated and the appellant's counsel complained for the respondent's act of lumping them together for withholding tax calculations. That  notwithstanding,  we agree with the finding of the Tribunal that the separation was only for the convenience  of the  parties;  the  appellant  and  Illovo. In  our  considered view,  the  separation  was  not  meant  to  dissuade  the  respondent  from making  it  exclusive  from  withholding  tax  under  section  83  (1)  (b)  of the ITA, 2004.

In the course of researching on the matter, we came across Practice Note  No.  01/2019 titled Withholding Tax on  Payment for Goods and Services as per Income Tax Act, Cap 332 available at https://tra.QQ.tz/Imaaes/headers/Withholdinq-Tax-on-payment-for-

Goods.pdf. which we found useful in our determination of the appeal.  The

Practice  Note  is  made  under section  9  of the Tax Administration  Act,  Cap 438 (henceforth "the Tax Administration Act"); which powers the Commissioner also wielded under the now repealed section  130 of the ITA, 2004.  The Practice Note provides under clause 10.0 thereof:

## "10.0 Inclusion of  value of  benefits and facilities

Where  services  are  provided  and  payments  are made  to  the  withholdee  of cash plus provision  of benefits and facilities, the withholding tax base shall include the amount  paid for the benefits or facilities. Where the benefits were not paid for,  they shall be quantified at a market value at the time of  payment. Furthermore; where services are provided and payments are made to the withholdee in form of service  fee and reimbursements  then  the withholding tax base  will be the full amount that is service fee plus reimbursement amount . "

[Emphasis supplied]

The Practice Note goes on to give an example:

"FLG Consultants  were  hired by Kinondoni District Council  to  carry  consultancy  work. The  contract

terms involved  payment of  reimbursement expenses which  were  used for accommodation  in  a  5 star hotel for 4 staff of FLG for  20  days by the client. The contract price was quoted at Tsh 150,000,000/=  plus  reimbursements. The Client Paid a total of Tsh 16,000,000/= as reimbursement expenses for accommodation of  FLG staff.

DESCRIPTION

AMOUNT (Tshs)

Consultancy Fee

150,000,000/=

Reimbursements

16,000,000/=

Total

166,000,000/=

W/Tax Base

Consultancy fee 150,000,000/=

Reimbursements 16,000,000/=

W/Tax Base 166,000.000/= "

The  Practice  Note  above  clarifies  that withholding  tax  shall  be calculated on the gross amount  paid without deduction of expenses or allowances. In  the  above  example,  the  withholding  tax base  was  calculated  on  the  consultancy  fee  (Tshs.  150,000,000/=)  plus reimbursements (Tshs.  16,000,000/=).  Thus the withholding tax base was Tshs.  166,000,000/=. We are of the view  that the  Practice  Note  depicts

the correct position of the  law and that is what should  have  been  done in the case at hand.

We are aware that the  Practice  Note  was  made  under  section  9  of the  Tax  Administration  Act. However,  we  are  certain  that  the  position holds  true  to  the  one  which  obtained  under  the  ITA,  2004. We  say  so because the Tax Administration Act cross-refers the definition of "withholding  tax"  in  section  3  thereof  to  "tax  which  is  required  to  be withheld  by  a  withholding  agent  from  a  payment  under  Subdivision  A  of Division II of Part VII of the Income Tax Act". For the avoidance of doubt, section  83  (1) (b) falls under Subdivision A of Division  II of Part VII of the ITA, 2004 cross-referred to by the Tax Administration Act.

For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  we  are  alive  to  the  position  that  the Court  is  not  bound  by  Practice  Notes. This  is  so  because,  the  task  to interpret  laws  is  the  exclusive  domain  of  the  court. However,  we  are certain  that the  Practice  Note  is  an  external  aid  to  construction  providing guidance  in  the  interpretation  of  a  provision. At  this  juncture  we  find irresistible to associate  ourselves  with Kanga  and  Pakhivala's the  Law and Practice of Income Tax by Arvind P.  Datar,  11t h  Edition, at p. 35 on

the  role  of  the  courts  in  interpretation  of  laws  in  relation  to  Circulars, Forms and Interpretation by the Income Tax Authorities in India:

"31. Circulars,  Forms  and  Interpretation  by the Income-tax  Authorities. -Circulars or genera / directions  issued by  the  Central  Board  of Direct  Taxes would be binding under s.  119 on all officers and persons employed in the execution of the Act, but they cannot  bind the appellate authority,  the  tribunal ' the  court or  the  assessee. The Board cannot pre-empt a judicial interpretation of  the scope and  ambit of  the provision of  the act by a circular, as the task of  interpretation of  laws is the exclusive  domain  of the  court. Circulars  may be utilised to understand the scope and meaning of  the provision  to  which  they relate. These circulars,  or the interpretations of provisions of the Act by the CBDT or  the  Income-tax  Department  are  in  the nature of contemporanea expositio furnishing legitimate aid  in the construction of  a provision'

We subscribe to that exposition and hold that the same holds true in our jurisdiction as well.

The above stated, we, like the Board and Tribunal, find and hold that payments  made  by  Illovo  as  costs  incurred  in  rendering  services  to,  and reimbursed  by, the appellant are part of service fee subject to withholding tax  under section 83 (1) (b) of the ITA,  2004. The first issue, the subject of the first and second grounds of appeal, fails.

We now turn to consider the second  issue which was argued  by the appellant in  the alternative;  the  subject of the fourth  and  fifth  grounds of appeal. Our  starting  point  will  be  Article  7  (1)  of  the  Double  Taxation Agreement.  It provides:

## " Article 7

## Business Profits

[Compare: OECD Mode! / UN Model]

- 1.  The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall  be  taxable  only  in  that  State  unless  the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated  therein.  If the  enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of  the enterprise  may be  taxed in  the  other State  but only so  much  of them  as is attributable  to  that

## permanent establishment"

Mr.  Mtafya  argued that this article  is applicable to the case  at hand. The thrust of his argument was that service fee is a charge on professional services or skills and  has no cost element attached to it. Thus, he argued, it forms part of a business profit to Illovo carrying on  business in Tanzania. He  added  that  even  if  the  Court  finds  that  costs  incurred  by  Illovo  and reimbursed  by  the  appellant  are  part  and parcel  of  service  fee,  that notwithstanding,  such  service  fee  is  not  subject  to  withholding  tax  in Tanzania pursuant to Article 7 of the Double Taxation Agreement.

On  the  other hand, the respondent  strongly  argued that  costs incurred by Illovo and  reimbursed  by the appellant were so incurred  in the course  of  rendering  services  to  the  appellant  and  therefore  cannot  be excluded  from  the service fee component. Besides, the respondent argued,  the  article  is  not  applicable  to  the  present  situation  because  it provides for business profits which  is cost exclusive while  in the case at  hand  the  item  at  issue  is service fee which  is cost  inclusive. The same argument arose in the Tribunal and it (the Tribunal) agreed with the reasoning  of the  Board  that the  relevant article  here was  not Article  7(1)

but Article  21  of the  Double Taxation Agreement. We hasten the  remark that this,  in  our considered view,  is the correct exposition  of the  law. We also  find  the  argument  by  the  respondent that Article  7  is  not talking  of service fees but business  profits as making  a  lot of sense. We agree that the  relevant  provision  in  our  case  is  Article  21  of  the  Double  Taxation Agreement  which  provides  for  "other  income". In  demonstrating,  we prefer to start with reproducing Article 20 thereof which states:

## ' ! Article 20 Other Income

[Compare: OECD Mode! / UN Model]

Items of  income arising in a Contracting State which are not dealt with in  the foregoing Articles of this Agreement may be taxed in that State."

Likewise, Article 21 provides on how  double  taxation shall be eliminated in Tanzania and South Africa:

## ' ! Article 21 Elimination of  Double Taxation

[Compare: OECD Model / UN Model]

Double taxation shall be eliminated  as follows:

- (a) in  South  Africa,  subject  to  the provisions  of

the law of South Africa regarding the deduction from tax payable in South Africa of tax payable in  any country other than  South Africa  (which shall  not  affect  the  general principle  hereof), Tanzanian tax paid by residents of South Africa in  respect  of income  taxable  in  Tanzania, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,  shall be  deducted  from  the  taxes due according to South African fiscal law.  Such deduction shall not, however, exceed an amount which  bears  to the total  South  African tax payable the same ratio as the income concerned bears to the total  income;

- (b) in  Tanzania,  subject to  the provisions of the law of Tanzania  regarding  the  allowance  of a credit to a Tanzanian resident against Tanzanian tax of  tax  payable in a territory outside Tanzania (which  shall  not  affect  the  general  principle hereof),  South African  tax paid by residents of Tanzania in respect of income taxable in South Africa,  in accordance  with  the provisions of this Agreement,  shall be  deducted  from  the  taxes due  according  to Tanzanian  fiscal  law. Such credit shall not exceed the  amount of the  tax

chargeable upon the income in respect of which the credit is to be allowed or upon each part of such income,  as the case may be,  computed in accordance with Tanzanian fiscal law."

Flowing  from  the  above,  as  service  fee  is  an  item  which  does  not feature  anywhere  in  the  Double Taxation  Agreement,  Article  20  becomes handy. The  costs  incurred  by  Illovo  and  reimbursed  by  the  appellant (which  we  have  already found  and  held  to  be  part of service  fee)  will  be taxable  in  Tanzania  as  per  Article  21  of the  Double Taxation  Agreement. Put differently,  it  is  our  considered  view  that,  as  per the  Double Taxation Agreement, service fees by a South African entity for provision of professional  services to  a  Tanzanian  entity,  do  not  form  part of  business profits  as  provided  for  under Article  7  of the  Double  Taxation  Agreement which  is  not  taxable  in  Tanzania  but  fall  under  Article  21  of  the  Double Taxation Agreement and thus subject to withholding tax in terms of section 83  (1)  (b)  of the  ITA,  2004. The  alternative  argument  by the  appellant, the subject of the fourth and fifth grounds of appeal, also fails.

The  sum  total  of the  above  discussion  is  that  we  find  nowhere  to fault the findings of the Tribunal in upholding the decision of the Board, for

it is based on the correct interpretation of our tax legislation as well as the Double  Taxation  Agreement. This  appeal  is  arid  of  merit. It  stands dismissed with costs to the respondent.
