## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

14th  August &amp; 29t h   December, 2023

## MWARIJA. J.A.:

This appeal is against the decision of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal  (hereinafter "the  Tribunal")  handed  down  on  25/6/2021  in Appeal  No.  1 0   of 2020.  That appeal  originated  from  the  decision  of the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (hereinafter "the Board") in Customs and Excise Appeal (C &amp; E Appeal) No. 13 of 2018 between the parties herein,  LAKAIRO Investment Limited and  the Commissioner General, Tanzania Revenue Authority (the Commissioner).

The  facts  giving  rise  to  the  appeal  m ay  be  briefly  stated  as follows: The appellant herein was dissatisfied with the demand by  "the respondent for payment of taxes and duties amounting to a total of TZS 4,067,188.39 on exit goods alleged to have been illegally diverted by the appellant into domestic market without payment of taxes and duties. The demand was made vide the Commissioner's letter dated 24/1/2017.

As  a result  of  having been  aggrieved by  the  demand  for payment of the above stated amount of taxes and duties, through his advocate, the appellant appealed by way of an application for review. He  contended  that,  the  calculations  were  based  on  external,  not internal tariffs while the goods were manufactured in Kenya within the East  African  Community.  The  respondent  did  not  respond  to  the application  for  review  within  the  period  of  30  days  of  the  date  of receipt  of  the  letter  as  required  by  s.  229  (4)  of  the  East  African Community Customs Management Act,  2004 (the EACCMA).  Instead, he  wrote  to  the  appellant  on  19/12/2017  requiring  him   to  pay  the demanded amount.

Following that reply, the appellant decided to institute the C &amp; E Appeal  before  the  Board  seeking inter aiia ;   a   declaration  that,  since the goods originated from Kenya, within the East African Community, the assessment of the demanded taxes and duties ought to have been based on the  East African Community's preferential  rates of 0% and VAT at  18%  instead  of Common  External  Tariffs  rates  of 25%  and VAT at 18% which was applied by the respondent.

At  the  hearing  of  the  C  &amp;  E  Appeal  before  the  Board,  the respondent  raised  a  preliminary  objection  that  the  appeal  was  filed out of the period of 30 days of the date of receipt by the appellant, of the  demand  letter  contrary  to  s.  229  (1)  of  the  EACCMA. It  was argued  by  the  respondent's  counsel  that,  whereas  the  demand'for payment of taxes and  duties was  made  by the  respondent vide  his letter dated  24/1/2017,  the  appellant filed  his application  for  review before  the  Board  on  1/3/2017  thus  beyond  the  prescribed  period  of 30 days.  On his part, the appellant's counsel countered the argument that the  C  &amp;  E   Appeal  was filed  out of time. He argued  that,  time started  to  run  from 12/2/2017  when  the  respondent  replied  the appellant's letter of application for review dated 29/11/2017.

According  to  the  appellant's  counsel,  the  appeal  lodged  before  the Board  was against the  respondent's decision  communicated  through his  letter  dated  12/12/2017  not against the  demand  made vide the letter dated 24/1/2017.

Having considered the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties, the Board agreed with the learned counsel for the respondent that  the  C  &amp;  E   Appeal  was  filed  out  of time.  Notwithstanding  that finding,  the  Board  was  conversely  of  the  view  that,  because  the respondent  did  not  reply  to  the  appellant's  application  for  review within  the  period  of  30  days  prescribed  under  s.  229  (4)  of  the EACCMA  but  did  so  on  21/11/2017  after  the  period  of  about  9 months,  it  ought  to  have  considered  the  appellant's  application  'for review because,  in the circumstances, the application for review was not rendered time barred.  On that reasoning, the Board overruled the preliminary objection and proceeded to allow the application. It stated as follows in its ruling at page 154 of the record of appeal;

"...since both parties were out of  time in terms of  section 229 of  the EACCMA, it is our opinion that the Board proposes a way forward. In the result therefore, in the interest of  justice , it is our  settled  opinion that the respondent's preliminary  objection is overruled  and  the application  for review be allowed so  that the issues are sorted out and the legitimate duties and taxes are paid without further delay."

The respondent was aggrieved by the decision of the Board and thus appealed to the Tribunal. He contended, among other grounds, that the  Board  erred  in   proceeding  to  determine  the  C  &amp;  E  Appeal after  it  had  found  that  the  application  for  review  lodged  with  the respondent was time barred. The Tribunal found that, from the parties submissions before the Board, there was no dispute that the appellant was served  with  the  demand  letter on  24/1/2017  and therefore,  by filing the application for review on  1/3/2017 it did  so out of tim e.-  It also  considered  the  argument by the  appellant that the  preliminary objection  was not based  on  pure point of law allegedly because the date on which the demand note was served to it was not ascertained. The Tribunal  was of the view that, the argument was without merit because, as stated above, there was no dispute as regards the date of service upon the appellant of the demand letter. Having so found, the Tribunal allowed the appeal.

The appellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the Tribunal hence this appeal which is predicated on the following seven grounds:

- 1. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in iaw by upholding the respondent's appeal which was predicated on a preliminary objection which was not  purely  based  on a  point  of  iaw.
- 2.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in iaw by failing to properly address and consider the provisions of  section 50 (3) (c) (ii) of  the Tax Administration Act, [Cap 438 R.E 2019] as they relate to determination of time limit for lodging an application for review under the provisions of section  229  (1)  of the  East Africa  Community Customs Management Act, 2004.
- 3.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in iaw by holding that the appellant's application for review was time barred
- 4. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in iaw by holding that there was no valid application  for review before  the  Commissioner to  be  considered in  terms  of the provision  of section  229  (1)  of the  East Africa  Community Customs Management  Act 2004.
- 5. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that there was no final determination  subject  of  appeal  to the Tax Revenue Appeals Board in terms of  Section 53 of the Tax  Administration Act, [Cap 438 R.E. 2019].
- 6. That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law  by  holding that  the trial Tax  Revenue Appeals  Board had no jurisdiction  to  entertain the appellant's appeal lodged before it from the decision of  the respondent
- 7.  That the  Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal erred in law by holding that there was no decision which was made by the respondent in respect of the time barred application for review and that the appellant herein had nothing to complain about or  to  be  dissatisfied  with  for  him  to  lodge  a competent appeal before  the  trial Board  while the respondent herein had already been deemed by law to have allowed the appellant's application for  review."

At the  hearing of the appeal, the appellant was represented by Mr.  Yusuf Mohamed assisted by M r. Jovin Ndungi,  (earned advocates while  the  respondent  was  represented  by  Mr.  Hospis  Maswanyia, learned  Senior  State  Attorney.  The  appellant  did not  file  written submissions  and  therefore,  the  appeal  was  argued  orally. The appellant's counsel  argued together grounds  1 , 2, 3  and  4  and  later grounds 5, 6 and 7 .

Starting with the 5t h , 6t h and 7t h grounds  of  appeal, Mr. Mohamed  argued  that,  by  failing  to  respondent  to  the  appellant's application  for  review  of  the  assessed  taxes  and  duties  within  the prescribed period of  30 days  from the  date  of  receipt  of  the application as required  by s.  229 (4), the  respondent was deemed to have allowed it in terms of s. 229 (5) of the EACCMA.

For  that  reason,  the  learned  counsel  went  on  to  argue,  the Tribunal erred in holding that, there was no decision of the respondent  which  could  be  challenged  by  the  appellant  before  the Board while to the contrary, there was a decision dated  12/12/2017 which,  he  said,  was the subject of the  appellant's  appeal  before -th e Board.

In  reply,  M r.  Maswanyia  opposed  the  argument  made  by  the appellant's counsel that the demand note did not constitute a decision capable of being challenged  by way of an application for review. It

was the learned Senior State Attorney's submission that, the appellant's  letter  dated  29/11/2017  to  which  the  respondent  replied vide  his  letter  dated  12/12/2017,  was  not an  application  for  review. He  stressed  that,  the  appellant  appealed  against  the  respondent's decision  communicated  to  it  through  the  demand  for  payment  of taxes and duties.

The  issue  which  arises  from  those  grounds  is  whether  or  not there was an appealable decision of the respondent prior to its letter to the  appellant  dated 12/12/2017.  According  to  the  appellant's counsel,  it was through  that letter the  respondent communicated  its decision, to the appellant and  therefore,  it was against such decision not the demand for payment vide the letter dated 24/1/2017, thatthe appellant lodged its application for review.

We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the  parties on  the above  stated  grounds of appeal.  We  need  not be detained  much  in  answering  the  issue  stated  above.  We  hasten  to state that,  the  argument  by the  learned  counsel  for the appellant is without merit. It is clear from the  record that,  in  his application for review the appellant was challenging the decision communicated to it by the  respondent vide the  demand  note dated  24/1/2017. In  the application for review, the appellant prefaced it by stating that:

"We  refer to  the  above matter;   the  Demand from Mr. Njaufe Mdendu, Manager Control and Enforcement, and  hereby  withdraw  all  our previous correspondence and now write  to apply  for  a  review  in  respect  of  the Demand."

## [Emphasis added]

Clearly therefore,  the  answer to the  issue  is that,  the application-for review  was  against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  requiring  the appellant to pay Tshs. 4,067,711,188.39. That decision was communicated to it through the letter dated 24/1/2017.

On  the  first  four  grounds  of  appeal  (the  1 s t ,  2n d ,   3r d   and  4t h grounds), the learned counsel for the appellant began by faulting the Tribunal for having failed to find that, the preliminary objection raised by the  respondent during the trial was wrongly entertained  because the same was not based on pure point of law.  He contended that, the date on which the appellant was served with the demand note by the respondent was not ascertained and therefore,  in order to determine whether  or  not  the  appeal  before  the  Board  was  filed  within  the

prescribed time, evidence was required for that purpose. He cited the famous  decision  in  the  case  of Mukisa  Biscuit  Manufacturing Company Limited v. West End  Distributors Company Limited [1969] E.A 696 to support his argument.

The learned counsel for the appellant challenged also the finding by the Tribunal that, the application for review was time barred.  In its decision, which was overturned by the Tribunal, the Board found that the  application  for  review  was  filed  outside  the  period  of  30  days prescribed under s. 229 (1) of the EACCMA but held that, because the respondent  did  not  also  make  a  reply  to  the  appellant's  letter  of application for review within the period of 30 days in terms of s.  229 (4) of the EACCMA, the delay by the appellant was excusable.

In  reply to the submissions made in support of the  1 s t ,  2n d ,   3r d and 4t h  grounds of appeal, M r. Maswanyia argued that, the appellant's application  for  review  was  served  on  the  respondent  outside .the period of 30 days of the date when the former received the letter of demand  to  pay  the  assessed  taxes  and  duties.  According  to  the learned Senior State Attorney, since the application was time barred in

terms of s.  229  (1)  of the  EACCMA,  the  respondent  had  nothing  to consider by way of a review.

He argued further that, in its decision at page  121 of the record of appeal,  the  Board  found that the application  was time barred and since the  appellant did  not challenge  that finding  by way of a  cross appeal, its move to bring up the issue calling for ascertainment of the date  of service  of the  demand  note  is  nothing  but an  afterthought. On  those  arguments,  the  learned  Senior  State  Attorney  prayed  that the appeal be dismissed.

Having  duly considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties on the  1 , 2 , 3  and 4t h  grounds of appeal, we are of the settled  mind  that the  same  are  devoid  of  m erit.  To  begin  with the argument  that  the  preliminary  objection  was  not  based  on  a  pure point of law allegedly because the date of service upon the appellant, of  the demand  note  was  not  ascertained, we  agree  with Mr. Maswanyia that the contention is without merit.  There was no dispute before the Board as regards the date of service of the demand  note on  the  appellant.  In  his  submissions  in   support  of  the  preliminary objection, Mr. Maswanyia is recorded to have stated as follows:

"...the Commissioner for customs made its decision dated 24h  January 2017.  In that view,.,  in relation to section 229 (1) of  the EACCMA, 2004 the 30 days began to run against the appellant on 24h  January 2017."

The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  did  not  dispute  that contention by the respondent.  His argument which was, with respect, a  misconception,  was that the appeal  before the  Board  was against the decision communicated to the appellant through the respondent's letter  dated 1/3/2017.  In  its  finding,  the  Board  agreed  with  the computation as submitted by the respondent's counsel and thus based its finding on that computation. The Board's finding was not challenged by the appellant by way of a cross-appeal. It cannot thus be heard to complain at this stage, on the issue of the date of service which he did not dispute at the trial before the Board.

With  regard to the  contention  that the  finding  of the Tribunal that  the  application  for  review  was  time  barred  is  erroneous,  we similarly find no merit in the arguments made by Mr. Mohamed, In its decision, the Board found that, the appellant had lodged his application for review outside the period of 30 days prescribed under

s.229 (1) of the EACCMA. It observed as follows in its ruling at page 151 of the record of appeal;

"It  is  undisputed  from  the  circumstances  of this  case  that  the  letter  dated  24h   January 2017 by the respondent to the applicant Is the tax  demand  note  in  this  case. This  tax demand note was objected by the applicant on 3&amp;h  January 2017 but was disregarded by the applicant by the fetter dated 1 s t march 2017 which is an application for  review.  Therefore, it is undeniable that the application for review was made after the mandatory 30 days had elapsed contrary to the requirement  of s.  229  (1)  of the  EACCMA, 2004"

## [Emphasis added].

Contrary to that finding however, the Board went on to state as follows in its ruling at page 152 of the record of appeal:

"With the foregoing explanation, we are of  the unanimous  opinion  that  both  parties  in  this case did not carry out their respective submissions  and reply  within  the  mandatory prescribed  time  by  law. Hence  based  on evidence on record adduced by the parties in

## this  case , it is  deemed that the present appeal is competent before the Board."

## [Emphasis added].

With respect, we find that the Tribunal was justified to disagree with the reasoning of the  Board. This is  because,  as is well  known, two wrongs do not make a  right. The fact that the respondent had delayed  to  respond  to  the  appellant's  application  for  review  did  not have the effect of condoning the delay on the part of the appellant. Section  299 (4) of the EACCMA applies only where an application-for review is filed within time. It does not, as held by the Tribunal, apply to  an  incompetent  application. In  that  regard,  the  provisions  of section  50  (3)  (c)  (ii)  and  5 3   of the Tax Administration Act,  Chapter 438 of the Revised laws cited by Mr. Mohamed are of no assistance to the appellant.

Of course, we agree that, as matter of good  practice and as a responsible  Authority,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  appellant's letter of application for review was time barred, the respondent ought to  have  replied to it promptly. However, his failure to do so did  not have the effect of regularizing the defects of the appellant's

application. The available remedy on the part of the appellant was to apply for extension of time. In our considered view, the Tribunal was right in its finding that the Board erred in proceeding to entertain the application for review after having found it to be time barred. In the event, we dismiss the appeal with costs.
