## TAXATION OF SPECIALISED INDUSTRIES

Some businesses are taxed slightly differently from others. The industries of these businesses are generally called specialised industries. They include businesses in mining, insurance, banking and pension funds. This Study Guide discusses the computation of tax liability for these specialised industries.

Excluding the provisions of The Income tax Act 2004 discussed in this Study Guide, the treatment of business income for all other entities remains the same.

Knowledge obtained from this Study Guide will be useful to you when you are employed / act as a consultant for companies dealing in specialised business.

- a) Calculate tax liability for insurance businesses.
- b) Calculate tax liability for banks.
- c) Calculate tax liability for pension funds.
- d) Calculate tax liability for mining companies.
- 1. Calculate tax liability for insurance businesses.

## 1.1 Meanings

'Insurance business' means the business of an insurer in effecting, issuing and carrying out insurance (Section 3)

'Life insurance' means insurance of any of the following classes:

- (a) Insurance where the specified event is the death of an individual who is the insured or an associate of the insured;
- (b) Insurance where:
- (i) the specified event is an individual who is the insured or an associate of the insured sustaining personal injury or becoming incapacitated; and
- (ii) the insurance agreement is expressed to be in effect for at least five years or without limit of time and is not terminable by the insurer before the expiry of five years except in circumstances prescribed by the regulations;
- (iii) insurance under which an amount or series of amounts is to become payable to the insured in the future;

and

(iv) re-insurance of insurance referred to under paragraphs (a) to (c). (Section 3)

'Life insurance business' means the business of an insurer in effecting, issuing and carrying out life insurance (Section 3)

'General business' means any insurance that is not life insurance; (Section 3 of The Income Tax Act, 2006)

## 1.2 Calculation of tax liabilities for insurance business

The calculation of tax liabilities for insurance businesses does not differ much from other businesses.

## Taxpayers who carry on insurance business should, for tax purpose, separate general insurance and

life insurance business from other businesses (Section 58(1) and 59(1)).

This separation is very important because taxation of insurance payments may depend on whether they are received from general or life insurance business.

## General insurance business income

In fact, when calculating income from general insurance businesses, all premiums derived during the year of income by the person as insurer, including as re-insurer, and proceeds derived during the year of income by the person under any contract of re-insurance should be included in the person's income.

Likewise, the persons should deduct proceeds incurred during the year of income by the person as insurer, including as re-insurer and premiums incurred during the year of income by the person under any contract of reinsurance (Section 58(2)). Furthermore, the insurance company may deduct ordinary business expenses and commissions.

Income from general insurance business (during a year) =

## Premiums received by the person as insurer, re-insurer

Add:

Proceeds from re-insurance

Less: Proceeds you pay out as insurer or re-insurer

Less: Any premiums paid to re-insurers where you take out re-insurance

Less: Ordinary business expenses and commissions.

## Life insurance business income

However, the calculation of income from life insurance business should not include premium derived during the year of income by the person as insurer, including as re-insurer and proceeds derived during the year of income by the person under any contract of re-insurance (Section 59(1)). Likewise, no deduction or inclusion in the costs of assets or liability of proceeds incurred during the year of income by the person as insurer, including as re-insurer and premiums incurred during the year of income by the person under any contract of re-insurance is allowed (Section 59(2)). However the insurance company may deduct ordinary business expenses and commissions.

## TIP

Income from life insurance business (during a year) should not include the premium received as insurer, re-insurer and proceeds earned under any contract of re-insurance.

Ordinary business expenses and commissions can be deducted as expenses.

Also do not include expenditure on proceeds you pay out as insurer or re-insurer, or premiums paid to re-insurers where you take out reinsurance.

With the exception of these differences, all other treatments of income and expenses remain the same as we have discussed in the earlier Study Guides.

## Example

Best insurance company carries on both general and life insurance. In the last year, the company received Tshs100, 000,000 as premium from general insurance and paid Tshs 20,000,000 as compensation to generalinsured customers.

Also, the company received Tshs 50, 000,000 as premium from life insurance and paid Tshs 20, 000,000 as Compensation to life insured customers. The management expenses for general and life insurance were Tshs10, 000,000 and Tshs7, 000,000 respectively. Additionally, the company has taxable income of Tshs10, 000,000 from non-insurance business activities.

## Required:

Calculate the tax liability of the company if the tax rate was 30%.

## Answer

The income from general insurance, life insurance and other businesses should be computed separately.

- (a) Income from general insurance is Tshs70, 000,000,000 (Tshs100, 000,000 - Tshs20, 000,000 - Tshs10, 000,000 = Tshs70, 000,000)
- (b) Loss from life insurance is Tshs7, 000,000 (0 - Tshs7, 000,000 = Tshs-7,000,000) as premium and payment in life insurance are not included.
- (c) Income from other business activities is Tshs10, 000,000.
- (d) Total income is Tshs73,000,000 (Tshs70,000,000 - Tshs7,000,000 + Tshs10,000,000 = Tshs73,000,000).
- (e) Tax liability at 30% is Tshs21, 900,000.

## 2. Calculate tax liability for banks.

Though banks are categorized as special entities, taxpayers who conduct banking businesses are taxed as other businesses. However, debt claim of a financial institution may become a bad debt, and is therefore deductible only after the debt claim has become a bad debt as determined in accordance with the relevant standards established by the Bank of Tanzania (Section 25(5)).

As in other businesses, exempt income is not included, final withholding payments are excluded and only deductible expenses are deducted as discussed previously. In short, there is no difference between other businesses and banks, other than the sources of income and types of expenses. For example, banks have interest as the main source of income while other businesses usually have sales the as main source of revenue.

' Banking businesses' means business of a financial institution approved under the Banking and Financial Institutions Act. ( Section 3)

'Financial institution' means a bank or financial institution approved under the Bank of Tanzania Act or the Banking and Financial Institutions Act. (Section 3)

## 3. Calculate tax liability for pension funds.

'Retirement fund' means any entity established and maintained solely for the purposes of accepting and investing retirement contributions in order to provide retirement payments to individuals who are beneficiaries of the entity. (Section 3)

## Example

Moonbeam Ltd contributes each month to a pension fund. This fund invests the amounts of contributions and makes payments towards pension out of the returns on investments. This plan is a funded plan.

## Definition

' Retirement payment' means a payment, by way of a lump sum, pension or commuted pension, made by a person to an individual in the event of the individual's retirement or a relative of an individual in the event of the individual's death. (Section 3)

There are some differences between approved pension funds and other businesses on how they compute their taxable revenues and deductible expenses.

In the case of taxable revenue, retirement contributions received by a retirement fund are not taxable (Section 62(2)). On the other hand, retirement payments made by the fund are not deductible, and are not included in the cost of any asset or liability of the fund (Section 62(2)).

## Example

The following information relates to the financial data of Joseph Pension fund for the year ending 2012. Your duty is to determine the tax liabilities of the company for that year.

|                                        | Tshs      |
|----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Retirement contribution                | 6,000,000 |
| Investment income                      | 2,000,000 |
|                                        | 8,000,000 |
| Less:                                  |           |
| Retirement payments                    | 1,000,000 |
| Management expenses                    | 2,000,000 |
| Depreciation allowance as per ITA 2004 | 1,000,000 |
| Income before tax                      | 4,000,000 |

There is no tax liability as the company incurred a loss of Tshs 1,000,000.

|                             | Tshs        |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Profit as per account       | 4,000,000   |
| Add: Non allowable expenses |             |
| Retirement payment          | 1,000,000   |
| Less: Non-taxable income    |             |
| Retirement contribution     | (6,000,000) |
| Taxable loss                | 1,000,000   |

However the information provided above mentions that the fund is approved only up-to 31 December 2011, therefore we should re-compute the taxable income as follows:

| Item                                                                                             | Tshs         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Profit as per account                                                                            | 4,000,000    |
| Add: Taxable income due to removal of approval Retirement contribution from residents            | 150,000,000  |
| Less: Deductible expenses due to removal of approval Retirement payments to resident individuals | (80,000,000) |
| Taxable income                                                                                   | 74,000,000   |
| Tax payable at 30%                                                                               | 22,200,000   |

## Transfer of funds among retirement benefits

Also, in the case of transfer of funds among retirement funds, the treatment of the transfer depends on whether the retirement funds involved are approved or not.

When the transfer of funds involves approved retirement funds the transfer is neither considered a retirement contribution nor a retirement payment (Income Tax Act 2004, Regulation 11(1)).

But, in the case of a transfer of funds from approved retirement funds to unapproved retirement funds;

it is not considered retirement payment from the point of view of the approved retirement funds, but it is a part of taxable income of the unapproved retirement funds (Income Tax Act 2004, Regulation 11(2)).

However, in the case of a transfer of funds from unapproved retirement funds to approved retirement funds; the transfer is not deductible by the unapproved retirement fund and it is neither considered a retirement payment nor a contribution (Income Tax Act 2004, Regulation

11(3)). Yet, when the transfer of funds involves unapproved retirement funds, the transfer is not considered a retirement payment and the transfer will be exempt in the recipients' hands but not deductible by the payers (Income Tax Act 2004, Regulation 11(1)).

## Diagram 1: Accounting of Pension Funds

Approved retirement funds            .the transfer is neither considered a retirement contribution nor a retirement payment

Transfer of funds from approved .For approved fund: It is not considered retirement payment retirement funds to unapproved   .For unapproved fund: It is a part of taxable income retirement funds

Transfer of funds from unapproved .For unapproved fund: It is not deductible i.e it is neither retirement funds to approved            considered a retirement payment nor a contribution retirement funds                                  .For the approved fund: it will be exempt in the recipients' hands

'Contract area' in respect of petroleum operations means the area that is subject of petroleum agreement and whenever any part of contract is relinquished pursuant to petroleum agreement, it represents the contract area as originally granted.  Section 3

'Mining operations' means prospecting mining or operations connected with prospecting or mining carried out pursuant to rights granted under the Mining Act. Section 3

' Mining area' means an area of land that is subject to a special mining licence, a mining licence, or a primary mining licence.  Section 3

' Petroleum agreement' means a contract, license, permit, or other authorization made or given pursuant to the applicable law and it includes authorization or production sharing contract made under the respective law.  Section 3

' Natural resource' means minerals, petroleum, water or any other non-living or living resource that may be taken from land or the sea.  Section 3

There are two major differences between taxation of mining companies and other businesses: treatment of provision, restriction of expenses and loss deduction, (i.e. ring fencing of the deduction of revenue expenses) and the treatment of capital expenses in exploration and development activities.

## 4.2 Deduction of provision expense, restriction of expense and losses

Where all other persons are not allowed to deduct any provisions, taxpayers conducting a resource extraction business are allowed to deduct provision for environmental expenditure but they have to apply and be allowed by the commissioner. (Section 15(3)). Also where taxpayers engaged in mining or petroleum operations have separate and distinct mining or petroleum operations in a different mining area or petroleum contract area, they should determine allowable deductions separately for each mining area or petroleum contract area (Section 11(4)).

Additionally, expenditures incurred in exploration activities outside the mining licence area of the mining operation are not deductible, but they should be accumulated and allowed when the commercial operations commence (Section 11(5)). Finally, deduction of loss incurred on petroleum operations is allowed in computation of income derived from the contract area as it is the deduction of loss incurred on mining operations, which is allowed only in computation of income from the mining area (Section 19(2)). These restrictions of deduction imply that taxable income or loss from each mining area or petroleum contract area should be calculated separately.

## 4.3 Exploration and development expenditure

There is 100% deduction of capital expensing on exploration and development expenditure incurred in mining activities. The question here is what does exploration and development expenditure mean. These definitions are still provided by the second schedule of the Income Tax Act 1973 (Section 145).

According to the schedule there is 100% deduction of expenses incurred in searching for or in discovering and testing deposits of minerals, or in winning access to those deposits, whether or not such search is, or such deposits are, in an area contiguous to any mine in relation to which such person carries on mining operation (Section 16 (1), ITA 1973). This also includes expenditure incurred in the acquisition of rights in or over such deposits, other than the acquisition from a person who has carried on mining in relation to such deposits.

Furthermore, they include expenditure incurred in acquisition or uses of machinery which would have little or no value to such person if the mine ceased to be worked on the end of the year. Other deductible capital expenditures include those incurred on the construction of any building or work which would have little or no value if the mine ceased to be working at the end of the year, and on development, general administration and management prior to the commencement of production or during any period of nonproduction (Section 16 (1), ITA 1973).

However, expenses incurred on the acquisition of the site of such deposits, or of the site of any such buildings, work, or of right in or over any such site, works constructed wholly or mainly for subjecting raw produce of such deposits to any process except a process designed for preparing the raw product for use as such are not deductible (Section 16 (1) ITA 1973).

Furthermore, when a person purchases the right to carry on mining production from other persons who have explored and developed the mining, the price by the buyer should be treated as exploration and development expenditure (Section 20 (2)); while the seller is treated as receiving taxable revenues and used in calculating taxable income (Section 21).

However, the commissioner may divide the amount received by the seller into maximum of 6 portions and one such portion should be used to ascertain the total income of such vendor for the year of income in which such sale took place and for each of the previous years of income corresponding to the number of such portions (Section 21).

## Example

The following is the financial information of Walaa Mining Company for the year ending 2012. Calculate the taxable income and liability of the company for the year ending 2012.

## Notes:

- 1. The depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are based on the accounting policy of the company, while the depreciation allowances given by the ITA 2004 schedule were Tshs18,000,000 and Tshs11,000,000 for ZZ-mining and KK-Mining respectively.
- 2. General exploration and business development include business development costs of Tshs
- 4, 000,000 in each mining areas to develop exploration ramps.

The company had tax payable amounting to Tshs6, 000,000 from ZZ-Mining and there was no tax liability from KK-Mining area, and the loss of Tshs 2,000,000 cannot be used to reduce the company's tax liabilities.
