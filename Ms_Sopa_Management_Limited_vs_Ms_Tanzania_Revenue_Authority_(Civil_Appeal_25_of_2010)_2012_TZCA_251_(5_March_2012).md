## JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

29th  February &amp; 05t h  March, 2012

## MUNUO. J.A:

On the 26t h  September,  2000, the  High Court of Tanzania,  Mushi J. &lt; s struck out Civil Case No. 22 of 1998 with costs for lack of jurisdiction to determine  matters  relating  to  hotel  levy,  sales  tax,  stamp  duty  and  car benefit imposed on the present appellant, SOPA Management Ltd. by the Tanzania Revenue Authority, now the respondent.  Three and a half years

later,  the  respondent  decree  holder  lodged  a  Taxation  Cause  for  Bill  of Costs  totaling  shillings  514,753,580/=  costs  of  the  suit  which  the  High Court struck out on the 26t h  September, 2000. On being served with the Bill of  Costs, Mr. Maro, learned advocate  for  the  appellant, filed a 3 , t preliminary  objection  to  the  effect  that  the  Taxation  Cause  was  time barred. In  his Written Submission in support of the preliminary objection, Mr.  Maro,  learned advocate, quoted the learned author,  B.B.  Mitra on  his Commentaries. On  the  1963  Indian  Law  of  Limitation  Act.  The  Book  is titled the Limitation Act 1963, 20t h  Edition, Eastern  Law House, Delhi  1998 at page 1 1  wherein it is stated;

"an unlimited  and  perpetual  threat  of  litigation creates  insecurity  and  uncertainty  some  kind  of li mitation is essential  for  public  order."

Learned  Counsel  Maro  also  referred  to  McGee,  Commentaries  on Limitation  Periods,  2n d   Edition,  i994 at  page  5   where the  learned  author refers to the policy and spirit behind the limitation period thus:

"...Arguments with regard to the policy underlying statutes of  limitation fall  into three main types. The first relates to the position of the defendant It is said to be unfair that a  defendant should have a claim hanging over him for an indefinite period and it is this context that such enactments are sometimes described as "statutes of  peace. "  The second looks at the matter from a more objective point  of  view. It  suggests  that  a  time  limit  is necessary because with the lapse of  time, proof  of  a claim becomes more difficult, documentary evidence  is  likely So have  been  destroyed  and ■ i memories of witnesses will fade. The third relates to  the  conduct of the plaintiff. It being  thought right that a person^viho does not promptly act to enforce  his  rights  should  lose  them. All  these justifications have been considered  by the courts."

In  the  Written  Submission  on  the  preliminary  objection,  learned advocate Maro also referred to item 21 of Part III to the First Schedule to .   . i the Law of Limitation Act, 1971 which provides, interalia;

"21.  Application  under  the  Civii  Procedure  Code, 1966,  the  Magistrates  Courts Act,  1963  or  other written law which no period of  limitation is  provided in this  Act  or  any  other written law. ..... sixty  days"

Before  us,  Mr.  Maro  did  not*refer to  McGee  but  he  referred  to the Indian  Limitation Act by the learned^authbrs B.B.  Mitra,  M .  R .  Malick,  20t h Edition, Eastern  Law  House  1998  pages  10,  11,  1171  and  1183  and numerous other authorities to support the appeal, all stressing the need to comply with the prescribed Law of Limitation.

On  his  part, Dr. Mapunda,  learned  advocate  for  the  respondent resisted the preliminary objection. He contended that the Taxation Cause t was within the prescribed period^Mimitation under the provisions of item 20 to the  First Schedule,  Part III of the  Law of Limitation Act,  1971,  Act No. 10 which states:

"To  enforce  a judgment,  decree  or order of any court where the period of  limitation is not  provided for  in this  Act  or  any  other written law.  ....12  years."

Dr.  Mapunda  submitted th§t ! the Bill  of Costs falls  under item  20 of the First Schedule, Part III of the Law of Limitation Act, 1971. He stated in his  Reply  to  Mr.  Maro's Written  Submission  on  the  preliminary  objection that the  said  objection  was  misconceived,  novel,  unprecedented  and  has no merit at all.

The Taxation  Master,  Mr.  Shabani  Lila,  as he them was,  upheld  the preliminary objection giving  rise to Miscellaneous Civil Cause No.  9 of 2006 in  the  High  Court  of  Taftztnia ^ in   which  counsel  for  the  present i . % respondent asked the High Court to quash the Ruling of the Taxing Master and let the Taxation Cause proceed on' merit.  In the Reference to the High Court either party stuck to their guns: *

Dr.  Mapunda contending that the Bill of Costs falls under item 20 to the  First Schedule of the  Limitation "A ct,  1971  which  provides a  limitation

period of 12 years while Mr.  Maro insisted that the period of limitation for applications of Bills of Costs is sfxtf days so the Taxation Cause instituted by the decree holder is time barred.  Chocha, J.  ruled that the Bill of Costs falls under item 20 of the First Schedule,  Part III of the Law of Limitation Act,  1971 so it is within the prescribed period of limitation of 1 2 years.  The learned  judge  ordered  that  the  Taxation Cause  be  heard  on merit. Dissatisfied, learned counsel for the appellant preferred the present appeal.

Mr. Maro,  learned  advocate  for  the  appellant  filed  2   grounds  of appeal namely:

- 1.  That the  High  Court  erred  in  law  treating  as  and holding that a Bill of Costs constitutes an application for execution.
- 2.  That the  High  Court eri&amp;d  in  law  in  holding  that Taxation  Cause  No. 13  of  2004  was  not  time barred.

Hence, counsel for the ap^fllnt #ged us to quash and set aside the decision  in  Miscellaneous  Civil  Reference  No.  9  of  2006  with  costs. We

wish to note here that the said Miscellaneous Civil Reference No. 9 of 2006 was instituted as Miscellaneous Civil Cause No. 9 of 2006.

In  this  appeal,  Mr.  Maro observed  and  Dr.  Mapunda  conceded  that there is no period of limitation for filing a Bill of Costs for Taxation and that such matter would fall under iterril 20 Q r 21 of the 1 s t  First Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1971.

Counsel for the appellant faulted the learned judge for holding that a bill  of costs  is  a   step  towards  enforcement of the judgment thence the period of limitation for bills of costs should fall under the provisions of item 20  to  the  First  Schedule  Part  III  of the  Law  of  Limitation  Act  No.  1 0   of 1971,  which  is  1 2   years. Mr.  Maro  maintained  that  bills  of  costs  are ^1, &gt; v applications for determining the^©st£ #ent in litigation so they fall  under item  21  to the  First Schedule III  of the  Law of Limitation,  1971  which  is sixty days only which means the respondent's bill of costs was time barred because  it  was  filed  3 Vi years  after  the  judgment  awarded  the  same. Citing B.  B.  Mitra  The  Limitation  Act  1963  12t h   Edition  by  M.  R. Mallick,  Calcutta  new Delhi  Eastetli  Law House page 528, counsel for the  appellant  submitted  that a  bill  of costs  is  not  part of the  decree

which  enjoys  a  period  of  limitation  of  1 2   years;  rather  a   bill  of costs  is instituted by filing application are and applications not specifically provided for under the Law of Limitation, such application  falls under the provisions of  item  21  of the  First  Schedule to the  Limitation  Act,  1971  which  is  2 1 days.

The issue is whether the Bill of Costs in dispute is time barred.

This matter need not detail) us.'.*While it is true that a bill of costs is linked to the decree to the extent that the decree holder would  be entitled to costs of the suit if there is no order for withholding costs, a bill of costs is instituted separately as an appticdtioifto determine the costs of litigation on  the  part of the  successful  party. Because the  Law of Limitation  Act, 1971 does not provide a period of limitation for lodging a bill of costs, such application would in law fall under item 21 to the First Schedule Part III of the Law of Limitation Act, 1971, which states inter-alia\

"21.  Application  under  th&amp;  Civil  Procedure  Code, 1966,  the  Magistrates  Court Act,  1963 or other written law of which no period of  limitation is provided in this A %0 ? W W n y  other written law .... Sixty  day."

In  view  of  the  clear  provisions  of  item 21,  the learned  judge erroneously reversed the decision of the Taxing Master. Hence, we quash and  set  aside  the  decision  of  Jh e 'High  Court  and  hereby  restore  the ^ - ■ ■ A f t ' decision of the Taxing Master.  We are satisfied, therefore, that under item 21 of the First Schedule of the Law of Limitation Act,  1971, the Bill of Costs presented in Civil Cause No.  13/2004 arising from No. 22 of 1998 was time barred.

In the result the appeal has merit and is hereby allowed with costs.

DATED at Arusha  this  5t h  .day of  .March, 2012.
