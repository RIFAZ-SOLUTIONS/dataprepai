## THE EAC SINGLE CUSTOMS TERRITORY

<!-- image -->

## Background

The Treaty for the establishment of the EAC was signed in November  1999  and  entered  into  force  in  July  2000. According  to Article  5(2)  of  the  Treaty,  the  Partner  States undertook to establish  a Customs Union, a Common Market, a  Monetary  Union  and   ultimately  a  political  federation  in order to enhance their economic, social, cultural and political development and integration for their   mutual benefit.

The  Protocol  establishing  the  EAC  Customs  Union  was concluded  in  2004  and  implementation  commenced  in January 2005. The implementation of the Customs Union was envisaged to be progressive  and  so  far  a  number  of  milestones  have  been  achieved towards the attainment of the goal of a fully-fledged Customs Union.

In  April 2012, the summit considered the report of the Council of Ministers on the attainment of a Single Customs Territory and  agreed  in  principle  to  adopt  the  Destination  Model  of clearance  of  goods  where  assessment  and  collection  of revenue is done at the  first point of entry .

## What is Single Customs Territory (SCT)?

A Single Customs Territory is described as a stage towards full  attainment  of  the  Customs  Union  which  is  achievable by the removal of restrictive regulations and /or minimizatio internal border  controls  on  goods  moving  between  the PartnerStates with ultimate realization of free circulation of goods. The EAC SCT covers Partner States namely Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

## How the SCT operates

The SCT will be implemented premised on the three pillars namely:

- • Free circulation of goods
- •   Revenue management systems, and
- •   Regional legal and institutional framework.

## Free circulation

Goods originating from one Partner State to another within the Customs Union are not subjected to Customs Tariff as long as they  meet  the  EAC Rules of Origin criteria. Goods imported from outside the Customs Union which have been entered and released  for  home  consumption  are  free  to  circulate  within the  Community.  Each  category  requires  unique  modalities depending on the customs regime under which they are declared.

## Imports into the EAC region

A Common External Tariff applies to all goods imported into the EAC region. The goods may be for direct home use, warehousing or transit through a Partner State.
