## Calculations for Excise Duty

## Scenario: Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing Sector

## Company Profile

Name

: GreenHarvest Ltd.

Sector

: Agriculture

Business : GreenHarvest Ltd. is a Tanzanian company specializing in the production and sale of fruit juices. The company operates a large fruit processing plant where it manufactures various types of fruit juices, including apple, orange, and mango juice.

## Production Details

-  Volume of Fruit Juices Produced :
-  Excise Duty Rates for FY 2023/24 :
- o Unfermented Fruit Juices (including grape must) : 9.9 TZS per liter
- o Imported Powdered Juice
- : 255.2 TZS per liter

o Apple Juice: 50,000 liters

o Orange Juice: 30,000 liters

o Mango Juice: 20,000 liters

Since GreenHarvest Ltd. produces unfermented fruit juices locally, the applicable excise duty rate is 9.9 TZS per liter for their products.

## Excise Duty Calculation

## 1. Calculate Excise Duty for Apple Juice

 Quantity Produced

: 50,000 liters

 Excise Duty Rate

: 9.9 TZS per liter

Excise Duty for Apple Juice = Quantity Produced × Excise Duty Rate

= 50,000 liters × 9.9 TZS/liter

= 495,000 TZS

## 2. Calculate Excise Duty for Orange Juice

 Quantity Produced

: 30,000 liters

 Excise Duty Rate : 9.9 TZS per liter

Excise Duty for Orange Juice = Quantity Produced × Excise Duty Rate

= 30,000 liters × 9.9 TZS/liter

= 297,000 TZS

## 3. Calculate Excise Duty for Mango Juice

 Quantity Produced

: 20,000 liters

 Excise Duty Rate

: 9.9 TZS per liter

## Excise Duty for Mango Juice = Quantity Produced × Excise Duty Rate

= 20,000 liters × 9.9 TZS/liter

= 198,000 TZS

## Total Excise Duty

Total Excise Duty = Excise Duty for Apple Juice + Excise Duty for Orange Juice + Excise

Duty for Mango Juice

= 495,000 TZS + 297,000 TZS + 198,000 TZS

= 990,000 TZS

## Summary

##  Total Excise Duty Payable by GreenHarvest Ltd. : 990,000 TZS

In this scenario, GreenHarvest Ltd. is required to pay a total excise duty of 990,000 TZS based on the volume of fruit juices produced and the applicable excise duty rate. This duty is payable to the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) as part of their tax obligations.

If there are any additional complexities or specific situations related to the excise duty calculation for GreenHarvest Ltd., such as exemptions or additional duties on other products, they would need to be taken into account as per Tanzanian tax laws.

## Scenario: Mining and Quarrying Sector

## Company Profile

Name

: RockSolid Ltd.

Sector

: Mining and Quarrying

Business : RockSolid Ltd. operates a quarry and is engaged in the extraction and processing of crushed stone aggregates, which are used in construction and other industrial applications.

## Production Details

-  Volume of Crushed Stone Aggregates Produced : 100,000 cubic meters
-  Excise Duty Rates for FY 2023/24 :

o Cement : 20 TZS per kg

Since RockSolid Ltd. produces crushed stone aggregates, which is a raw material rather than a finished product like cement, the excise duty on cement does not apply directly to their primary product. However, if RockSolid Ltd. were to produce or sell cement, the excise duty would be applicable.

## Example Calculation for Cement (Hypothetical Scenario)

Assuming RockSolid Ltd. also manufactures cement as a by-product or in addition to their crushed stone aggregates:

## Cement Production Details

 Volume of Cement Produced : 10,000 kg

## Excise Duty Calculation for Cement

 Excise Duty Rate

: 20 TZS per kg

Excise Duty for Cement = Quantity Produced × Excise Duty Rate

= 10,000 kg × 20 TZS/kg

= 200,000 TZS

## Total Excise Duty

Total Excise Duty Payable by RockSolid Ltd.

: 200,000 TZS

## Summary

In this scenario, if RockSolid Ltd. produces and sells cement, they would be required to pay an excise duty of 200,000 TZS based on the volume of cement produced and the applicable excise duty rate. Since the primary business is the extraction of crushed stone aggregates, the company would not be subject to excise duty for its main product unless it engages in the production of excise-dutied goods like cement.

If there are specific details or additional products that RockSolid Ltd. handles which fall under different excise duty rates, those would need to be considered separately based on Tanzanian tax regulations.

## Scenario: Manufacturing Sector

## Company Profile

Name

Sector

: Manufacturing

Business : ABC Beverages Ltd. is a Tanzanian company specializing in the production of various types of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine.

## Production Details

-  Volume of Beer Produced : 70,000 liters
-  Volume of Wine Produced : 15,000 liters

## Excise Duty Rates for FY 2023/24:

 Beer Made from Malt :

o Rate: 620 TZS per liter (if local)

 Wine with More Than 25% Imported Grapes :

o Rate: 5,600 TZS per liter

 Wine with Domestic Grapes or Other Local Content :

o Rate: 200 TZS per liter

Assuming ABC Beverages Ltd. produces local beer and wine, with varying content of imported grapes:

## Excise Duty Calculation

## 1. Calculate Excise Duty for Beer

 Quantity Produced : 70,000 liters

 Excise Duty Rate

: 620 TZS per liter

Excise Duty for Beer = Quantity Produced × Excise Duty Rate

- = 70,000 liters × 620 TZS/liter
- = 43,400,000 TZS

## 2. Calculate Excise Duty for Wine with Imported Grapes

 Quantity Produced : 5,000 liters

 Excise Duty Rate

: 5,600 TZS per liter

Excise Duty for Wine (Imported Grapes) = Quantity Produced × Excise Duty Rate

- = 5,000 liters × 5,600 TZS/liter
- = 28,000,000 TZS

## 3. Calculate Excise Duty for Wine with Domestic Grapes

 Quantity Produced

: 10,000 liters

 Excise Duty Rate : 200 TZS per liter

Excise Duty for Wine (Domestic Grapes) = Quantity Produced × Excise Duty Rate

= 10,000 liters × 200 TZS/liter

= 2,000,000 TZS

## Total Excise Duty

Total Excise Duty Payable by ABC Beverages Ltd. = Excise Duty for Beer + Excise Duty for Wine (Imported Grapes) + Excise Duty for Wine (Domestic Grapes) = 43,400,000 TZS + 28,000,000 TZS + 2,000,000 TZS

- = 73,400,000 TZS

## Summary

##  Total Excise Duty Payable by ABC Beverages Ltd. : 73,400,000 TZS

In this scenario, ABC Beverages Ltd. is required to pay a total excise duty of 73,400,000 TZS. This amount is based on the volume of beer and wine produced, with different rates applying to products depending on their content and type. The excise duty is payable to the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) as part of their tax obligations.

If ABC Beverages Ltd. were to produce other excise-dutied products or if there are any exemptions or special rates applicable, those would need to be incorporated into the total calculation.

## Excise Duty Rates for FY 2023/24:

## Summary

In this scenario, PowerPlus Ltd. does not incur any excise duty on the electricity or natural gas it supplies, based on the provided excise duty rates. Their business operations are thus not directly affected by excise duties on these products.

If there are specific regulations or other types of products or services they provide that might be subject to excise duties, those would need to be considered separately. For instance, if PowerPlus Ltd. were involved in the production or sale of any excise-dutied products like lubricants or certain machinery, those would be subject to different rates.
